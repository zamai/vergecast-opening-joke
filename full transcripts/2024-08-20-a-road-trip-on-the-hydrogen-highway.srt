Description: Today on the flagship podcast of hydrogen futures: 

The Verge’s William Poor, Andrew Marino, and Alex Parkin head to California to figure out why hydrogen fuel cell technology, once a super-promising successor to gasoline, lost out to battery electric cars. They also put the embattled tech to the test with a road trip across California’s “hydrogen highway.”


2
00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:06,645
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Hydrogen Futures. I'm your

3
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:09,975
Speaker 2:  friend David Pierce and I am trying to

4
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:13,845
Speaker 2:  redecorate a bit. So if you watch The Vergecast on YouTube,

5
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:17,685
Speaker 2:  you've noticed that we just recently got a really awesome new studio in our

6
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,545
Speaker 2:  New York office. You may have also noticed that Neli got a really awesome

7
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:25,425
Speaker 2:  new studio in his house. So I'm very jealous of all of this, which has really

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,285
Speaker 2:  led me to spend, I would say, an inappropriate and unnecessary amount of

9
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:33,245
Speaker 2:  time trying to figure out my own background. I feel like everyone went through

10
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:36,645
Speaker 2:  this like in 2020 when we all started being home more often. You started

11
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:39,725
Speaker 2:  to be aware of kind of how your space looks on

12
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:43,605
Speaker 2:  camera. I make a podcast on camera now, and so

13
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:47,315
Speaker 2:  I notice it more than is probably healthy or reasonable and

14
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:50,085
Speaker 2:  I've just been trying to figure out how do I make this look a little nicer,

15
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:53,695
Speaker 2:  a little more studio ish and less like the basement

16
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:57,365
Speaker 2:  slash home office slash guest room slash child

17
00:00:57,365 --> 00:01:01,045
Speaker 2:  PlayPlace that it actually is. So I suggested this to Liam,

18
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:04,045
Speaker 2:  our producer, that maybe I want to do some stuff. He sent me a long list

19
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:07,825
Speaker 2:  of things to do. He wants me to put blinds on the window. He wants me

20
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:11,685
Speaker 2:  to move the guitar that's over here, but I think I actually just need to

21
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,565
Speaker 2:  get rid of it because I don't play it enough or well enough for it to feel

22
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:18,485
Speaker 2:  honest to have a guitar in the shot. I already put some books up that I think

23
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:21,485
Speaker 2:  look nicer than the mugs that were there. The mugs are now up there. There's

24
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:25,345
Speaker 2:  just a lot going on. Will I eventually put some like cool purple lights

25
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:28,925
Speaker 2:  and go full YouTuber? Probably it's gonna happen. I'm excited about it. If

26
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:32,635
Speaker 2:  you have ideas for my home studio, please hit me up, ideally if they don't

27
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:36,265
Speaker 2:  cost a million dollars and won't make my wife very angry.

28
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:38,885
Speaker 2:  Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up for you today. We're doing something

29
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:42,745
Speaker 2:  a little different on the show today, will Pour. Our producer

30
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:46,585
Speaker 2:  got very interested in what I would call an alternate future

31
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:50,405
Speaker 2:  for transportation. Right now we're in the middle of this incredible

32
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:54,205
Speaker 2:  revolution in EVs. We're rethinking the way that charging networks work.

33
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:57,045
Speaker 2:  They're being built out all over the place. There's huge money being put

34
00:01:57,045 --> 00:02:01,005
Speaker 2:  into it. Lots of companies, every car company is suddenly in on what

35
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:04,405
Speaker 2:  if the future of cars is batteries? But that's not the only future that we

36
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:07,365
Speaker 2:  could have had. And in fact, there was a minute where it looked like that

37
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:11,225
Speaker 2:  wasn't gonna be the future that we did have. So Will

38
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:14,725
Speaker 2:  and a couple of other folks on our team went out to California and went on

39
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:18,285
Speaker 2:  a road trip to see what that future might have looked like and what we

40
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:21,995
Speaker 2:  missed. All that is coming up in just a sec, but first, I have to

41
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:25,245
Speaker 2:  move this stuff behind me because now I notice all the clutter and I hate

42
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,445
Speaker 2:  it and I gotta fix it. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right

43
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,325
Speaker 2:  back.

44
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:51,295
Speaker 4:  was 2004 years before Tesla got everyone

45
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:54,915
Speaker 4:  jazzed about battery powered electric cars. Batteries were

46
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:57,725
Speaker 4:  promising, but another technology was farther

47
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:01,595
Speaker 4:  along. Hydrogen fuel cells could power an

48
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:05,435
Speaker 4:  electric motor using only hydrogen gas. The cars

49
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:08,085
Speaker 4:  produced no emissions or byproducts except pure

50
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:12,035
Speaker 4:  water. Governor Schwarzenegger got very excited about

51
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:15,895
Speaker 4:  fuel cells and he proposed an elaborate hydrogen highway

52
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:19,595
Speaker 4:  to support them. The government would help fund a network of fuel

53
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:23,345
Speaker 4:  stations which would encourage automakers to build cars.

54
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:27,155
Speaker 4:  More cars would lead to more stations and by 2010 the

55
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:31,115
Speaker 4:  plan went every Californian would have access to hydrogen

56
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:34,705
Speaker 4:  fuel. From there, advocates predicted a nationwide

57
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:38,575
Speaker 4:  expansion. It could spell the end of the petroleum era

58
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:42,505
Speaker 4:  in America.

59
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:45,015
Speaker 4:  That is not what happened.

60
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:47,975
Speaker 6:  San Jose Snell Avenue under maintenance.

61
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:49,125
Speaker 4:  Oh, offline.

62
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,995
Speaker 6:  Since this morning at 10 50. Oh geez. Okay. The station is

63
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:56,295
Speaker 6:  offline for repair.

64
00:05:56,295 --> 00:06:00,265
Speaker 4:  20 years later, I found myself driving across California

65
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:03,735
Speaker 4:  in a fuel cell car. A Toyota Marai. Rolling

66
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:07,295
Speaker 4:  again. I was there to find out what became of that

67
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:11,285
Speaker 4:  grand green vision of the future. We are 23 minutes away

68
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:14,805
Speaker 4:  from the closest station. Today there are hydrogen

69
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:18,685
Speaker 4:  powered cars You can buy in California and some stations to fill

70
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:22,085
Speaker 4:  them up at. But the statewide network never

71
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:25,325
Speaker 4:  materialized, let alone a national one. And those

72
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:27,015
Speaker 4:  stations are failing.

73
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:31,005
Speaker 7:  Maybe one pump worked for months at a time. Sometimes none of 'em

74
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:31,465
Speaker 7:  worked.

75
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:35,365
Speaker 4:  The cost of fuel is skyrocketing. $36

76
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:36,725
Speaker 8:  A kilos and it's

77
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:39,745
Speaker 4:  Insane. And car sales are plummeting.

78
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:42,065
Speaker 9:  I'm trying to take it back to Toyota.

79
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:45,165
Speaker 4:  The hydrogen experiment is teetering on the

80
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:48,915
Speaker 4:  brink Right now. The auto industry is making this

81
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:52,525
Speaker 4:  huge seismic shift to battery powered

82
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:56,485
Speaker 4:  cars. Why not hydrogen? Why didn't that version of

83
00:06:56,485 --> 00:07:00,425
Speaker 4:  history win out? Who's still fighting for hydrogen today

84
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:04,085
Speaker 4:  and what's happening to the thousands of drivers still sticking it out with

85
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:07,675
Speaker 4:  their cars? This all felt like a lot of questions that

86
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:11,565
Speaker 4:  only a road trip could answer. So in June I roped in

87
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:15,515
Speaker 4:  fellow producer Andrew and our video director Alex. The three of us

88
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:19,445
Speaker 4:  flew to San Francisco, rented a marai on Touro and

89
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:23,095
Speaker 4:  charted a course from the Bay Area to Los Angeles

90
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:25,245
Speaker 4:  along whatever was left of the hydrogen

91
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:29,185
Speaker 4:  highway here to here.

92
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:33,025
Speaker 4:  We are going there.

93
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:46,945
Speaker 1:  Yep.

94
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:50,745
Speaker 4:  We picked up our marai in the parking lot of a mini golf course outside

95
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:54,275
Speaker 4:  San Jose, just south of San Francisco.

96
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:58,115
Speaker 4:  It's a very ordinary looking sedan. If it weren't for the little

97
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:01,525
Speaker 4:  fuel cell badge on the back, you wouldn't know there was anything unusual

98
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:03,875
Speaker 4:  about it.

99
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,975
Speaker 1:  Whoa.

100
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:09,525
Speaker 4:  Under the hood, a marai and a Tesla are surprisingly

101
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:13,235
Speaker 4:  similar. They're both powered by electric motors and a fuel

102
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:16,885
Speaker 4:  cell is basically a battery just instead of pumping

103
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:20,605
Speaker 4:  in electricity to store and use later you're pumping in

104
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:24,105
Speaker 4:  hydrogen to react with oxygen and generate electricity on the

105
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:28,005
Speaker 4:  fly. In other words, a Mariah's hydrogen tank and a

106
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:31,845
Speaker 4:  Tesla's battery are just two different ways of storing energy until

107
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,765
Speaker 4:  it's needed to power the car. Oh, there's one other difference. The fuel

108
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,455
Speaker 4:  cell creates a decent amount of water as a byproduct. In the

109
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:43,215
Speaker 4:  Mariah, it's almost a cup per mile traveled. So the car does need

110
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:44,275
Speaker 4:  to

111
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:50,755
Speaker 4:  pee.

112
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:54,535
Speaker 4:  As the Mariah drives it occasionally shoots water out a little hole

113
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:58,165
Speaker 4:  underneath the car. You can also make it pee on command by

114
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:00,235
Speaker 4:  hitting a button on the dashboard.

115
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:04,105
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Go ahead and start the car. The remote is in the middle.

116
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:05,245
Speaker 11:  You side the

117
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,685
Speaker 4:  Remote. The guy we rented from Salman gave us a quick tour of the

118
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:09,565
Speaker 4:  car

119
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:13,085
Speaker 11:  And it's a luxury car. It drives beautiful actually, once you drive this

120
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,385
Speaker 11:  you'll feel it.

121
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:18,085
Speaker 4:  The Mariah has a classy interior and a flashy nav system with a

122
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:21,965
Speaker 4:  gazillion cameras. The only oddity is this hump in the back row

123
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:25,945
Speaker 4:  of seats. The main hydrogen tank sits underneath it. It makes sitting

124
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:29,545
Speaker 4:  in the middle kind of awkward. Alman told us we'd love the

125
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:32,515
Speaker 4:  car, but he wasn't sure about our travel plans.

126
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:35,685
Speaker 11:  Yeah. When I came to know you were in LA I was like, wait a second. I was

127
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:38,425
Speaker 11:  a little uncomfortable.

128
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:42,165
Speaker 4:  The problem is most of the fuel stations in California are

129
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:46,125
Speaker 4:  clustered around the Bay Area and Los Angeles. There's just one

130
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,655
Speaker 4:  pump on Interstate five in between. It's at a place called Harris

131
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,405
Speaker 4:  Ranch. We kind of need to refuel there. The drive

132
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:57,055
Speaker 4:  to LA is about 325 miles, which is

133
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,635
Speaker 4:  right at the max range of this car. But we also

134
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:04,435
Speaker 4:  need luck because apparently hydrogen stations

135
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,685
Speaker 4:  just don't work. Sometimes there's

136
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:10,445
Speaker 11:  Always a credit card issue. Sometimes the card system is down, sometimes

137
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:14,095
Speaker 11:  the pump itself is down. Sometimes there is not enough hydrogen,

138
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:18,065
Speaker 4:  Which makes our stop at Harris Ranch. Very high stakes.

139
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:21,625
Speaker 11:  If that pump is down Yeah. Then you know you're stuck.

140
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,245
Speaker 4:  You've never driven down to No, not

141
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:25,945
Speaker 11:  Yet. Yeah, I didn't wanna take a chance yet.

142
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:29,525
Speaker 4:  Not exactly a pep talk. Pep. Oh and there was one other

143
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:32,365
Speaker 4:  FYI, the price of hydrogen two

144
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:36,355
Speaker 11:  Years ago. It used to cost like 50 or $60 to fill the whole whole tank.

145
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:40,245
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Right now it's like 180, 190 to fill the tanks. Yeah. So

146
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:42,085
Speaker 11:  that is killing everybody right now.

147
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:45,525
Speaker 4:  $180 to fill up a sedan. Yeah. I don't think we

148
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,805
Speaker 4:  budgeted enough money for the fuel for

149
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:50,645
Speaker 11:  This trip. Yeah, so, so that's what I got disappointed. I said, you know

150
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:54,205
Speaker 11:  what, I'll just put on Turo. Yeah. And live with it like that.

151
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:57,575
Speaker 4:  And with that there was nothing left to do but hit the road

152
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:00,945
Speaker 4:  excited and suddenly very nervous. Turn

153
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:03,075
Speaker 12:  Right then your destination will be on the left.

154
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:06,865
Speaker 4:  Thank you Siri. Our first goal was to visit as many fuel

155
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:10,585
Speaker 4:  stations as we could find in the Bay Area. On paper there are

156
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:14,265
Speaker 4:  about 17, but according to the station finder apps we

157
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:17,785
Speaker 4:  downloaded, lots of them were offline or under some kind of

158
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:21,105
Speaker 4:  maintenance. Alright, we're coming up on it. I never know. You never know

159
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:24,645
Speaker 4:  what kind of gas station it's gonna be. Almost all the stations here

160
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:28,425
Speaker 4:  are operated by a startup called First Element Fuel, but they're

161
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:32,115
Speaker 4:  co-located at Chevron or Shell or other gas stations.

162
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:35,965
Speaker 4:  First element leases the space from station owners, the Shell station,

163
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:39,695
Speaker 4:  the pumps themselves are bright blue with these eye catching awnings.

164
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:43,465
Speaker 4:  Some of them are slotted right in between gas pumps. Others are set

165
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:45,535
Speaker 4:  apart in their own little pads and parking

166
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,785
Speaker 4:  lots. Well let's try to figure this

167
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:52,545
Speaker 4:  out. The mechanics of filling up a hydrogen

168
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,435
Speaker 4:  tank are familiar enough. Insert a credit card, select

169
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:59,525
Speaker 4:  fuel connect pump to car, hang out for five

170
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:03,325
Speaker 4:  minutes. But unlike gasoline, these pumps are moving

171
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:07,255
Speaker 4:  around a compressed freezing cold gas. So there are

172
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:10,945
Speaker 4:  locks and sensors to keep everything safe and reliable. The

173
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:14,725
Speaker 4:  nozzle is a heavy metal cylinder with a collar that keeps the

174
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:18,325
Speaker 4:  hose in place. It's all a bit of a learning curve. It

175
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:22,125
Speaker 4:  says hide the yellow mark. I don't see a

176
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:26,045
Speaker 4:  yellow mark, but I think pulling this sleeve down locks

177
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,845
Speaker 4:  it. So we just push it in and

178
00:12:29,845 --> 00:12:32,735
Speaker 4:  then lock it. Oh,

179
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:33,285
Speaker 13:  There we go.

180
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:37,205
Speaker 4:  Just a yellow. Okay, we're filling up. We tried

181
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:40,835
Speaker 4:  fueling at most of the stations we visited and we always got

182
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:44,405
Speaker 4:  fuel, but we hit a glit or two in just about every part of the

183
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:47,695
Speaker 4:  process. The screens are both wigging out a little bit, but it

184
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:51,685
Speaker 4:  seems like it's fine. I

185
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:55,615
Speaker 4:  don't know what door sensor means, but, oh I think it

186
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:59,585
Speaker 4:  timed out or something. I gotta run my cart again.

187
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:03,565
Speaker 4:  One constant struggle. The nozzle kept sticking to the car after we were

188
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:07,525
Speaker 4:  done filling. I hate that.

189
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,885
Speaker 4:  I hate yanking that hard on

190
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:13,085
Speaker 4:  anything. But that was just our

191
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:16,715
Speaker 4:  experience. We also talked with every Mirage driver. We ran

192
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:20,525
Speaker 4:  into, Hey, excuse me. Do you have time while you feel to

193
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:24,275
Speaker 4:  to chat with us for our, for our story and their stories

194
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,845
Speaker 4:  Were more extreme.

195
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:29,105
Speaker 14:  These are third stage station we are right now. We came

196
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:30,755
Speaker 4:  Oh, you you tried to go to two others.

197
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:33,885
Speaker 14:  Yeah, there's one station in Sunnyvale, one in San Jose. This is one in

198
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:36,365
Speaker 14:  Cupertino. Half of the time these don't work here. Yeah.

199
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:36,865
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

200
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:39,365
Speaker 13:  So they're either out of gas or That's the problem with

201
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:42,565
Speaker 14:  The machine. And even sometimes it shows you to insert card. When you insert

202
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:45,645
Speaker 14:  the card it's says transaction canceled and it doesn't give you anything

203
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:45,905
Speaker 14:  out.

204
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:46,965
Speaker 4:  It just doesn't work and then you

205
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,555
Speaker 14:  Just, it just doesn't work.

206
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:52,455
Speaker 4:  Mead and Rupesh have been driving their Mirai for about four months,

207
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:55,645
Speaker 4:  which for them has been a nonstop hunt for working

208
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:59,605
Speaker 4:  stations. I had no idea just how frequently they run out

209
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,335
Speaker 4:  of fuel or glitch or lose pressure and can't fill

210
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:04,725
Speaker 4:  tanks completely. And

211
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:08,525
Speaker 13:  It's always a pressure on you mentally because you never know which

212
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:11,115
Speaker 13:  one's gonna work, which one's not gonna work.

213
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:14,885
Speaker 4:  Fuel has been so hard to find that these guys have been stretching

214
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:18,635
Speaker 4:  every kilogram. That's how hydrogen is measured. When they drive,

215
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:22,205
Speaker 4:  they accelerate and break carefully. They avoid air

216
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:26,185
Speaker 4:  conditioning because it uses more fuel and when the car says it still

217
00:14:26,185 --> 00:14:30,105
Speaker 4:  has a hundred miles left in the tank, they look for a station. Yeah.

218
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:33,725
Speaker 4:  Boy. So you have to really think about how you're driving the car.

219
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:36,315
Speaker 14:  Yeah. You have to focus on the road and also on the, on your mileage here.

220
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:37,755
Speaker 14:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

221
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:41,655
Speaker 4:  Manatee bought the car because of a huge incentive from Toyota.

222
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:44,925
Speaker 4:  Every new or certified used Mariah comes with a

223
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,675
Speaker 4:  $15,000 preloaded fuel card. Toyota

224
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:52,665
Speaker 4:  told us it's there to absorb any volatility in fuel prices

225
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:55,345
Speaker 4:  and that's not the only big promotion out there.

226
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:59,325
Speaker 15:  So this car I got for 15,000 hard to

227
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:00,755
Speaker 15:  beat, right? Yeah.

228
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:04,725
Speaker 4:  Rebecca said she went shopping for a battery electric car but she couldn't

229
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:08,565
Speaker 4:  find anything for less than $40,000. But then a Toyota

230
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:12,215
Speaker 4:  dealership offered her that killer deal on a 2022

231
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:16,125
Speaker 4:  marai with only 23,000 miles on it. Toyota's also been

232
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,965
Speaker 4:  offering big discounts on Nu Maiz earlier this year. You

233
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:23,565
Speaker 4:  could get $40,000 off some models. That's a

234
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:25,165
Speaker 4:  60% discount. That's

235
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:29,085
Speaker 15:  It. I'm paying a fortune in hydrogen but it'll take something

236
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,925
Speaker 15:  like 13 years. I did my math. Okay. It'll

237
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:36,715
Speaker 15:  take 13 years before this vehicle will

238
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:39,845
Speaker 15:  cost me more than if I were to buy a 40,000

239
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:41,835
Speaker 15:  something electric vehicle. Yeah.

240
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:45,785
Speaker 4:  Rebecca loves her. Mariah, so she's content for now.

241
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:49,605
Speaker 15:  I'm gonna stick with my marai as long as I'm in

242
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:51,195
Speaker 15:  California.

243
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:53,725
Speaker 4:  Mandeep and Rupesh, not so much

244
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:57,235
Speaker 14:  I don't think. To be very honest with you. After the gas cutt is finished,

245
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:59,415
Speaker 14:  it's not worth maintaining This car.

246
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:03,235
Speaker 4:  Manad left us with some words of caution about our trip, which

247
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:07,105
Speaker 4:  believe me, we took to heart when we said goodbye to the bay

248
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:11,085
Speaker 4:  and headed south for Los Angeles. No ac go easy on the

249
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:14,795
Speaker 4:  pedal. Yeah. Always know where the next station is. Yeah.

250
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:15,285
Speaker 4:  Call the

251
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:16,615
Speaker 14:  Stations close to the speed limit.

252
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:18,025
Speaker 4:  Stick to the speed limit

253
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:21,355
Speaker 14:  If possible, go below the speed limit. Try to be in the right most

254
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,275
Speaker 14:  lane.

255
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:26,005
Speaker 4:  This is not the the road trip that we were looking forward to

256
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:27,075
Speaker 4:  having. You know,

257
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:29,605
Speaker 14:  Road trip. I'm really sorry for a spoiling year. Road

258
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:33,385
Speaker 14:  trip.

259
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:37,365
Speaker 4:  We can start with the windows down. Windows down also, how fast do you

260
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:41,345
Speaker 4:  think I should drive? We should play with the settings on the car to see.

261
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:42,885
Speaker 4:  It tells you how efficiently you're

262
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:46,385
Speaker 4:  driving on the road to

263
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:50,265
Speaker 4:  la I had a lot of downtime to think about everything I'd seen

264
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:53,725
Speaker 4:  and most of my questions boiled down to how did we get

265
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:57,565
Speaker 4:  here, which You can think about in two ways. There's the big broad

266
00:16:57,565 --> 00:17:01,225
Speaker 4:  version. How did hydrogen cars start out so promising

267
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:04,725
Speaker 4:  but stumble so badly. And then there's the more

268
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:07,245
Speaker 4:  specific, why is it so hard to get fuel for your

269
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:10,925
Speaker 4:  car? So as we cruise down I

270
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:14,885
Speaker 4:  five, let's start with the big, how did we get here for that? I

271
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:18,525
Speaker 4:  called up Keith Wike. He's an industry veteran from the National Renewable

272
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:19,785
Speaker 4:  Energy Lab.

273
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:23,425
Speaker 16:  You did come to the right person. I've been involved in hydrogen technologies

274
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:25,375
Speaker 16:  for over 20 years.

275
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,135
Speaker 4:  Keith took me all the way back to 2004. Again, back then

276
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:32,945
Speaker 4:  fewer people were talking about climate change the way we all are today.

277
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:35,795
Speaker 4:  But California had a smog problem.

278
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:39,055
Speaker 16:  They had the the worst air quality, especially in the Los Angeles

279
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:42,845
Speaker 16:  basin. And so they had a, a strong driver to clean up local air

280
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:43,555
Speaker 16:  quality

281
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:47,305
Speaker 4:  Battery electric cars existed but they were not the obvious

282
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:51,105
Speaker 4:  air apparent to gasoline. In fact, as a storage medium

283
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:54,645
Speaker 4:  to power a car, batteries kind of sucked.

284
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:58,625
Speaker 16:  Batteries were not good at the time. It was lead acid batteries and

285
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,245
Speaker 16:  nickel metal hydride was the up and coming thing, which of course is what

286
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:05,875
Speaker 16:  Toyota launched their Prius hybrid with, with nickel metal hydride batteries.

287
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:09,455
Speaker 16:  That was a challenge for batteries at the time. 80, 90 mile

288
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,265
Speaker 16:  range. A very heavy, a lot of compromises on the vehicle itself

289
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:16,945
Speaker 16:  to get reasonable performance. So hydrogen kind of

290
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:20,795
Speaker 16:  was being born into that era.

291
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:24,645
Speaker 4:  Meanwhile, hydrogen was showing a lot of promise. You could get

292
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,205
Speaker 4:  all the emissions benefits of a battery electric car without the

293
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:31,725
Speaker 4:  battery. Plus fueling was a faster and more familiar

294
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:35,325
Speaker 4:  process for drivers. It looked like a great successor to

295
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:38,585
Speaker 4:  gasoline and California got on board.

296
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:42,565
Speaker 5:  I'm going to encourage the building of a hydrogen highway to take us to the

297
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:45,705
Speaker 5:  environmental future.

298
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:49,405
Speaker 4:  The original plan called for at least 150 stations by

299
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:53,125
Speaker 4:  2010, but that never happened. Around 10 demo

300
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,485
Speaker 4:  stations came and went, which were co-funded by a federal

301
00:18:56,485 --> 00:19:00,165
Speaker 4:  program. Everyone learned a lot, but it was an r and d

302
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:03,605
Speaker 4:  exercise by the end of the decade. Lots of people were

303
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:07,215
Speaker 4:  asking, where is this hydrogen highway?

304
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:10,875
Speaker 4:  But in 2013 California reset and

305
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,855
Speaker 4:  recommitted, it put up $20 million a year for stations

306
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:18,515
Speaker 4:  and between 2015 and 2020, at least 37 new

307
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:20,475
Speaker 4:  stations came online.

308
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:24,395
Speaker 16:  I do think that I and a lot of other people thought it was just

309
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:28,275
Speaker 16:  gonna be a bunch of dominoes falling, that the hydrogen stations were gonna

310
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:31,875
Speaker 16:  go 50, a hundred, 200 stations in California. The

311
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,815
Speaker 16:  northeast market would launch and take off there and then people like

312
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:39,505
Speaker 16:  me in Colorado would maybe get a backbone across

313
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:43,375
Speaker 16:  interstates and we would be able to drive a hydrogen car

314
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,495
Speaker 16:  as part of our daily commute.

315
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:49,325
Speaker 4:  The car companies played their part too. In 2008, Honda

316
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:53,025
Speaker 4:  began leasing a fuel cell sedan called the Clarity. Toyota

317
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,365
Speaker 4:  made a big splash with the Mariah in 2015. This

318
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:59,915
Speaker 17:  Isn't just another car, this is an

319
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:03,735
Speaker 17:  opportunity to really make a difference.

320
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,715
Speaker 17:  The name we've given to our new car is midlife, which

321
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:10,775
Speaker 17:  in Japanese means future.

322
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:14,575
Speaker 4:  The other fuel cell car You can buy today. The Hyundai NEXO hit the

323
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:16,455
Speaker 4:  US in 2018.

324
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:20,375
Speaker 16:  So I've seen and witnessed various launches and and for me each

325
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:24,315
Speaker 16:  one of them felt like, okay this is it now we just need

326
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:28,195
Speaker 16:  more of that car, we need more fueling stations. And then we see the

327
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:31,955
Speaker 16:  other companies launch. Okay, that's further validation that this is going

328
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:32,315
Speaker 16:  in the right

329
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:36,535
Speaker 16:  direction.

330
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,525
Speaker 4:  The fuel cell market has come a long way in 20

331
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:43,475
Speaker 4:  years, but along the way something else

332
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,195
Speaker 4:  happened too. Batteries got good, good enough to power

333
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:51,005
Speaker 4:  cars and in the race to replace gasoline,

334
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:54,645
Speaker 4:  batteries had some big advantages over hydrogen. I called up the

335
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:58,515
Speaker 4:  verges transportation editor Andy Hawkins to explain. And he started

336
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:01,875
Speaker 4:  with the fact that we already have a power grid

337
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,155
Speaker 18:  With EV charging, it's pretty simple. You install the charging

338
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:09,085
Speaker 18:  station, you plug it into the grid and barring any software

339
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:12,315
Speaker 18:  problems or anything else like that, it's good to go. It should work.

340
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:16,215
Speaker 4:  That was a huge advantage in the early days of battery EVs. Drivers

341
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:17,995
Speaker 4:  could just plug in at home.

342
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:21,425
Speaker 18:  It's a different story with hydrogen. There needs to be a supply chain.

343
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:25,245
Speaker 18:  You need to truck the hydrogen in for where it's being produced to the filling

344
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:29,145
Speaker 18:  stations fill up those tanks at the filling stations and then once

345
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:33,005
Speaker 18:  the hydrogen has been depleted, the whole process starts all over

346
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:33,945
Speaker 18:  again.

347
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:37,865
Speaker 4:  Now granted it's taken years for a public EV charging network

348
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:41,305
Speaker 4:  to mature. In fact, it's been a mess of competing standards

349
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:44,565
Speaker 4:  and flaky charging ports, but it's getting

350
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:48,205
Speaker 4:  better. And the reason reveals another huge

351
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:51,025
Speaker 4:  difference between hydrogen and batteries.

352
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:54,885
Speaker 18:  The hydrogen car industry as it were, didn't have a

353
00:21:54,885 --> 00:21:56,165
Speaker 18:  Tesla. Ladies and

354
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:57,365
Speaker 19:  Gentlemen, Mr. Elon

355
00:21:57,365 --> 00:22:00,855
Speaker 19:  Musk

356
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:04,765
Speaker 4:  Tesla hit the scene in 2008 with the a hundred thousand dollars

357
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:08,445
Speaker 4:  Roadster and it has utterly defined the battery

358
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:12,045
Speaker 4:  electric business ever since. Over the past 15 years its cars

359
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:16,005
Speaker 4:  have steadily gotten cheaper and more ubiquitous and along the

360
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:19,965
Speaker 4:  way it also built a huge charging network, which

361
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:23,885
Speaker 4:  is so good that pretty much every other automaker in the US is

362
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,855
Speaker 4:  now signing on to Tesla's standard.

363
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:29,365
Speaker 18:  We're getting the entire industry realizing that Tesla has the best charging

364
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:32,565
Speaker 18:  network, they have the best chargers, the most reliable. We're all gonna

365
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:36,285
Speaker 18:  just end up using Tesla's as we probably could have realized a lot

366
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:37,105
Speaker 18:  sooner.

367
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:41,005
Speaker 4:  In other words, say what you will about Elon Musk and on

368
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:44,765
Speaker 4:  this podcast we surely do, but Tesla gets a lot of

369
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:48,735
Speaker 4:  credit for dragging the battery electric market into existence,

370
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,895
Speaker 4:  which is something that hydrogen just never had.

371
00:22:51,895 --> 00:22:55,725
Speaker 18:  There was no Tesla startup company that was out

372
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:59,405
Speaker 18:  there innovating, taking its lumps, losing

373
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:02,735
Speaker 18:  millions and millions of dollars in the process, but also

374
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:05,805
Speaker 18:  generating lots of buzz, generating lots of hype and

375
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:09,685
Speaker 18:  speculation amongst investors and on Wall Street in the

376
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:13,605
Speaker 18:  government as well. And sort of proving eventually, ultimately that there

377
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:17,445
Speaker 18:  was gonna be this huge untapped market for battery electric

378
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:18,675
Speaker 18:  vehicles.

379
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:22,375
Speaker 4:  In the end, the numbers tell the story. Battery electric

380
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:26,025
Speaker 4:  cars and charging stations exploded across the country.

381
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:29,935
Speaker 4:  Today there are roughly 43,000 public charging ports in

382
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:33,695
Speaker 4:  California alone. Whereas hydrogen seems to be

383
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:34,905
Speaker 4:  backsliding.

384
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:38,655
Speaker 18:  There still is this plan that exists like state grants to

385
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:41,535
Speaker 18:  companies to build out stations. The only problem is the companies that

386
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:45,395
Speaker 18:  have agreed to do so are now backtracking on those plans.

387
00:23:45,395 --> 00:23:49,305
Speaker 18:  Like for example, shell said that it was going to create a huge network

388
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:53,145
Speaker 18:  of hydrogen stations in the state, but then they saw sort of like the writing

389
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:56,965
Speaker 18:  on the wall and decided to start backing outta that

390
00:23:56,965 --> 00:24:00,725
Speaker 18:  plan. They declined a $40 million state grant to build like an extra

391
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:04,685
Speaker 18:  50 stations and then they went ahead and just closed practically all

392
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:06,385
Speaker 18:  of their stations in California.

393
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:10,005
Speaker 4:  Gotcha. So basically there's money out there and there just aren't takers

394
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:11,115
Speaker 4:  for it right now

395
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:15,085
Speaker 18:  There's a pretty strong belief right now in sort

396
00:24:15,085 --> 00:24:18,185
Speaker 18:  of in, in California and elsewhere that battery electric vehicles, they

397
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:21,845
Speaker 18:  won hydrogen could have, you know, surpassed EVs at some

398
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:25,635
Speaker 18:  point. But over the last like 15 or 20 years, it's very clear

399
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:28,895
Speaker 18:  that battery electric vehicles are, are the preferred alternate

400
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:32,765
Speaker 18:  technology for private vehicles. And hydrogen is kind of

401
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:33,765
Speaker 18:  becoming a bit of a

402
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,745
Speaker 18:  footnote.

403
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:41,555
Speaker 4:  So there's the big picture, how do we get here? But

404
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:45,125
Speaker 4:  that doesn't fully explain what we saw. Glitchy

405
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:49,045
Speaker 4:  stations, the price of fuel, the shortages. To understand those

406
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:52,905
Speaker 4:  problems, I needed to talk to first element, the company that runs

407
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:56,645
Speaker 4:  almost three quarters of the stations in California. So I called up one of

408
00:24:56,645 --> 00:25:00,125
Speaker 4:  the co-founders, Shane Stevens, who was pretty candid with

409
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,535
Speaker 4:  me.

410
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:05,485
Speaker 21:  We've been doing some, I would say field testing on customers to

411
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:08,665
Speaker 21:  get this equipment kind of commercial ready to where it needs to be. Right.

412
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:12,485
Speaker 21:  And it's, you know, we didn't mean to do that right? But we've sort of we're

413
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:15,945
Speaker 21:  forced into that situation because as we started operating these stations,

414
00:25:15,945 --> 00:25:19,465
Speaker 21:  we just uncorked all sorts of issues that needed to be addressed.

415
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:23,005
Speaker 4:  Here's what happened back in 2013, the year California

416
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:26,845
Speaker 4:  announced new funding for hydrogen stations. Shane was working at

417
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:30,725
Speaker 4:  the National Fuel Cell Research Center at uc, Irvine. He watched the

418
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:34,675
Speaker 4:  wave of interest and hydrogen build again and he saw an opportunity on the

419
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:38,285
Speaker 4:  fueling side of things. So that same year he and two

420
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:40,315
Speaker 4:  partners founded First element.

421
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:44,145
Speaker 21:  From there we actually got some initial financing from Toyota

422
00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:48,085
Speaker 21:  and Honda and we were able to leverage that private financing and go get

423
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:51,805
Speaker 21:  California state grants. We won 19 stations and we were able to

424
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:55,295
Speaker 21:  develop the initial network of hydrogen stations.

425
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:59,275
Speaker 4:  First element made a big push right out of the gates and it got around

426
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:03,175
Speaker 4:  15 stations up and running. By the end of 2016, that

427
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:07,155
Speaker 4:  speed was a calculated risk. They built more smaller,

428
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:10,945
Speaker 4:  cheaper stations to prove out the network and encourage automakers

429
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:14,885
Speaker 4:  to start selling cars. And the plan worked a

430
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:16,065
Speaker 4:  little too well.

431
00:26:16,065 --> 00:26:19,565
Speaker 21:  The cars came more quickly, the stations were overwhelmed more quickly and

432
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:23,395
Speaker 21:  the customers drove the cars more than we anticipated Early on.

433
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:27,065
Speaker 21:  What became obvious to us is that this technology for hydrogen stations

434
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:30,635
Speaker 21:  was actually not really ready for prime time commercially. The

435
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:34,365
Speaker 21:  equipment that we're using in the field today, it hasn't gone

436
00:26:34,365 --> 00:26:38,245
Speaker 21:  through sort of hours of testing to make sure the robustness is there to

437
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:42,105
Speaker 21:  make sure that you know, little design kinks or design flaws have been worked

438
00:26:42,105 --> 00:26:46,025
Speaker 21:  out. And then when it's used, you know, regularly every day

439
00:26:46,025 --> 00:26:49,885
Speaker 21:  on hundreds of customers, all of a sudden you start to see that it, it maybe

440
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:53,335
Speaker 21:  doesn't hold up as well because it's never been tested under those conditions.

441
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:57,205
Speaker 4:  Which lines up with our experience at the pumps, lots of little quirks and

442
00:26:57,205 --> 00:26:58,225
Speaker 4:  rough edges.

443
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:01,765
Speaker 21:  We had a lot of hiccups on uptime, we had performance

444
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:05,605
Speaker 21:  issues, we had logistics issues on supplying the fuel and we actually had

445
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:07,855
Speaker 21:  a lot of fuel run outs to the station.

446
00:27:07,855 --> 00:27:11,845
Speaker 4:  First element has spent years trying to fix that first big

447
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:15,785
Speaker 4:  mistake. It's newer stations are bigger, more expensive and more

448
00:27:15,785 --> 00:27:19,365
Speaker 4:  robust. They can store more fuel and dispense more at a

449
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:23,005
Speaker 4:  time. They actually store hydrogen as a liquid now rather than a

450
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:25,465
Speaker 4:  gas, which has been a lot easier.

451
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:28,685
Speaker 21:  And you know, the reliability is getting much better than what it was as

452
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:32,165
Speaker 21:  well. I don't think we're all the way where, where we we could

453
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:35,685
Speaker 21:  be, but we're now at a point where we see a a commercially viable

454
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:36,635
Speaker 21:  product

455
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:40,605
Speaker 4:  That also attracts with what we saw. We just had fewer hiccups using the

456
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:44,385
Speaker 4:  newer stations and drivers told us they were more reliable.

457
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:47,965
Speaker 4:  But those older flimsier stations are still

458
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:51,805
Speaker 4:  there. They account for nearly half the overall network and

459
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:53,215
Speaker 4:  they're not going anywhere.

460
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,805
Speaker 21:  We've invested quite a bit of money into permanent infrastructure

461
00:27:56,805 --> 00:28:00,365
Speaker 21:  that's in the ground to upgrade the station is not really an

462
00:28:00,365 --> 00:28:04,355
Speaker 21:  option. And the other thing is we don't wanna leave customers hanging

463
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:08,065
Speaker 21:  that may be depending on that station, even if it's an older generation.

464
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:11,865
Speaker 4:  So drivers are stuck with temperamental hardware and first element

465
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:13,505
Speaker 4:  is stuck maintaining it.

466
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:17,245
Speaker 21:  So right now we're charging, you know, considerably more for hydrogen than

467
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:19,865
Speaker 21:  what we'd like to be and what we think we should be.

468
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,645
Speaker 4:  And that's not the only cause of expensive fuel first element. And

469
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:27,485
Speaker 4:  others have had a hard time competing for hydrogen against much bigger

470
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:31,445
Speaker 4:  industries like oil refining and agriculture. There just isn't enough

471
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:35,245
Speaker 4:  to go around. There have also been supply chain problems and

472
00:28:35,245 --> 00:28:38,565
Speaker 4:  other market issues. The war in Ukraine is even playing a

473
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:42,085
Speaker 4:  role. So prices have been spiking and not

474
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,585
Speaker 4:  enough. Hydrogen is making it to drivers.

475
00:28:44,585 --> 00:28:48,135
Speaker 21:  But unfortunately that's the, the reality of the landscape today.

476
00:28:48,135 --> 00:28:51,295
Speaker 4:  First element is now staring down the barrel of a vicious

477
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:55,245
Speaker 4:  cycle. The more the fuel network struggles, the less viable the

478
00:28:55,245 --> 00:28:59,185
Speaker 4:  cars look. It's the exact opposite of what they were trying to do

479
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:02,505
Speaker 4:  by opening all those stations in the first place. Our transportation

480
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,675
Speaker 4:  editor, Andy said it best.

481
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:08,405
Speaker 18:  Yeah, I mean it's kind of like enmeshed in like the worst chicken and egg

482
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:12,165
Speaker 18:  scenario that you could possibly imagine. You know, like people aren't going

483
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:15,685
Speaker 18:  to buy hydrogen cars 'cause there's just, there's no way to fuel them,

484
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:19,365
Speaker 18:  right? And then you're not gonna have anyone building any fueling

485
00:29:19,365 --> 00:29:22,805
Speaker 18:  stations because so few people own the hydrogen cars. So

486
00:34:03,445 --> 00:34:06,325
Speaker 6:  warning until eight o'clock tonight.

487
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:09,775
Speaker 4:  A few more miles of nothing and then an exit sign.

488
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:11,625
Speaker 6:  There it is.

489
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:14,405
Speaker 4:  You see it? Oh, Harris Ranch. All

490
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:18,125
Speaker 4:  right. Harris Ranch is perfectly spaced

491
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:22,085
Speaker 4:  between San Francisco and la so it's a way point for all

492
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:25,925
Speaker 4:  kinds of drivers. There's a Shell gas station and what

493
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:29,135
Speaker 4:  is currently the largest bank of Tesla superchargers in the

494
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:32,955
Speaker 4:  world. Over the years though the owners of Harris Ranch

495
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:36,875
Speaker 4:  have made it a destination unto itself. They've built a massive

496
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:40,525
Speaker 4:  Spanish hacienda style hotel, multiple

497
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:44,125
Speaker 4:  restaurants, and the only gift shop I've ever seen with a butcher

498
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:48,025
Speaker 4:  counter. All right, there's the shell station. We drive past

499
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:52,005
Speaker 4:  all of this past palm trees, past a barbecue pit

500
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:55,365
Speaker 4:  slash convenience store, past an under construction RV

501
00:34:55,365 --> 00:34:59,205
Speaker 4:  park. And there off on a lonely plot of

502
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:03,165
Speaker 4:  concrete is one first element hydrogen pump. This

503
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:05,685
Speaker 4:  is a very weird place. There's

504
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,635
Speaker 6:  A couple flies in the car.

505
00:35:08,635 --> 00:35:11,005
Speaker 4:  Well, should we gas up? Let's do

506
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:14,465
Speaker 4:  it. We pull up to the pump, get

507
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:17,505
Speaker 4:  out and my god, the heat.

508
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:21,445
Speaker 4:  Ugh, it just hits you. I better not

509
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:22,215
Speaker 4:  take seven

510
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:26,005
Speaker 4:  tries to get

511
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:29,435
Speaker 4:  Hydrow. The buttons are hot.

512
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:33,425
Speaker 4:  Unfortunately the pump doesn't care how hot we are.

513
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:37,345
Speaker 4:  All right, it's done. That doesn't feel like a a full

514
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:40,705
Speaker 4:  tank's worth, but we'll see when we turn the car back

515
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,465
Speaker 4:  on,

516
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:42,275
Speaker 26:  Please

517
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:46,085
Speaker 4:  Seek attendant. We got fuel. I don't think

518
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:49,885
Speaker 4:  there's an attendant here. I hope I didn't just break it for everybody

519
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:50,805
Speaker 4:  else

520
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:52,275
Speaker 26:  I can. Did you get a full tank?

521
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:52,805
Speaker 4:  Well, let's

522
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:56,745
Speaker 4:  see,

523
00:35:56,745 --> 00:36:00,605
Speaker 4:  236 miles. No, we didn't get a

524
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:04,485
Speaker 4:  full tank. We start the process all over again. This time the

525
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:08,325
Speaker 4:  pin pad freezes, then gives us an input error, but then

526
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:12,055
Speaker 4:  it resets and fuel starts flowing. Dispenser is okay,

527
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:16,045
Speaker 4:  we're getting, we we're getting more hydrogen. We finally get our

528
00:36:16,045 --> 00:36:19,295
Speaker 4:  full tank, but then the nozzle gets stuck to the car.

529
00:36:19,295 --> 00:36:22,675
Speaker 4:  Again. 101 degrees, no shade.

530
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:25,335
Speaker 4:  Dwindling patients. I don't know what I'm doing

531
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:29,395
Speaker 4:  wrong.

532
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:33,245
Speaker 4:  Look, I know I'm harping a lot on these finicky pumps and I know

533
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:37,125
Speaker 4:  normal gas stations don't work perfectly either, but it's

534
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:40,365
Speaker 4:  shocking how much trouble we've had in just a couple days of

535
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:44,085
Speaker 4:  driving and it's not hard to imagine frustrations like

536
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:46,485
Speaker 4:  these dragging down the whole idea of

537
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:49,925
Speaker 4:  hydrogen. Anyway, the nozzle finally comes

538
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:53,755
Speaker 4:  free. We retreat to a picnic table under a tree and

539
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:55,725
Speaker 4:  wait for other fuel cell drivers to show

540
00:36:55,725 --> 00:37:00,265
Speaker 4:  up.

541
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:03,695
Speaker 4:  We wait for an hour, two hours,

542
00:37:32,345 --> 00:37:32,925
Speaker 4:  as dusk

543
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:05,405
Speaker 4:  LA and he is gone up to San Francisco

544
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:19,105
Speaker 4:  la.

545
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:16,865
Speaker 4:  tool to fight climate change.

546
00:42:03,735 --> 00:42:07,725
Speaker 4:  steam methane reforming, which produces carbon dioxide

547
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:11,515
Speaker 4:  emissions. It also depends on a supply chain that tends to leak

548
00:42:11,515 --> 00:42:15,445
Speaker 4:  methane. Those are two gases we're desperately trying to keep out

549
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,315
Speaker 4:  of the atmosphere right now.

550
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:20,915
Speaker 30:  Methane is a greenhouse gas pollutant that is

551
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:24,435
Speaker 30:  even more potent in the short term than carbon

552
00:42:24,435 --> 00:42:28,305
Speaker 30:  dioxide. And so a majority of hydrogen today is,

553
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:30,435
Speaker 30:  is what you call gray hydrogen

554
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:34,305
Speaker 4:  Meaning basically dirty. Now there is such a thing

555
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:37,645
Speaker 4:  as green hydrogen fuel that's clean and climate

556
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:38,345
Speaker 4:  friendly.

557
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:41,375
Speaker 30:  So the way that green hydrogen is made is typically

558
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:45,325
Speaker 30:  using renewable energy to power electrolysis,

559
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:48,545
Speaker 30:  which is splitting water into hydrogen and

560
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:52,525
Speaker 30:  oxygen. Right now, electrolyzers are pretty

561
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:56,485
Speaker 30:  expensive and green hydrogen is, is something like four times the cost of

562
00:42:56,485 --> 00:42:59,885
Speaker 30:  gray hydrogen right now. So costs have to come way

563
00:42:59,885 --> 00:43:00,785
Speaker 30:  down.

564
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:04,695
Speaker 4:  To be fair, lots of power that's used to charge batteries isn't

565
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:08,425
Speaker 4:  green either. About 60% of the electricity in the

566
00:43:08,425 --> 00:43:12,165
Speaker 4:  US comes from gas and coal. And to pull off a clean

567
00:43:12,165 --> 00:43:15,825
Speaker 4:  battery electric future, we're gonna need a lot more green

568
00:43:15,825 --> 00:43:19,765
Speaker 4:  energy and big upgrades to the grid. None of that is going to be

569
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:23,305
Speaker 4:  easy or cheap. But even in an ideal

570
00:43:23,305 --> 00:43:27,165
Speaker 4:  future that's flush with green electricity, hydrogen is

571
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:28,885
Speaker 4:  still less efficient.

572
00:43:28,885 --> 00:43:32,245
Speaker 30:  A passenger vehicle can much more easily plug into the

573
00:43:32,245 --> 00:43:35,925
Speaker 30:  grid and run on a battery that you juice up with

574
00:43:35,925 --> 00:43:39,645
Speaker 30:  renewable energy. So with hydrogen, you're, you're adding another step to

575
00:43:39,645 --> 00:43:43,045
Speaker 30:  that, right? You're basically using renewable

576
00:43:43,045 --> 00:43:46,885
Speaker 30:  electricity to create the hydrogen to then run the

577
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:50,355
Speaker 30:  vehicle. Versus you could also

578
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:54,285
Speaker 30:  just run the vehicle on renewable electricity in the first

579
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:55,065
Speaker 30:  place.

580
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:58,885
Speaker 4:  So if the question is where do we spend the hydrogen we're making, the

581
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:02,875
Speaker 4:  answer might be things that are harder to plug into the power grid.

582
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:06,515
Speaker 30:  There's more hype around it for industrial

583
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:10,155
Speaker 30:  uses, for aviation, for shipping,

584
00:44:10,155 --> 00:44:13,765
Speaker 30:  because it's much harder to get a

585
00:44:13,765 --> 00:44:17,565
Speaker 30:  plane off the ground or to have a ship that is

586
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:21,365
Speaker 30:  battery powered. Passenger vehicles are just so low down on the

587
00:44:21,365 --> 00:44:24,995
Speaker 30:  list.

588
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,405
Speaker 10:  What did it say? Turn right.

589
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:26,645
Speaker 4:  Turn

590
00:44:26,645 --> 00:44:32,655
Speaker 4:  right

591
00:44:32,655 --> 00:44:35,985
Speaker 4:  after another long stretch of highway five we pulled into

592
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:36,705
Speaker 4:  la

593
00:44:36,705 --> 00:44:38,865
Speaker 6:  All right, here's the palm trees

594
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:42,745
Speaker 12:  1000 feet turn right onto San Fernando Mission Boulevard.

595
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:46,605
Speaker 4:  We were excited to check out the scene. There are more fuel cell cars and

596
00:44:46,605 --> 00:44:50,365
Speaker 4:  stations here than anywhere else in the state. But we'd also

597
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:54,225
Speaker 4:  read about a months long hydrogen shortage. And our fuel map

598
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:58,045
Speaker 4:  showed a lot of offline stations. I see it. It's glowing

599
00:44:58,045 --> 00:44:59,155
Speaker 4:  Those blue audiences. Oh,

600
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,445
Speaker 6:  It's nice looking.

601
00:45:00,445 --> 00:45:01,165
Speaker 4:  I are those

602
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,675
Speaker 6:  A little futuristic looking?

603
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:06,325
Speaker 4:  They're a little snazzier. We found lots of fuel cell

604
00:45:06,325 --> 00:45:09,945
Speaker 4:  drivers really quickly and well,

605
00:45:09,945 --> 00:45:11,745
Speaker 4:  here's your vibe. Check.

606
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:15,325
Speaker 7:  Hey, it's been awful. To be completely honest. I'm trying

607
00:45:15,325 --> 00:45:18,625
Speaker 9:  To trade it in for a regular car, like a gasoline car.

608
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:22,525
Speaker 31:  We bought this with the idea of saving the earth or whatever and of

609
00:45:22,525 --> 00:45:26,205
Speaker 31:  course saving for the gas, but never happened. Have

610
00:45:26,205 --> 00:45:29,765
Speaker 4:  You ever run out? Oh, of course. Yeah. Oh yeah. You get towed or I get

611
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:33,565
Speaker 4:  towed. We heard lots of familiar things. Love for the

612
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:37,305
Speaker 4:  cars, frustration around fueling flaky stations,

613
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:41,165
Speaker 4:  brutal prices, range anxiety, regrets. We

614
00:45:41,165 --> 00:45:45,085
Speaker 4:  also saw one Hyundai nexo, the owner tick. Ron

615
00:45:45,085 --> 00:45:48,755
Speaker 4:  actually solved a mystery for us. He told us why fuel nozzles

616
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:50,545
Speaker 4:  kept sticking to our car.

617
00:45:50,545 --> 00:45:53,825
Speaker 7:  So I've been standing here for five minutes trying to yank it off. Yeah.

618
00:45:53,825 --> 00:45:57,805
Speaker 7:  And sometimes it just, okay, like right now is a

619
00:45:57,805 --> 00:46:00,715
Speaker 7:  good example. Okay. This has happened to me. So it gets like really cold.

620
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:02,875
Speaker 7:  Like you could tell there's like ice. Oh,

621
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:06,765
Speaker 4:  Okay. So that's, it is just like, yeah, freezing. It

622
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:10,205
Speaker 4:  turns out that the more the pumps get used, the colder the hardware gets

623
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:14,025
Speaker 4:  from all the cooled hydrogen moving through so the nozzle can freeze

624
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:16,585
Speaker 4:  to the car. Oh wow. It's, yeah, my finger.

625
00:46:16,585 --> 00:46:20,345
Speaker 7:  So that was actually stuck to it. Actually not bad. It took about 10 seconds,

626
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:24,325
Speaker 7:  but other times I've literally sat waited five minutes. Yeah. For it

627
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:26,225
Speaker 7:  to loosen up. But oh,

628
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:29,765
Speaker 4:  We thought we, we were pulling on that handle wrong or something. Yeah. We

629
00:46:29,765 --> 00:46:32,395
Speaker 4:  thought there was some trick that we didn't know and it's, it's the freezing.

630
00:46:32,395 --> 00:46:32,685
Speaker 4:  It's

631
00:46:32,685 --> 00:46:33,925
Speaker 7:  Just the freezing. Yeah.

632
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:37,445
Speaker 4:  I later realized that Shane from first Element had warned me about

633
00:46:37,445 --> 00:46:41,185
Speaker 4:  this. I even found a video from Toyota about it.

634
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:44,885
Speaker 32:  At times, the nozzle may become temporarily frozen and unable to

635
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,785
Speaker 32:  disconnect from the vehicle for several minutes. Do not

636
00:46:48,785 --> 00:46:52,405
Speaker 32:  try to remove it forcibly or you could cause damage to the nozzle

637
00:46:52,405 --> 00:46:54,735
Speaker 32:  vehicle or dispenser.

638
00:46:54,735 --> 00:46:58,645
Speaker 4:  Shane had told me the problem was largely resolved, which doesn't

639
00:46:58,645 --> 00:47:00,205
Speaker 4:  seem to be the case.

640
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:03,285
Speaker 7:  I met people here. They're like, oh, I carry a bottle of water with me and

641
00:47:03,285 --> 00:47:06,905
Speaker 7:  I just kind of pour a little bit just to loosen it up a bit.

642
00:47:06,905 --> 00:47:10,665
Speaker 32:  Do not pour water or spray chemicals on the nozzle.

643
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:14,485
Speaker 4:  All in all tigran is at the end of his rope. Does it feel like you're just

644
00:47:14,485 --> 00:47:17,585
Speaker 4:  in this kind of pilot program? Yes. Yeah,

645
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:21,405
Speaker 7:  But it wasn't sold like that when I got it. Okay. It was like, oh, you just

646
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:24,485
Speaker 7:  go to, it's like filling up a gas, your gas at a regular station. Right.

647
00:47:24,485 --> 00:47:28,365
Speaker 7:  You just go put it in and you're done. Yeah. And when it's working it, it's

648
00:47:28,365 --> 00:47:31,965
Speaker 7:  fine. That that's generally true. But yeah, most days it doesn't just

649
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:32,625
Speaker 7:  work.

650
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:35,905
Speaker 4:  So what do you think you're gonna do with the car long term?

651
00:47:35,905 --> 00:47:39,145
Speaker 7:  The resale value's? Very bad.

652
00:47:39,145 --> 00:47:41,605
Speaker 4:  Oh God. You're just really stuck. Yep.

653
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:44,795
Speaker 7:  I looked to trade it in for a Tesla and Tesla's like, we'll give you 10,000.

654
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,035
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I owe 30 on it.

655
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:50,815
Speaker 4:  That feeling of a bait and switch, we've heard that a lot. One

656
00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:54,685
Speaker 4:  Mirai driver, Denise says the dealer misled him about the value of

657
00:47:54,685 --> 00:47:55,585
Speaker 4:  the car

658
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:59,525
Speaker 9:  At the time of closing. They told me the actual value, this

659
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:03,445
Speaker 9:  car was 20, about 23,000. Okay. After I closed, they

660
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:06,675
Speaker 9:  told me it's actual value is $7,000.

661
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:07,825
Speaker 4:  What happened?

662
00:48:07,825 --> 00:48:11,765
Speaker 9:  So I think what they do, they try to factor in the fact that

663
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:14,565
Speaker 9:  they give you a fuel card for $15,000. Oh,

664
00:48:14,565 --> 00:48:16,205
Speaker 4:  They C, they consider that part of

665
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:19,115
Speaker 9:  The value of the car. They consider that part of the deal. Gotcha.

666
00:48:19,115 --> 00:48:22,825
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Okay. So now the resell value of the car is not what you thought it

667
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:23,045
Speaker 4:  was.

668
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:25,485
Speaker 9:  No, it's not. It's not what I thought it was.

669
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:29,245
Speaker 4:  I asked Toyota about this and they declined to comment on it, but they did

670
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:32,935
Speaker 4:  confirm that the fuel cards are not transferable altogether.

671
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:36,915
Speaker 4:  These stories started to paint a picture about how these cars were

672
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:40,605
Speaker 4:  sold to lots of people over and over. Drivers told us that they

673
00:48:40,605 --> 00:48:43,725
Speaker 4:  were shopping for a battery electric car. But

674
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:47,565
Speaker 4:  someone, a friend, a salesman, the internet talked them

675
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:51,465
Speaker 4:  into a Mariah. It was a new zero emission luxury

676
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:52,325
Speaker 4:  car. Yeah. It's

677
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:55,025
Speaker 31:  Like driving a Lexus or BMW.

678
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:58,625
Speaker 4:  And it was priced like a Toyota Camry. It was a win-win.

679
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:02,475
Speaker 4:  Except it wasn't. Here's one more. Mariah driver. Jonathan,

680
00:49:02,475 --> 00:49:04,545
Speaker 4:  what do you think you're gonna do with it long term?

681
00:49:04,545 --> 00:49:08,445
Speaker 33:  Get rid of it. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah, I will. But I do like

682
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,965
Speaker 33:  the newer models, don't get me wrong. They're very beautiful, but it doesn't

683
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:15,595
Speaker 33:  matter what model of the car comes out, it's just if,

684
00:49:15,595 --> 00:49:16,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah, if you can't drive it.

685
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:19,355
Speaker 33:  If you can't drive it.

686
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:23,045
Speaker 4:  Talking to these drivers made me think back to a very clarifying

687
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:26,895
Speaker 4:  moment at Harris Ranch. During our stakeout, we got

688
00:49:26,895 --> 00:49:30,735
Speaker 4:  bored and wandered over to the Tesla area and after

689
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:34,445
Speaker 4:  hours spent listening to fuel cell drivers, talk about hanging in

690
00:49:34,445 --> 00:49:38,285
Speaker 4:  there, meeting Tesla owners was a shock. Where you

691
00:49:38,285 --> 00:49:40,245
Speaker 4:  coming from? Where are you going to? We

692
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:43,335
Speaker 28:  Live in Metca and we're headed to Anaheim to go to Disneyland.

693
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:47,245
Speaker 34:  Super reliable and super easy to get charging

694
00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:50,155
Speaker 34:  everywhere. Yeah. So I'm excited. Yeah.

695
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:53,485
Speaker 35:  Road trips are amazing. When you have a Tesla and you have the whole

696
00:49:53,485 --> 00:49:54,195
Speaker 35:  thing,

697
00:49:54,195 --> 00:49:58,165
Speaker 4:  They were all just so unburdened. That's the best end

698
00:49:58,165 --> 00:50:02,085
Speaker 4:  state for any new technology. You forget about it and just use

699
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:05,485
Speaker 4:  it. And right now hydrogen just isn't

700
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:10,735
Speaker 4:  there.

701
00:50:10,735 --> 00:50:14,415
Speaker 4:  After everything we saw on this trip. There's one player I

702
00:50:14,415 --> 00:50:18,405
Speaker 4:  can't quite figure out. Toyota. Why is

703
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:22,325
Speaker 4:  Toyota still so committed to the Marai? In the first half

704
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:26,315
Speaker 4:  of this year, about 322 fuel cell cars

705
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:30,225
Speaker 4:  were sold in California total for reference.

706
00:50:30,225 --> 00:50:33,645
Speaker 4:  During that same period, maybe 200,000

707
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:37,345
Speaker 4:  battery EVs were sold in California alone.

708
00:50:37,345 --> 00:50:41,285
Speaker 4:  And yet Toyota is still marketing Mariahs and pushing them

709
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:44,785
Speaker 4:  at huge discounts. During the Paris Olympics this summer,

710
00:50:44,785 --> 00:50:48,725
Speaker 4:  Toyota provided 500 Marais to shuttle around

711
00:50:48,725 --> 00:50:52,055
Speaker 4:  athletes and bolster the green credentials of the Olympics,

712
00:50:52,055 --> 00:50:55,885
Speaker 4:  which actually upset a lot of environmentalists. So what's

713
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:59,745
Speaker 4:  Toyota's angle here? I spoke with Craig Scott, the general manager

714
00:50:59,745 --> 00:51:03,605
Speaker 4:  of fuel cell solutions. Craig said that hydrogen has

715
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:05,795
Speaker 4:  been a big hedge.

716
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:09,165
Speaker 36:  It's back to the foundational things of what are we trying to accomplish.

717
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,905
Speaker 36:  We're trying to remove carbon to the tailpipe. And the only way to do that

718
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:15,885
Speaker 36:  really, in a complete way, in a zero emission way, is, you know,

719
00:51:15,885 --> 00:51:19,165
Speaker 36:  there there are two competing technologies. Batteries and, and, and fuel

720
00:51:19,165 --> 00:51:22,725
Speaker 36:  cells. And so, you know, we wanted to make sure we had a good foothold in

721
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:23,545
Speaker 36:  both.

722
00:51:23,545 --> 00:51:26,575
Speaker 4:  Toyota continues to hedge more than most major

723
00:51:26,575 --> 00:51:29,895
Speaker 4:  automakers. It made hybrids a huge success with the

724
00:51:29,895 --> 00:51:33,425
Speaker 4:  Prius, but it's dragged its feet on full battery

725
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:37,305
Speaker 4:  EVs. Today. The company sells just one battery powered Toyota

726
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:40,995
Speaker 4:  and one model Lexus compared to more than a dozen

727
00:51:40,995 --> 00:51:44,885
Speaker 4:  hybrids. And the Marai critics have spent years dinging

728
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:48,765
Speaker 4:  Toyota for this. And the company does have a lot more battery models in the

729
00:51:48,765 --> 00:51:52,605
Speaker 4:  works, but it hasn't abandoned the Marai. I put

730
00:51:52,605 --> 00:51:56,325
Speaker 4:  this question to our transportation editor, Andy, why is Toyota sticking

731
00:51:56,325 --> 00:52:00,125
Speaker 4:  with the marai? He's mystified too. But he argued that

732
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,135
Speaker 4:  it's not just about the Marai.

733
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:05,955
Speaker 18:  These companies have this technology, they want to use it in some way.

734
00:52:05,955 --> 00:52:09,525
Speaker 18:  They spent a lot of money, they've invested in it and they want to get something

735
00:52:09,525 --> 00:52:12,525
Speaker 18:  out of it. So they're all sort of casting about and looking for ways in

736
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:15,725
Speaker 18:  which this, this fuel source can be useful for future

737
00:52:15,725 --> 00:52:17,105
Speaker 18:  applications.

738
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:21,005
Speaker 4:  Toyota is working on powering buses, trucks, and trains

739
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:24,015
Speaker 4:  with its fuel cells. It's developing stationary

740
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:27,885
Speaker 4:  generators and Honda Hyundai and other companies are doing

741
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:31,245
Speaker 4:  similar work. First element is investing in truck

742
00:52:31,245 --> 00:52:34,615
Speaker 4:  refueling. This is what our environment reporter Justine was talking

743
00:52:34,615 --> 00:52:38,485
Speaker 4:  about. There are other places that fuel cells might make

744
00:52:38,485 --> 00:52:42,365
Speaker 4:  more sense. It's the next step in that hedge. If any of

745
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:46,195
Speaker 4:  those industries go all in on hydrogen, Toyota and others

746
00:52:46,195 --> 00:52:49,845
Speaker 4:  will be there. And the marai its success or

747
00:52:49,845 --> 00:52:51,605
Speaker 4:  failure might not matter so

748
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:57,185
Speaker 4:  much.

749
00:52:57,185 --> 00:53:01,055
Speaker 4:  This is the big, this is the big one. We gotta see what the final price

750
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,635
Speaker 4:  tag is. It's the end of our road trip and we're at a gas

751
00:53:04,635 --> 00:53:08,415
Speaker 4:  station back in the Bay Area. Our rental was

752
00:53:08,415 --> 00:53:12,375
Speaker 4:  not point to point, so after we were done in LA we had to turn around

753
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:16,355
Speaker 4:  and drive back across California. We ended up taking the

754
00:53:16,355 --> 00:53:20,125
Speaker 4:  more scenic, high risk, high reward route along the 1 0 1.

755
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:24,115
Speaker 4:  The route Billy from Harris Ranch told us about it. Gave us one last hit

756
00:53:24,115 --> 00:53:28,105
Speaker 4:  of range anxiety. If the the first station is

757
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:31,285
Speaker 4:  out of order for any reason, then it's another 10 miles to the next

758
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:34,745
Speaker 4:  station, which we have budgeted in.

759
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:38,205
Speaker 4:  Yep. And if that's outta order, it's another 10 miles. So it

760
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:42,005
Speaker 4:  like, I could see this getting a little hairy, but so

761
00:53:42,005 --> 00:53:45,845
Speaker 4:  far we're okay. We pulled into San Jose

762
00:53:45,845 --> 00:53:49,445
Speaker 4:  with 40 miles left in the tank, all in. We put about

763
00:53:49,445 --> 00:53:53,005
Speaker 4:  875 miles on the car and a little more than three

764
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:56,965
Speaker 4:  days. We also had to return the Mariah with a full tank. So we

765
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:59,535
Speaker 4:  were treated to one last shock. 120

766
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:03,425
Speaker 4:  bucks, 130. What do we think? It's gotta

767
00:54:03,425 --> 00:54:06,355
Speaker 4:  be more than the most. Okay.

768
00:54:06,355 --> 00:54:09,685
Speaker 4:  4.605 kilograms,

769
00:54:09,685 --> 00:54:13,585
Speaker 4:  $165 and 78 cents. That's a big finish

770
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:17,475
Speaker 4:  for the road trip. If we'd been driving, say a Toyota Camry,

771
00:54:17,475 --> 00:54:21,445
Speaker 4:  we'd have spent about 30 bucks on gas road trip

772
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:25,365
Speaker 4:  complete. It's a good doable souvenir. The

773
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:26,835
Speaker 4:  most expensive tank I've ever

774
00:54:26,835 --> 00:54:36,305
Speaker 4:  purchased

775
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:40,255
Speaker 4:  In the back of my head. Throughout this story, I've thought a lot about

776
00:54:40,255 --> 00:54:43,915
Speaker 4:  laser discs of all things the failed competitor to

777
00:54:43,915 --> 00:54:47,845
Speaker 4:  DVDs. I've wondered, is that what this is? Is this

778
00:54:47,845 --> 00:54:51,765
Speaker 4:  just an alternate history story of why the world went this

779
00:54:51,765 --> 00:54:55,245
Speaker 4:  way instead of that way kind of thing? After taking this

780
00:54:55,245 --> 00:54:58,625
Speaker 4:  trip? I don't think that's quite right. Batteries

781
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:02,415
Speaker 4:  won, but I think that there's still some part of the future that's up for

782
00:55:02,415 --> 00:55:06,345
Speaker 4:  grabs. Hydrogen is still more portable than batteries

783
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:10,055
Speaker 4:  and it's a much faster way to move energy around. And

784
00:55:10,055 --> 00:55:12,725
Speaker 4:  there are still lots of hydrogen believers out

785
00:55:49,525 --> 00:55:52,595
Speaker 4:  everything, it was weirdly fun to be part of the fuel cell

786
00:55:52,595 --> 00:55:56,365
Speaker 4:  club. Most of the drivers I talked to were so open and

787
00:55:56,365 --> 00:56:00,045
Speaker 4:  honest and helpful. It was great to swap tips and stories with

788
00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:03,755
Speaker 4:  everybody. I got the sense there was a community here,

789
00:56:03,755 --> 00:56:07,685
Speaker 4:  even if it was based on shared grievance, that's probably not the

790
00:56:07,685 --> 00:56:11,565
Speaker 4:  way that Toyota or First Element wants drivers bonding. But I

791
00:56:11,565 --> 00:56:15,365
Speaker 4:  got a kick out of it. Case in point. After we filled

792
00:56:15,365 --> 00:56:18,925
Speaker 4:  up at the final gas station, I happened to see another Mirage

793
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:22,475
Speaker 4:  driver wandering from pump to pump, looking at all the little

794
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:26,445
Speaker 4:  screens. I asked him what was up and he said he couldn't get his

795
00:56:26,445 --> 00:56:30,285
Speaker 4:  pump to work. The screen was frozen. I told him the pump we

796
00:56:30,285 --> 00:56:34,035
Speaker 4:  used was fine and he pulled over to that one. And

797
00:56:34,035 --> 00:56:36,545
Speaker 4:  just like that, I was a fuel cell driver

798
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:56,755
Speaker 4:  too.

799
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:13,525
Speaker 2:  Verges YouTube channel. We also have a fun story
