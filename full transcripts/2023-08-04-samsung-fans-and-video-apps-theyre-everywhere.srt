00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,380
Speaker 3:  Hello and welcome to Vercast the flagship podcast of Linux on the

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,180
Speaker 3:  desktop. It's great. It's gonna happen this year. Here's a

4
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,010
Speaker 3:  stat for you.

5
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,500
Speaker 4:  This is the

6
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,440
Speaker 3:  Year Linux Gamers now outnumber Matt gamers on Steam because

7
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,490
Speaker 5:  Of Steam Deck.

8
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,660
Speaker 4:  That is a stat You're not wrong. That is a stat. It's a

9
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,370
Speaker 3:  Stat and it is because of the steam deck, which is technically not a

10
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,140
Speaker 3:  desktop. We were so close everybody. We're gonna do it next

11
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,320
Speaker 3:  year. It's the flagship podcast of Linnux on the desktop. Hello everybody.

12
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,940
Speaker 3:  I'm your friend Neli. That was David Pierce. Hey David. Hi.

13
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,000
Speaker 4:  I have returned from vacation. I have many new hot takes to share.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,580
Speaker 3:  I'm very excited And it's Alex Cranz. You heard going? It's because of the

15
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,860
Speaker 3:  steam deck. Hey Alex. Yeah,

16
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,800
Speaker 5:  I, I use the Steam deck and a Mac to game. I do not use Windows to Game.

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,860
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry. That

18
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,570
Speaker 3:  Is an unholy combination. What are you doing?

19
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,160
Speaker 5:  It's great. It's like I get everything I need. I get my Crusader Kings on

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,220
Speaker 5:  Mac. I get everything else on Steam Deck. It's fine.

21
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,880
Speaker 4:  Alex refuses to play any game the way it was intended. That's, that's really

22
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,660
Speaker 4:  Alex's thing.

23
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,420
Speaker 5:  It works great.

24
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,300
Speaker 3:  My TikTok feed is entirely tears of the Kingdom videos. That's all it

25
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,180
Speaker 3:  is. And every now again, so, and mostly it's like

26
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,980
Speaker 3:  incredible builds. Like that's like the z i engineering task force video.

27
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,300
Speaker 3:  Like it's so cool. Amazing. Yes. And then every now and again I get the people

28
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,140
Speaker 3:  who are running it emulated on a PC and they're doing mods

29
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,850
Speaker 3:  where everyone's a little too sexy. Yeah. And it's

30
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,490
Speaker 3:  just the, it's like that in general. I'm, you know, pro

31
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,210
Speaker 3:  modding, pro emulation, pro run whatever code you want, wherever you want

32
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,080
Speaker 3:  anti D R M. And then I see those videos and I'm like, all these

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,860
Speaker 3:  people should be in jail. Like I don't know how to get too sexy. Too sexy,

34
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,590
Speaker 3:  too sexy. Don't like it. I don't need to see a sexy link.

35
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,350
Speaker 3:  He's always sexy. What are you talking about? He's inherently sexy.

36
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,320
Speaker 3:  Alright, here's what we're gonna do this week. It's a relatively slow

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,160
Speaker 3:  Newsweek, but we have been getting just

38
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,810
Speaker 3:  a ton of incredible reader emails lately,

39
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,440
Speaker 3:  which are super fun. So we're gonna do a lightning

40
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,810
Speaker 3:  round, then read a bunch of emails and then do a lightning

41
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,410
Speaker 3:  round. We'll see how that goes. It's the first time we've tried it on the

42
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,330
Speaker 3:  show. I think it's gonna be fun. But before we do that, it is necessary

43
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,410
Speaker 3:  to acknowledge the existence of one Elon

44
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,200
Speaker 3:  Musk who

45
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,110
Speaker 3:  just continues to dominate the news cycle. I'll let you in on some Vergecast

46
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,810
Speaker 3:  inside baseball. We do the show and we like look at what

47
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,250
Speaker 3:  stories are the most popular on our site to be like, this is what people

48
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,090
Speaker 3:  are interested in. And you people will not stop clicking on the Elon

49
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,030
Speaker 3:  stories.

50
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,470
Speaker 4:  Yep.

51
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,370
Speaker 3:  But we are tired. So to split the difference, here's what we're doing. My

52
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,080
Speaker 3:  friend David Pierce is gonna give you the fastest

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,940
Speaker 3:  Elon roundup in sports. And I. Believe we have some

54
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,660
Speaker 3:  music. Andrew, can you run the music? This is an incredibly

55
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,540
Speaker 4:  Rude thing to do to

56
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,770
Speaker 3:  Me in my first week back. By the way,

57
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,220
Speaker 4:  Like David, talk as fast as you can for two minutes about Elon Musk.

58
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,900
Speaker 3:  Ready? Go. Go. And to be

59
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,660
Speaker 3:  clear, I'm forcing David to do this against his will. The

60
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,370
Speaker 3:  face that he made at me when I suggested he do this

61
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,110
Speaker 3:  came through the internet. Imagine the amount of engineering and

62
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,960
Speaker 3:  labor and invention and discovery that was required

63
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,740
Speaker 3:  for David's frown to travel hundreds of thousands of

64
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,300
Speaker 3:  miles through fiber optic cables at the speed of light. And then hit me in

65
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,790
Speaker 3:  the face.

66
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,620
Speaker 4:  Can't buy that for $44 billion.

67
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,200
Speaker 3:  I can't do it. It's very important.

68
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,130
Speaker 3:  Anyhow, I'm still making David do it 'cause we we, a bunch of stuff happened.

69
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,140
Speaker 3:  Just none of it's very important. But we should acknowledge it because we

70
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,100
Speaker 3:  know that you, the listeners, even though you sent us email telling us not

71
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,620
Speaker 3:  to do it, you keep reading the stories. But we're gonna make a game a bit.

72
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,500
Speaker 3:  See if we can get through it. Andrew, I believe we have some

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:13,760
Speaker 3:  music.

74
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,130
Speaker 3:  You have to start talking.

75
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,940
Speaker 4:  Here is everything you need to know about Elon Musk this week. Twitter is

76
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,140
Speaker 4:  now X and it's actually called X in the app store. Even though it's still

77
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,500
Speaker 4:  not called X. A lot of places there's X Pro, but it's just tweet deck. Twitter

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,170
Speaker 4:  is x, X is Twitter. No one knows where it actually is. There was an X

79
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,980
Speaker 4:  sign on the old Twitter headquarters, which is now the X headquarters. It

80
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,340
Speaker 4:  blinded everybody. It was sandbags, it was dangerous. Now it's gone. The

81
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,660
Speaker 4:  company is now trying to get financial companies like Robinhood and maybe

82
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,830
Speaker 4:  other kinds of stock trading platforms to bring their content and even do

83
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,720
Speaker 4:  stock trading on X but won't pay anybody to do it and actually wants

84
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,380
Speaker 4:  the other companies to pay to do it. They're not gonna do it. So that's not

85
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,240
Speaker 4:  going anywhere. Twitter slash X is suing a group called the Center

86
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,540
Speaker 4:  for Countering Digital Hate Over claims that it tried to drive away advertisers

87
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,880
Speaker 4:  by basically acknowledging that bad things happen on the platform and that

88
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,700
Speaker 4:  people do bad things on the platform. That's not gonna work. And then

89
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,540
Speaker 4:  lastly, Twitter, sorry, X was going to be dark mode only,

90
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,910
Speaker 4:  but now it's not going to be dark mode only because the thing you learn about

91
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,320
Speaker 4:  Elon Musk when you leave for a week is that nothing actually

92
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,240
Speaker 4:  happens. A thing just happens and then UN happens a few days later. And

93
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,890
Speaker 4:  that's the story of Elon Musk.

94
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,000
Speaker 3:  Let's let the solo wrap

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,520
Speaker 3:  up.

96
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,350
Speaker 5:  I didn't know the music went so long.

97
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,480
Speaker 3:  It's so good. That was press. That was very good. It defeated

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,230
Speaker 4:  The music, the

99
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,030
Speaker 3:  Royalty free guitar, solo music, absolutely choice.

100
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,620
Speaker 3:  This is beautiful. Second only to the animated Transformers movie, which

101
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,600
Speaker 3:  if you listen to it, the, from the eighties I watched it again as an

102
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,640
Speaker 3:  adult and having only ever watched it as a child, that movie is one long

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,250
Speaker 3:  guitar solo. Like it just never stops. It breaks into

104
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,040
Speaker 3:  other songs. But then the songs that and the

105
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,480
Speaker 3:  solo continues. I'm just saying we should bring that back. Is

106
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,120
Speaker 5:  It a musical? Does it count as, it counts as a musical, right? If it's just

107
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,720
Speaker 5:  one long guitar solo,

108
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,660
Speaker 3:  I guess it's, it's a very confusing movie and also really heartbreaking in,

109
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,070
Speaker 3:  in various ways. Transformers, everybody, that's the verse cast. Okay.

110
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,030
Speaker 3:  Lightning round one. So lots of little news this week.

111
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,810
Speaker 3:  Lots of glimmers of big ideas, but ultimately small news.

112
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,800
Speaker 3:  David kick us off.

113
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,880
Speaker 4:  Okay, I have two because I was gone for a week, so I think I get to have

114
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,780
Speaker 4:  two. That's fair. My first is a discovery that I made while I was on vacation

115
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,440
Speaker 4:  and feel obligated to come back and tell you about, which is that actually

116
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,900
Speaker 4:  CarPlay is very bad. And what, no, David.

117
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,600
Speaker 4:  No,

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,920
Speaker 3:  This is, yeah,

119
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,860
Speaker 4:  This I, I regret that I have come to this place. This is

120
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,840
Speaker 4:  not, this is not a life I wanted to lead, but I,

121
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,700
Speaker 4:  I updated my phone at one point over the week and then it just spent a

122
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,680
Speaker 4:  day and a half deciding not to connect to CarPlay and when it

123
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,600
Speaker 4:  did, it would crash and then it would say, David, would you like to

124
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,440
Speaker 4:  start a thing in Google Maps? And I would say Yes, please Google Maps, that

125
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,540
Speaker 4:  sounds terrific. And it would just do nothing. And it would just

126
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,360
Speaker 4:  say I was sitting at an intersection when I had driven many miles

127
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,340
Speaker 4:  away from that in intersection and then one day for absolutely

128
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,540
Speaker 4:  no reason, it just started to work again and has worked perfectly ever since.

129
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,280
Speaker 4:  So now I've reached a point where like I wish it had been full broken

130
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,190
Speaker 4:  because then at least I would understand what was going on. Yeah, And. I

131
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,700
Speaker 4:  just CarPlay sucks. The thing that is still true is that everything else

132
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,680
Speaker 4:  is still worse. So CarPlay is still the best available option as

133
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,020
Speaker 4:  far as I can tell. I actually think Android Auto is better than CarPlay.

134
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,600
Speaker 4:  My wife is a pixel owner. And I mostly use an iPhone. So we switch back and

135
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,100
Speaker 4:  forth some and the, the Android auto experience was substantially better

136
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,790
Speaker 4:  in most cases. But they're all bad. Yeah, but everything else is worse.

137
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,190
Speaker 3:  It's funny 'cause they're converging. Okay. Oh god. All right. So I have

138
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,120
Speaker 3:  data to back this up. No. So the first piece of

139
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,080
Speaker 3:  data is that I was right to begin with. I hate this and now David agrees

140
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,570
Speaker 3:  with me.

141
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,990
Speaker 4:  These are the rules. CarPlay is now officially bad. I'm really sorry.

142
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,220
Speaker 5:  It's the worst.

143
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,070
Speaker 3:  Here's a piece of news from last week. According to JD

144
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,700
Speaker 3:  Power's automotive performance, execution and layout or

145
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,280
Speaker 3:  appeal study overall satisfaction with car

146
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,200
Speaker 3:  owners is down a decrease of two points from a year ago in three points

147
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,680
Speaker 3:  lower than 2021. First time in 28 years of the

148
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,560
Speaker 3:  study that there's a consecutive year over year decline in owner

149
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,340
Speaker 3:  satisfaction. And it is because of the infotainment systems.

150
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,530
Speaker 3:  Now most people are mad at the actual infotainment systems in their cars.

151
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,150
Speaker 3:  Makes sense. But the finickiness of wireless

152
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,440
Speaker 3:  CarPlay in particular and wireless Android Android Auto Yep. Is absolutely

153
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,380
Speaker 3:  contributing to this. And there is an increase

154
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,120
Speaker 3:  in the Google powered native infotainment systems that some people are shipping

155
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,040
Speaker 3:  like Volvo and others. So cars that have Android Automotive or a A

156
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,920
Speaker 3:  O S score higher in the infotainment categories, then those with no

157
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,830
Speaker 3:  A A O S whatsoever. Okay. But if you have that without Google

158
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,740
Speaker 3:  Play Services, you go down. Yeah. So if you have built

159
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,320
Speaker 3:  in Google Maps, basically people are happy. Yeah. 'cause then they can listen,

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Speaker 3:  they can Stream Bluetooth over their phones and look at Google Maps, which

161
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,320
Speaker 3:  is all anybody wants to do. Correct. Right in the car. No one's trying to

162
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,000
Speaker 3:  watch a TikTok in a Mercedes. I don't know why they keep doing it. If you

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,240
Speaker 3:  go watch the videos of people trying to scroll TikTok in Mercedes, you're

164
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,720
Speaker 3:  like, that is the slowest shittiest TikTok experience I've ever seen in my

165
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,360
Speaker 3:  entire life. And

166
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Speaker 5:  Also it's like unsafe. Probably shouldn't scroll

167
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,040
Speaker 5:  TikTok while driving. Yeah.

168
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,240
Speaker 3:  Also don't do that. Yeah. Is is a good, yeah.

169
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,630
Speaker 5:  Like I definitely got yelled at for watching Gilmore Girls while driving

170
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,280
Speaker 5:  home from college one year and it was great. I had a

171
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,230
Speaker 5:  wonderful time, but I was told I wasn't

172
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,180
Speaker 3:  Like in the car while you were driving. Yeah, I, Rory couldn't wait.

173
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,840
Speaker 5:  She could not, I had to be up early. I was doing like a 12 hour

174
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,030
Speaker 5:  drive in a day. I needed company.

175
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,940
Speaker 3:  This is some real Texas shit. And this road is going to be perfectly straight

176
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,760
Speaker 3:  for 600 miles. Pretty

177
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,140
Speaker 5:  Much

178
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,080
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna do it. The speed limit is 230 miles an

179
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,830
Speaker 3:  hour and I'm gonna watch Gilmore Girls the entire time.

180
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,820
Speaker 5:  Wonderful. No regrets. But yeah, I wouldn't probably do it

181
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,000
Speaker 5:  now most likely. Yeah.

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,200
Speaker 3:  Only now you can, you know, hit self-driving watch on the center cluster.

183
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,170
Speaker 3:  Yeah. All I'm saying is there's data, actual data, not just me saying it,

184
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,060
Speaker 3:  that that suggests that making the center

185
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,790
Speaker 3:  stack of your car more computer is

186
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,890
Speaker 3:  bad. Yes.

187
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,370
Speaker 5:  I think that's right.

188
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,270
Speaker 3:  Wireless CarPlay is like a maximally computer idea.

189
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,770
Speaker 3:  Yes. Like it's finicky and it doesn't connect and you're trying to meet and

190
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,710
Speaker 3:  you're basically adding a second display to a mobile computer. Like

191
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,530
Speaker 3:  ugh, just bolt the phone to the air vent like God

192
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,370
Speaker 3:  intended open Google Maps and Stream Bluetooth music to the head unit. You'll

193
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,970
Speaker 3:  be fine. You get two screens instead of one. I'm just gonna keep putting

194
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,730
Speaker 3:  that up. But you

195
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,130
Speaker 5:  Can just plug it in and have CarPlay, And, I. I did that this week. I got

196
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,730
Speaker 5:  my MagSafe like little controller thing. I stuck it in the air

197
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,370
Speaker 5:  vent. It didn't flip down too much. And I had like my big

198
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,040
Speaker 5:  screen and my little screen and one was for like text

199
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,890
Speaker 5:  messages that I tried not to look at. And the other one

200
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,240
Speaker 5:  found

201
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,880
Speaker 4:  Out, do we need to start disclaiming? Like no one listened to Alex when she

202
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,820
Speaker 4:  describes how she lives her life because it will, it will end in disaster

203
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,990
Speaker 4:  for you.

204
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,840
Speaker 3:  Alex is like, here's what I did. I sparked my laser bong. I started

205
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,130
Speaker 3:  texting while I was driving. But CarPlay was great. Yeah,

206
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,560
Speaker 5:  We're all

207
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,220
Speaker 5:  good

208
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,140
Speaker 5:  anyway. CarPlay is great.

209
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,320
Speaker 3:  All right. In normal circumstance, I would say we should retake the part

210
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,440
Speaker 3:  where Alex admitted to texting and driving. I didn't text, but here I think

211
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,050
Speaker 3:  it's an important cautionary tale.

212
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,940
Speaker 5:  Don't don't text and drive guys. I looked at it And, I went, oh that's convenient.

213
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,900
Speaker 5:  Ooh, let's not look at that. And then I just kept driving.

214
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,640
Speaker 4:  That's good. Good for you. We're all really proud of you. Alex. That's, that's

215
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,020
Speaker 4:  called personal growth. Thank you.

216
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,360
Speaker 3:  All right. CarPlay sucks. Unless you're Alex, in which case you should throw

217
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,020
Speaker 3:  your phone out the window. And. I. Have someone else use CarPlay.

218
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,000
Speaker 4:  But I just wanna say before I get to my actual lightning round thing, Andy

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,340
Speaker 4:  Hawkins wrote about that JD Power thing you were just talking about. Yeah.

220
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,440
Speaker 4:  And his headline was just people are getting fed up with all the useless

221
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,320
Speaker 4:  tech in their cars. And, I just read that headline and just like started

222
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,840
Speaker 4:  blowing kisses at my computer. Like it's just Yes. Like what a, what a perfect

223
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,550
Speaker 4:  description of A this study and B,

224
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,200
Speaker 4:  what is happening in the world. I enjoy that very much and thank you Andy

225
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,280
Speaker 4:  for doing that for me.

226
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,880
Speaker 3:  Actually the best part of his story is that he, he notes that happiness with

227
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,710
Speaker 3:  the exterior styling of cars is going down as well because

228
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,950
Speaker 3:  cars look weird now and that's beautiful.

229
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's, it's bad times for cars right now. It's

230
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,070
Speaker 5:  Boring and ugly.

231
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,160
Speaker 4:  Like Neli, you keep talking about like the dongle stuff and we're sort of

232
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,680
Speaker 4:  caught in this awkward middle ground. We're we're caught in the awkward middle

233
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,560
Speaker 4:  ground in like every way imaginable with cars. Yeah.

234
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,490
Speaker 3:  The only two ideas we have for cars are make it look like the sixties or

235
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,520
Speaker 3:  angry robots. The

236
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,360
Speaker 4:  Future. Yeah. It's not great but

237
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,190
Speaker 4:  okay, my actual lightning round thing is this new

238
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,960
Speaker 4:  YouTube announcement this week that they're adding a bunch of new features

239
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,940
Speaker 4:  to Shorts. And the quickest way I can describe them is that they're just

240
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,800
Speaker 4:  TikTok things. So now you can see vertical live

241
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,360
Speaker 4:  previews of videos in Shorts. So when you're scrolling through and in addition

242
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,920
Speaker 4:  to just seeing Shorts, you'll see live stuff. There's a new tool where you

243
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,600
Speaker 4:  can actually like crop and zoom on a regular horizontal

244
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,340
Speaker 4:  YouTube video and use it as a short, which I actually think is very clever

245
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,680
Speaker 4:  and is one of the things that makes YouTube unique is that there's this whole

246
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,460
Speaker 4:  other giant library of stuff and then there's a tool that they call

247
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,360
Speaker 4:  collab, which is just a straight complete rip of duet on TikTok

248
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,880
Speaker 4:  And I think it's very funny that they didn't just call it duet. Like we're

249
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,040
Speaker 4:  all cool with stories being the thing that everybody does, but YouTube is

250
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,020
Speaker 4:  like collab, not like duet at all. Totally different.

251
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,000
Speaker 4:  But I just, we, we've talked about this a bunch on this show, but it's like

252
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,640
Speaker 4:  there is just only one app anymore. Yeah. It's just called like

253
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,160
Speaker 4:  video in all caps. And it's TikTok, it's

254
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,730
Speaker 4:  reels, it's YouTube, Shorts. These, all these things are the same

255
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,340
Speaker 4:  thing and it's kind of, it's just making me tired.

256
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:50,820
Speaker 4:  Now

257
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,440
Speaker 5:  Do you ever find yourself accidentally scrolling the wrong one and not realizing

258
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,320
Speaker 5:  it for more than 30 seconds? Or

259
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,220
Speaker 5:  is that just me,

260
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,940
Speaker 4:  The thing that happens to me frequently is I'll go onto

261
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,640
Speaker 4:  TikTok, scroll a bunch, be like, why don't I care about any of these

262
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,920
Speaker 4:  videos and then realize I'm actually on Instagram. That's me,

263
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,320
Speaker 5:  That's

264
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,000
Speaker 4:  Me. This is a thing that has happened to me several times from like usually

265
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,920
Speaker 4:  like I kind of know what my TikTok is gonna be. It morphs over time, but

266
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,500
Speaker 4:  I have a rough sense of what I'm gonna get from TikTok most of the time.

267
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,140
Speaker 4:  And then I go on Instagram and it's just like, here's people playing Spikeball

268
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,960
Speaker 4:  and like random Russian soccer players

269
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,740
Speaker 4:  that you've never heard of and I'm just And I. I like spend three minutes.

270
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,920
Speaker 4:  I'm like, this is boring. And then I'm like, oh, I'm on Instagram. Like this

271
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,830
Speaker 4:  is where I'm at.

272
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,470
Speaker 5:  It's like when I see like three videos in a row of somebody just cutting

273
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,310
Speaker 5:  sand, I'm like, oh, I think I'm on Instagram.

274
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,100
Speaker 5:  Okay.

275
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,940
Speaker 3:  Or it's, it's particular if you see the the trends from three months

276
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,800
Speaker 3:  ago. Yeah. Yeah. Oh God. That's the real tell on Instagram. But here's the

277
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,120
Speaker 3:  thing about Instagram, which is fascinating. Meta just had earnings. They

278
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,740
Speaker 3:  were boring. Meta's doing great, fine. They basically solved the Apple

279
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,440
Speaker 3:  ad tracking transparency issue with ai. So they're, they're making a lot

280
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,390
Speaker 3:  of money. They also revealed that Reels is making money

281
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,200
Speaker 3:  hand over fist now and is on track to be a bigger

282
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,110
Speaker 3:  business than TikTok, which is wild and kind

283
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,030
Speaker 3:  of a testament to Meta's overall scale and expertise in

284
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,970
Speaker 3:  monetizing things.

285
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,070
Speaker 4:  Yet another reminder that Meta is the only company that is actually good

286
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,070
Speaker 4:  at this. Like it's, it's the thing I've been saying about threads all along.

287
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,750
Speaker 4:  Like everybody can have the same idea and Meta will do it better over

288
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,690
Speaker 4:  time, at least from a financial perspective it just keeps being true

289
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,310
Speaker 4:  and it's, it's truly wild. Like Reels is a objectively worse

290
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,830
Speaker 4:  product than TikTok. Like I don't think there's anybody who would be like,

291
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,990
Speaker 4:  I prefer reels to TikTok as a like user consumer

292
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,910
Speaker 4:  experience, but I'm not at all surprised that it's gonna end

293
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,050
Speaker 4:  up being the bigger business.

294
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,830
Speaker 3:  So here's the numbers. Reel's annual revenue run rate has jumped to

295
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,910
Speaker 3:  $10 billion a year. Wow. Up from 3 billion last fall and a billion last

296
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,790
Speaker 3:  summer. That's from Zuckerberg during his analyst call that means reel's

297
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,697
Speaker 3:  about the size of TikTok business. Last year when TikTok pulled in 9.9 billion

298
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,830
Speaker 3:  and we're allowed to add revenue and reel's about to grow, that's this Reuters

299
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,670
Speaker 3:  story that will like, that's crazy, right? They went from not having this

300
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,910
Speaker 3:  product to being deeply threatened by it to running a bigger and more

301
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,150
Speaker 3:  effective business with it. And, and maybe this is

302
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,030
Speaker 3:  like cautionary tale for threads. This is kind of

303
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,860
Speaker 3:  the meta problem now. They run huge businesses

304
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,830
Speaker 3:  with no cultural relevance. I mean, right? That's what we were talking, that's

305
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,950
Speaker 3:  what you're talking about with reels. You open reels, you like scroll through

306
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,910
Speaker 3:  it, like this isn't what I want. Yep. And you jump to TikTok, which is far

307
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,630
Speaker 3:  more relevant, but they are better at the business. I

308
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,150
Speaker 5:  Think it's, it is culturally relevant and the fact that

309
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,030
Speaker 5:  like all of my online friends send me TikTok, all

310
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,510
Speaker 5:  my normal friends, offline friends, whatever you wanna call 'em, you know

311
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,400
Speaker 5:  what I'm talking about Everybody listening, you've got both sides. They all

312
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,170
Speaker 5:  send me reels. Like my best friend from college, she sends me reels

313
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,160
Speaker 5:  about cowboy girls. Yeah. My, my best friend like that I worked with at

314
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,680
Speaker 5:  my last company, she sends me tos and it's

315
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,600
Speaker 5:  just, yeah, I like And that's a smaller group. Those people that are

316
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,500
Speaker 5:  really online like us, we're a much smaller part of the population.

317
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,020
Speaker 5:  And so the stuff that actually goes out to people and changes the culture

318
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,620
Speaker 5:  is happening on reels even though it's being incubated and and developed

319
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,720
Speaker 5:  on TikTok.

320
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,200
Speaker 4:  Although I think the younger you get the less That's true. That's, and this

321
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,480
Speaker 4:  is the thing that Meta continues to trade on, right? Is that like whenever

322
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,240
Speaker 4:  I come on this show or write about Facebook and say basically nobody's

323
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,120
Speaker 4:  on Facebook, nobody cares. I get a bunch of people responding who are like,

324
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
Speaker 4:  no, actually the thing is everybody's on Facebook, they're just old and

325
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,760
Speaker 4:  that's true. Yeah. And there's a lot of money in those people. But the

326
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,120
Speaker 4:  like as you scale down the age group, like truly nobody is on

327
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,560
Speaker 4:  Facebook. And at least in the sort of

328
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,150
Speaker 4:  limited access I have to the world of 16 year olds, like

329
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,440
Speaker 4:  they're all on Snapchat and they're all on TikTok and they're all kind of

330
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,240
Speaker 4:  on Instagram and that's it. Like that is the extent of it. What's

331
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,140
Speaker 3:  Fascinating about this conversation is it, it was prompted by you discussing

332
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,980
Speaker 3:  new features being added to YouTube, which is

333
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,910
Speaker 3:  the most stable scaled social platform to exist.

334
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,560
Speaker 3:  It's still doing the thing. It does except it's also trying to do the new

335
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:10,980
Speaker 3:  thing.

336
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,880
Speaker 5:  Shorts alarms me every time I click on it, like I get confused and

337
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,640
Speaker 5:  then have to like quit the app. 'cause I don't know where I am and how to

338
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,700
Speaker 5:  get away from it. Is am I the only one?

339
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,750
Speaker 3:  Do you, is it like a feeling like I'm training the wrong algorithm?

340
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,720
Speaker 5:  It's partially that and partially just like the video's big and I'm

341
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,240
Speaker 5:  like, the video's not supposed to be big here. It's supposed to be the other

342
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,120
Speaker 5:  way. What's happening? I don't like it. I just get very old as

343
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,360
Speaker 5:  soon as

344
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,440
Speaker 4:  I, who are these kids and what are they? Why are they eating hot wings? you

345
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,040
Speaker 4:  know? Yeah.

346
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,360
Speaker 5:  I just to turn immediately turn 80. But

347
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,880
Speaker 4:  This is why, to your point, Eli, this is why YouTube has been so fascinating

348
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,840
Speaker 4:  to me for so long. Because it is I think the

349
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,660
Speaker 4:  single most like sprawling ambitious platform

350
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,480
Speaker 4:  on the internet, right? Like YouTube wants to be, it wants to eat

351
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,520
Speaker 4:  Hollywood, it wants to eat the podcasting business, it wants to eat the music

352
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,080
Speaker 4:  business, it wants to eat the creator business, it wants to eat the social

353
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,240
Speaker 4:  business. Like YouTube literally wants to be the size of the

354
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,190
Speaker 4:  like creative entertainment internet and

355
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,160
Speaker 4:  it's kind of working and it's really, really fascinating to watch that

356
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,920
Speaker 4:  happen. I think Shorts by all accounts seems to be

357
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,720
Speaker 4:  growing really fast and doing really well, but in the way that you would

358
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,120
Speaker 4:  expect it to because it's attached to YouTube. Like I don't know that it

359
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,960
Speaker 4:  has hit sort of bigger than YouTube escape velocity in the way that like

360
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,350
Speaker 4:  Facebook marketplace is very successful because it's on Facebook but is not

361
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,200
Speaker 4:  sort of successful on its own. Yeah. I think that's kind of what Shortz is

362
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,110
Speaker 4:  doing. But then even just this week,

363
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,920
Speaker 4:  YouTube is getting some of Google's generative AI stuff to

364
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,780
Speaker 4:  get summaries of videos that are in the like in search results and

365
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,760
Speaker 4:  in the video pages so you can see what you're getting. They're adding YouTube

366
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,750
Speaker 4:  videos to the SS g E search, generative experience AI stuff

367
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,320
Speaker 4:  like YouTube is everything to everyone at all

368
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,280
Speaker 4:  times. And then just kind of over here on the side, they're just ruthlessly

369
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,240
Speaker 4:  copying TikTok and paying creators better. And it's just sort of nuts to

370
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,790
Speaker 4:  watch all of that happen simultaneously. Yeah.

371
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,570
Speaker 3:  YouTube and Google generally are in this very odd moment

372
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,470
Speaker 3:  where they, all of their incentives have been about

373
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,280
Speaker 3:  padding things out for so long that now all the

374
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,800
Speaker 3:  results are too long. And like honestly what TikTok

375
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,600
Speaker 3:  offers you as a search customer is like, it'll just

376
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,870
Speaker 3:  tell you the answer like quickly in a way that a

377
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,620
Speaker 3:  webpage that's ss e o optimized or a YouTube video that's

378
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,440
Speaker 3:  padded out to get two minerals, like won't, I'll give you one very stupid

379
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,240
Speaker 3:  example. We bought a jar of Chili Crisp and the lid is too

380
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,740
Speaker 3:  tight. And I was like, what? What? How do you do the thing? you know like

381
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,700
Speaker 3:  is it cold water? Is it hot water? And I had that moment of like, I'm gonna

382
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,450
Speaker 3:  ask a search engine for this. And we picked TikTok and now

383
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,680
Speaker 3:  fully every other video I watch is about opening jars because TikTok algorithm

384
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,600
Speaker 3:  is stupid. But but it like, you know, just a p like

385
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,720
Speaker 3:  someone just like told me the answer in like four seconds. Yeah, yeah. Whereas

386
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,680
Speaker 3:  like I've had watched a 10 minute YouTube video, I would've killed myself.

387
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,280
Speaker 3:  Like you

388
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,680
Speaker 4:  Would've had to watch someone like start the video outside and then like

389
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,080
Speaker 4:  walk into their house and then tell you the history of jars. Exactly. And

390
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,570
Speaker 4:  yeah,

391
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,880
Speaker 3:  Right. Or you like search the regular Google search engine and you're like,

392
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,680
Speaker 3:  okay, here's 40,000 words about jars. Right? And it's

393
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,240
Speaker 3:  like every other heading is a question about jars. Like what are jars made

394
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,070
Speaker 3:  of? And it's like, I just like, this is a very simple question.

395
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,120
Speaker 3:  Like is it hot water or cold water? The answer by the way is hot water and

396
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,340
Speaker 3:  it still didn't work. It doesn't matter. We're gonna get that jar up in Sunday.

397
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:32,560
Speaker 3:  You

398
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,920
Speaker 5:  Get a butter knife and you jam it under under the lid

399
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,560
Speaker 3:  Everything you say. So, so

400
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,520
Speaker 5:  I mean ignore a bandaid on my finger. That's a

401
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,680
Speaker 3:  Different race. Here's what you do. You start texting and driving while us

402
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,800
Speaker 3:  trying to open a jar with a knife.

403
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,180
Speaker 5:  I still got my hands, my fingers. It's fine.

404
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,960
Speaker 4:  You just put it in the oven, turn it all the way up, see what happens. It's

405
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,460
Speaker 4:  gonna be fine.

406
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:50,960
Speaker 3:  All I'm saying

407
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,760
Speaker 3:  is turn

408
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,720
Speaker 3:  on all the gas, all your ranges light and walk

409
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,460
Speaker 3:  around with a match.

410
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,960
Speaker 5:  The Chris the chili will be

411
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,540
Speaker 5:  Chris.

412
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,600
Speaker 3:  All I'm saying is it's kind of interesting to think of the internet as a

413
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,560
Speaker 3:  pendulum between long things and short things and like we're, we've just

414
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,160
Speaker 3:  been like YouTube originally started with Charlie bit my finger, right?

415
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,820
Speaker 3:  Like extremely short stupid videos and a pendulum

416
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,800
Speaker 3:  has swung to these like 10 minute videos and now that sort of tos and

417
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,780
Speaker 3:  reels and Shorts are swinging at pendulum back and basically only meta

418
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,920
Speaker 3:  has figured out how to build a scaled business against it. Yeah. It, it's

419
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,300
Speaker 3:  not to say tos $10 billion is not a scaled business, but you know,

420
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,680
Speaker 3:  TikTok rickety for a lot of reasons. Do we

421
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,860
Speaker 5:  Ever hit that middle point though, where it's just like

422
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,320
Speaker 3:  Middle videos?

423
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,840
Speaker 4:  I don't think so. I mean, I I can't think of a time we've been at that point,

424
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,760
Speaker 4:  right? Any I mean you can even look at it like Yeah, the, the streaming

425
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,280
Speaker 4:  has done that right? Everything got everything got bigger and huger and then

426
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,160
Speaker 4:  got smaller and became, you know, big, big TV shows and then we

427
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,100
Speaker 4:  got the limited maybe like the limited series is the perfect middle of

428
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,360
Speaker 4:  the actual like TV movie world and we need the equivalent of

429
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,560
Speaker 4:  that for

430
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,070
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Only that's the thing that's causing the writers.

431
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,320
Speaker 4:  Well yeah, there's that right? Like damn

432
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,880
Speaker 3:  It, there's no series, no syndication, there's no money in limited

433
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,510
Speaker 4:  Series. It turns out

434
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,090
Speaker 3:  Like that's a real problem. This is the worst lightning round of all time.

435
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,940
Speaker 3:  We've done two things. It's been 25.

436
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,400
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry, I'm done. That's it all. I have

437
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,670
Speaker 3:  Alex what's your, what's yours?

438
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,660
Speaker 5:  Okay, mine is, Sean has a really great review of the

439
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,820
Speaker 5:  LG. I'm gonna, I gotta look at this guys LG

440
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,660
Speaker 5:  27 g R 95

441
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,020
Speaker 5:  QE B

442
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Speaker 3:  And when people hear that name it's sex.

443
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,460
Speaker 5:  You wanna go to Best Buy and ask for the LG 27 G R

444
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,000
Speaker 5:  95 QE

445
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,680
Speaker 5:  B It's great. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a new 27

446
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,670
Speaker 5:  inch ole display and he's, he tested some of the other ones. There was an

447
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,600
Speaker 5:  ause one that has like kind of this pretty much the same panel but a

448
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,520
Speaker 5:  little bit different. Like how you control it is different. But

449
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,400
Speaker 5:  he, he really liked this one and feels like we're kind of hitting that point

450
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,200
Speaker 5:  where you can say, yeah I can go buy an OLED monitor instead

451
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,680
Speaker 5:  of a traditional monitor. And that's really exciting

452
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,520
Speaker 5:  because OLED is typically better but a lot of those growing pains OLED

453
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,160
Speaker 5:  have had are still there. It's got some issues like it's

454
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,960
Speaker 5:  local dimming you would think would be really, really good, right? 'cause

455
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,880
Speaker 5:  it's oled and so each pixel is controlled but the minute things start to

456
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,160
Speaker 5:  get bigger and bigger and wider and wider, it needs to start limiting that

457
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,440
Speaker 5:  so it doesn't blow out all those pixels and, and create burn and a lot of

458
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,300
Speaker 5:  other problems. And when it starts to do that, it gets really, really dim

459
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,280
Speaker 5:  and can just be super unpleasant to look at. It sounds

460
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,060
Speaker 5:  like they've, they've done a good job of of fixing that. It's still not perfect

461
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,860
Speaker 5:  but it's gotten a lot better. And so, I don't know, I have two of

462
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,640
Speaker 5:  the previous really good LG monitors on my, on my

463
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,560
Speaker 5:  desk. And I love them and now I have total fomo, And I wish I

464
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,080
Speaker 5:  had this oled even though it's got some issues, it just seems

465
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,670
Speaker 5:  cool.

466
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,240
Speaker 3:  This piece and another one we're gonna talk about, about three D file formats

467
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,640
Speaker 3:  are like the reason The Verge exists in my opinion. Yeah. Like you read this

468
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,520
Speaker 3:  piece, we, we talked last week about knowing people's bylines. You read this

469
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,280
Speaker 3:  piece, it's Sean Hollister just like Yes. Yes. All the way through. It's

470
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,110
Speaker 3:  great and the exasperation that comes through. Yeah because

471
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,910
Speaker 3:  what these ola panels when you use them as monitors do is

472
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,890
Speaker 3:  they, they dimm the entire panel when you have big fields of white

473
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,040
Speaker 3:  Right? Because they don't want to, as Alex is saying, you don't wanna, you

474
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,650
Speaker 3:  don't wanna blow out or burn in. So they dimm the entire

475
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,410
Speaker 3:  panel and Sean is like, the problem is all computer

476
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,260
Speaker 3:  interfaces are mostly white. so like he's like,

477
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,310
Speaker 3:  you can just feel his exasperation in this in this review.

478
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And he, he talked about babying the screen to not have that

479
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,960
Speaker 4:  happen and not get burn in And I. So felt that like the thing

480
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,900
Speaker 4:  you have where you know the potential problem and every time

481
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,460
Speaker 4:  it does that sort of artificial dimm you can feel yourself getting closer

482
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,320
Speaker 4:  to it and so you start to like, you start to just move things around on your

483
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,680
Speaker 4:  computer just to change the pixels and it's like I just, this is, I am thinking

484
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,150
Speaker 4:  about this monitor a lot more than feels necessary.

485
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,000
Speaker 3:  Yeah. There's also a perfect Sean moment in the review where he

486
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,790
Speaker 3:  puts an image slider in and the image slider is just his desk setup

487
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:13,460
Speaker 3:  with the old monitor and the new OLED monitor. They look exactly the same

488
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,240
Speaker 3:  and he is just excited that it's like exactly the same. It's great. You should

489
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,520
Speaker 3:  just read it. It's great And it's a,

490
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,440
Speaker 5:  It's a really good piece. You're gonna like, you're gonna

491
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,100
Speaker 5:  get FOMO reading it 'cause you're gonna want it even though he like points

492
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,880
Speaker 5:  out every single flaw in it. Yeah. And I think it's should be like a call

493
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,850
Speaker 5:  to arm action for Windows and, and

494
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,780
Speaker 5:  Apple to like fix their shit.

495
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,360
Speaker 3:  We had another piece this week but Victoria's song about how smart watches

496
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,480
Speaker 3:  this year are super iterative and it's actually really interesting to, to

497
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,000
Speaker 3:  read those things together 'cause the iterative smartwatch is boring, right?

498
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,520
Speaker 3:  Right. Like here's some minor updates to the Samsung watches. We've made

499
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,030
Speaker 3:  the letters unsettlingly huge and added teeth to the displays

500
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,960
Speaker 3:  fine. We think the Apple watch is gonna be super iterative this

501
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,800
Speaker 3:  year. Fine. That's the boring iterative what Sean's

502
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,590
Speaker 3:  monitor piece is like this is the best kind of iterative.

503
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,360
Speaker 3:  Like you start with let's put an OLED TV on your desk and here's all the

504
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,090
Speaker 3:  problems and here's like the last step

505
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,930
Speaker 3:  before the next iteration when this idea is complete. Yeah. And this is almost

506
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:19,680
Speaker 3:  the most exciting version of a product, right? Like yeah if you're into

507
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,650
Speaker 3:  gadgets, this one right when you can clearly and

508
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,250
Speaker 3:  okay it's And I think Sean list, like fix these three things in

509
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,690
Speaker 3:  this category is ready. Like there's something really excited about that

510
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,570
Speaker 3:  version of the iterative process versus the sort of like end state of

511
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,510
Speaker 3:  phones that we appear to be in.

512
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,370
Speaker 5:  And it's nice to see it's happen kind of fast or feels fast to

513
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,202
Speaker 5:  me 'cause we were seeing our first Ola displays what, 20 15, 20

514
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,050
Speaker 5:  16? I think it was like the earliest ones and it didn't work because when

515
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,810
Speaker 5:  you shrink down big TV technology, it's actually really hard to shrink that

516
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,390
Speaker 5:  down into a monitor that makes sense close to your face.

517
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,690
Speaker 5:  That's why the two technologies aren't in lock sync at all

518
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,950
Speaker 5:  times. And it's, and they're starting to figure it out. They're starting

519
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,770
Speaker 5:  to invest in it and, and and really sort it out and people are

520
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,290
Speaker 5:  buying it, which is also good 'cause then the prices will hopefully go down

521
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,960
Speaker 5:  and we can all buy them.

522
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,650
Speaker 3:  Yeah. These are Sean's three things by the way. 100 nets of sustained

523
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,330
Speaker 3:  brightness, which is related to that dimming issue. A warranty

524
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,170
Speaker 3:  update because the warranty doesn't cover burning, which is and a

525
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,600
Speaker 3:  decent sale to your point Alex.

526
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,250
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The hundred nets of extra brightness is gonna be like, that's gonna

527
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,070
Speaker 5:  be a real challenge 'cause that's, that's where OLED always falls is

528
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,010
Speaker 5:  is on brightness. It's, it's where it struggles. And so I'll

529
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,530
Speaker 5:  be really curious to see how they do that and if they do that and when they

530
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:42,480
Speaker 5:  do that. But man I'm excited. Like Sean got me super hyped for this.

531
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,080
Speaker 4:  I think it's great 'cause we're, we're definitely on this path of convergence

532
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,940
Speaker 4:  between small TVs and computer monitors in a way that I think is really

533
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,520
Speaker 4:  fun. Especially 'cause like I I, my assumption is this is

534
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,960
Speaker 4:  driven by people who sit at desks and play video

535
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,840
Speaker 4:  games and want, want something that looks like a TV and

536
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,680
Speaker 4:  a computer monitor in one screen and there are more and more of those people

537
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,160
Speaker 4:  all the time. And this is the kind of thing that is sitting right at the

538
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,960
Speaker 4:  middle of that And I think like Samsung's doing all kinds of wild stuff with

539
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,560
Speaker 4:  like a smart TV in one input and the other input it's computer monitor. I

540
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,370
Speaker 4:  think that's very cool. But like ole is the, is the right answer,

541
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,480
Speaker 4:  right When we get it right it's gonna be ol lead. Yeah and it does, it feels

542
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,900
Speaker 4:  like we're just around the corner from that in a very cool way. It's

543
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,980
Speaker 5:  So close.

544
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,840
Speaker 4:  I'm pumped to have like a 32 inch computer monitor slash television just

545
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,160
Speaker 4:  sitting on my desk. It's gonna be amazing. I cannot wait and it's

546
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,640
Speaker 5:  Gonna be the most I I mean. I think there's still gonna be some challenges

547
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,740
Speaker 5:  there, particularly around d r 'cause right

548
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,680
Speaker 5:  now the software side of H D R sucks still like,

549
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,440
Speaker 5:  like Microsoft and Apple just aren't doing it very well. The game companies

550
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,300
Speaker 5:  aren't doing it very well. Nobody's kind of figured it out and and settled

551
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,200
Speaker 5:  on something consistent and pleasing to the eyeballs. And

552
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,780
Speaker 5:  so I think we're still gonna, that's where it's gonna start to lag for full

553
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,640
Speaker 5:  TV replacement. But most people probably don't care about H D R

554
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,560
Speaker 5:  as much as I do. So most people will probably be fine. It's

555
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,920
Speaker 5:  just gonna be like me and Sean over in a corner being like, oh H D R is still

556
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,440
Speaker 5:  not up to snuff and that's okay. We're gonna have a great time over around

557
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:09,920
Speaker 5:  corner.

558
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,080
Speaker 4:  Alright Mila, what's yours?

559
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,000
Speaker 3:  I have two on the Vision Pro, which we haven't talked about in a while. So

560
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,240
Speaker 3:  Apple's virtual reality headset, which they really do not wanna call a virtual

561
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,160
Speaker 3:  reality headset. So one is a little one, they have

562
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,120
Speaker 3:  opened up developer registrations and testing. So

563
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,960
Speaker 3:  Mark Erman has some screenshots of the process. You developers need to go

564
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,880
Speaker 3:  through, sign up for this, you pick a headband size, you pick a light seal

565
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,360
Speaker 3:  size, you have to go in physically to their testing centers. You get fitted,

566
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,300
Speaker 3:  you get lenses and you can try your apps on it. That's a lot.

567
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,120
Speaker 3:  And he also reported, and I'm just gonna quote, here's Mark Garman at

568
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,880
Speaker 3:  Bloomberg Hearing so far that the vision pro developer labs to test apps

569
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,710
Speaker 3:  and actual hardware have been underfilled with small amounts of developers.

570
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,510
Speaker 3:  Some developers are emphasizing companies not offering any East Coast sessions.

571
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,400
Speaker 3:  Cupertino is the only option for the entire United States. This makes sense

572
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,270
Speaker 3:  to me. I just wanna be clear about that. This product is so complicated.

573
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:06,240
Speaker 3:  They have to fit it to you that you of course are starting as small as

574
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,060
Speaker 3:  you can before you like roll it out at scale. Also

575
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,680
Speaker 3:  no one knows what to build for this thing. Yeah. So it just, it doesn't surprise

576
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,520
Speaker 3:  me that development is starting slow, but that's a note I And, I think

577
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,360
Speaker 3:  it's obvious it's gonna start slow. What's equally interesting to me is that

578
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,040
Speaker 3:  coming up in September is Meta Connect where they're probably

579
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,860
Speaker 3:  gonna announce the Oculus Quest three, which is a

580
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,660
Speaker 3:  scaled, you know, sells as many units. The, the Quest line

581
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,360
Speaker 3:  has sold as many units as any game console. So you, you kinda have the two

582
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,240
Speaker 3:  things happening in parallel. Apple's starting very small with

583
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,160
Speaker 3:  a larger base of developers. It's like pretty excited meta already

584
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,080
Speaker 3:  having application and like installed

585
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,040
Speaker 3:  base scale with the Quest. I think I know

586
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,480
Speaker 3:  what's gonna happen. I I think Apple's gonna be very successful with the

587
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,440
Speaker 3:  Vision Pro and you know, compared to the Quest, but I, who knows it's very

588
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,780
Speaker 3:  expensive compared to the Quest, but they're starting really, really small.

589
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,000
Speaker 3:  Do

590
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,750
Speaker 5:  You think there's gonna be like a little like Shadow Apple

591
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,710
Speaker 5:  developer conference around Connect because you have all of those developers

592
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,390
Speaker 5:  down there near Cupertino. Do you think something's like that's gonna happen?

593
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:14,680
Speaker 5:  Well

594
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,650
Speaker 4:  That's also presumably only a couple of weeks

595
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:21,630
Speaker 4:  after Apple's big fall event where I suspect

596
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:25,040
Speaker 4:  it will have a lot to say about things like the Vision Pro,

597
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,830
Speaker 4:  right?

598
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,540
Speaker 3:  I don't know. I think the fall event for Apple looks like the iPhone.

599
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,250
Speaker 3:  Sure. Maybe a Mac and they say nothing about the Vision

600
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,920
Speaker 3:  Pro, it's unreleased headset with no developer support thus far.

601
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,790
Speaker 4:  Maybe, although I don't know. I I I have two competing feelings about this.

602
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,330
Speaker 4:  On the one hand, I think you're exactly right that Apple is starting small

603
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:47,190
Speaker 4:  in every way. It's gonna run most iPad apps right outta the box. So in that

604
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,370
Speaker 4:  sense it's just like, it's just gonna work and everybody will like check

605
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:54,100
Speaker 4:  the checkbox to make it work on the Vision Pro and do the clicky interface.

606
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,390
Speaker 4:  It's

607
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,940
Speaker 5:  Gonna work like your iPad works with iPhone apps.

608
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,780
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And think about how many apps did that, right? Like that's that Yeah.

609
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,510
Speaker 4:  Will get you through a year or two. And then I think we're gonna get to the

610
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,030
Speaker 4:  point where a lot of these folks start to turn and say, okay, what can this

611
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,870
Speaker 4:  thing be? But I, I was really surprised after the

612
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,470
Speaker 4:  launch just pulling developers I talked to and the number of them who were

613
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,870
Speaker 4:  like, yeah, we'll probably end up doing something, but at this moment it

614
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,950
Speaker 4:  doesn't really feel like a priority for us. So I think there's gonna be an

615
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,570
Speaker 4:  interesting like chicken and egg thing going on over the next six months.

616
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,910
Speaker 4:  And don don't really know how that's gonna shake out. Yeah,

617
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,900
Speaker 5:  I feel like Apple probably needs to be a little, like

618
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,830
Speaker 5:  they need to be more proactive. I, I get, I totally get why they're not that

619
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,710
Speaker 5:  makes a lot of sense. But at the same time if everybody's looking at your

620
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,270
Speaker 5:  product willingly and like are like is this a total boondoggle? Is this the

621
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,270
Speaker 5:  Apple boondoggle you probably do wanna be a little aggressive with with getting

622
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,150
Speaker 5:  some really cool killer apps on there and in courting those developers who

623
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,990
Speaker 5:  aren't necessarily based in Cupertino or near to Cupertino to come out

624
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,430
Speaker 5:  and and try it out.

625
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,570
Speaker 3:  I think I just think they got time. I like Yeah, that's true. If in order

626
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,510
Speaker 3:  to try this thing out you need to sit down, have it fitted to

627
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,740
Speaker 3:  your head and special lenses made for your glass,

628
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,670
Speaker 3:  like that is just a slow expensive process that you

629
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,270
Speaker 3:  are gonna try to refine and optimize as much as you can before you

630
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,660
Speaker 3:  like put them in every Apple store. Yeah. And I. I think that's like their

631
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,330
Speaker 3:  first problem. I think this is the inherent problem with every

632
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:22,100
Speaker 3:  face computer is that you have to wear them on your face. Yeah. And then

633
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,860
Speaker 3:  I think the bigger problem is that Apple itself outside of what

634
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,720
Speaker 3:  if we did cool N B A things has not really demoed a killer

635
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,490
Speaker 3:  app. you know, like the killer app that I hear people

636
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,470
Speaker 3:  talk about is I'm standing at my desk mirroring my Mac Yeah.

637
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,360
Speaker 3:  Onto five G anti virtual displays and it's like, ugh, that's not

638
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,200
Speaker 3:  good enough. you know, like it that's cool.

639
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,240
Speaker 4:  I mean that's not nothing but that's not, that doesn't get Apple where it

640
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,850
Speaker 4:  thinks it's going here. But

641
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,360
Speaker 5:  Isn't that why you wanna court developers is because maybe one of them has

642
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,360
Speaker 5:  the really good idea that's the killer app. Yeah, but

643
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,710
Speaker 3:  You gotta know, you gotta know what your courting That's true.

644
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,520
Speaker 3:  Like you, you can't just be swiping right on all the

645
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,240
Speaker 3:  developers to take this courtship metaphor in a horrible

646
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,800
Speaker 3:  direction. You can't, you gotta, you gotta have a type, I don't know

647
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,780
Speaker 4:  I mean we had years of fart apps and beer pouring before everybody figured

648
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,120
Speaker 4:  out the iPhone app store like, but the difference there was that a lot of

649
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,680
Speaker 4:  people were able to get it and use it and say, oh I understand new things

650
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,550
Speaker 4:  I can do with this. The challenge with this is gonna be that it's really

651
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,840
Speaker 4:  expensive. Their by all accounts aren't gonna be that many of

652
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,800
Speaker 4:  them. It's gonna be super complicated to get set up for

653
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,560
Speaker 4:  and start using. And so just the like the hurdles to getting one in your

654
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,000
Speaker 4:  hands so that you can start to dream about what it might be for are just

655
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,880
Speaker 4:  so much higher than anything Apple has built before that. I wonder how it

656
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,230
Speaker 4:  will change things.

657
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:41,710
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

658
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,680
Speaker 3:  Yeah. By the way, that far type era is really instructive, right? 'cause

659
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,200
Speaker 3:  everyone jokes about it. Remember that app? I am Rich Redownload an app and

660
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,760
Speaker 3:  you could just like, it

661
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,120
Speaker 4:  Cost a thousand dollars, right? Wasn't that the thing? It was,

662
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,280
Speaker 3:  I think it might have been more, I think it might been like a hundred thousand

663
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,520
Speaker 3:  dollars, but there was an app called I'm Rich where you could download it

664
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,360
Speaker 3:  and you could hit a button and pay a bunch of money to the developer and

665
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,100
Speaker 3:  it would just put up a badge that said, I'm Rich. One of the greatest ideas

666
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,880
Speaker 3:  for an application in all of history agreed. Like just truly one of the greatest

667
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,240
Speaker 3:  ideas for an application in all of history. And Apple is like, we can't have

668
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,200
Speaker 3:  this. It's a joke. The fart app are joke. And if you just think about where

669
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,840
Speaker 3:  we've come, the two categories that have succeeded and

670
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,520
Speaker 3:  driven the iPhone are social networking and free to play

671
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,860
Speaker 3:  games. Yeah. Yeah. And everything else is kind of around it, right? Like

672
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,680
Speaker 3:  the Ubers and Lyfts of the world are revolutions in their way, but they're

673
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,370
Speaker 3:  just kind of a duopoly that is stagnant. Like all the other

674
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,080
Speaker 3:  stuff to pales in comparison the size of free to play games and social

675
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,040
Speaker 3:  networking apps. And it's hard to see even what the fart

676
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,620
Speaker 3:  apps look like on the $3,500 Vision Pro.

677
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,820
Speaker 5:  I was gonna say, what, what is, what is the the Fart app equivalent gonna

678
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,700
Speaker 5:  be on a face computer? All

679
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,500
Speaker 3:  Right, that's a reader email send us your ideas. Yes, let us know. I'm actually

680
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,180
Speaker 3:  very curious and And, I'm confident that many of our readers have Oculus

681
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,000
Speaker 3:  Quests. They have PS vrs. Tell us what you think the fart apps

682
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,940
Speaker 3:  are gonna be and what you think the tos are gonna be of the

683
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,860
Speaker 3:  Vision Pro. Love

684
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,420
Speaker 4:  That. Because

685
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,180
Speaker 3:  I, I, I truly cannot tell you the answer. And I. I also have a PSS V R two.

686
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,100
Speaker 3:  I don't think Grand Touro VR is going to be the TikTok of

687
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,180
Speaker 3:  the Vision Pro as much as I want it to be. I don't think that's gonna happen.

688
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,180
Speaker 4:  I don't think so either. Neil, what's your other one? So

689
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,020
Speaker 3:  The other one is my other favorite story of the week. Another just

690
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,150
Speaker 3:  perfect Verge story. It's a format

691
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,960
Speaker 3:  Waral Apple announced the Vision Pro platform

692
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,940
Speaker 3:  is going to join the alliance for open U S D, which is

693
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,840
Speaker 3:  a standards body that's developing interoperable three D tools

694
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,530
Speaker 3:  and file formats. That's Nvidia, Adobe, Autodesk,

695
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:40,270
Speaker 3:  Pixar. They're basically developing interoperable three D tools, file

696
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,640
Speaker 3:  formats, here's the object formats, here's how they're defined. You can move

697
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,000
Speaker 3:  them between these platforms. You can manipulate them between these platforms.

698
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,870
Speaker 3:  I love this. It also means that the apps you use like

699
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,550
Speaker 3:  Maya Houdini, Autodesk three s, Max, Adobe Substance, three D designers,

700
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,880
Speaker 3:  they can interoperate, they can use the same files. Nvidia can accelerate

701
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,160
Speaker 3:  these graphics. This is notably one of the first times you see Apple and

702
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,160
Speaker 3:  Nvidia working together and they obviously have common purpose in doing so,

703
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,360
Speaker 3:  which is surprising. These companies have not historically liked each

704
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,960
Speaker 3:  other. But what's funny is there's

705
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,830
Speaker 3:  another standards group, there's the Metaverse

706
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,380
Speaker 3:  standards forum, which has Epic and meta in it and like

707
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,230
Speaker 3:  they're also working with U S D, they've got working groups to like look

708
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,190
Speaker 3:  at this file format. But here we are. We we did it.

709
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,990
Speaker 3:  We did H G D V D and Blu-Ray again for the metaverse. I'm so

710
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,810
Speaker 3:  happy. It seems like I'm guessing U S D is gonna

711
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:36,070
Speaker 3:  become the basis of a lot of things just given the people who are supporting

712
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,840
Speaker 3:  it. But this Notion that the

713
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,670
Speaker 3:  three D internet, the metaverse should have interoperable

714
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,590
Speaker 3:  file formats that sort of every computer can use and all these

715
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,520
Speaker 3:  applications can

716
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,470
Speaker 3:  manipulate this big idea. Everyone agrees

717
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,310
Speaker 3:  it's a good idea. They keep calling it like H T M L for three D, it's far

718
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,870
Speaker 3:  from subtle. Like there's a long way from here to there. And so you just

719
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,590
Speaker 3:  see like every other standard, everyone agrees, oh all these computers should

720
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,490
Speaker 3:  use HT M i, all these t v HTM I, who's gonna be in charge of

721
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,100
Speaker 3:  HTM I C E C and should that work well And the answer's like Don

722
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,910
Speaker 3:  more. We'll

723
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,370
Speaker 3:  see.

724
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,830
Speaker 4:  So what to that point, what, what is the right metaphor for this? Because

725
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:22,110
Speaker 4:  I was trying to figure this out like is it, should we talk about U S D, the

726
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,990
Speaker 4:  way we talk about like coding languages like JavaScript or H T

727
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,110
Speaker 4:  ml and the fact that that works across lots of apps. Should we talk about

728
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,910
Speaker 4:  it like PDFs or JPEGs like file formats that

729
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,910
Speaker 4:  everybody kind of agrees to understand? I

730
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:38,600
Speaker 5:  Was thinking of like video containers, not even

731
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,390
Speaker 5:  Codex containers. Okay. Like the A V I

732
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,850
Speaker 5:  versus MP four kind of generation of things. Okay.

733
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:49,730
Speaker 4:  And that turned into a gigantic mess. So that's discouraging. Yeah.

734
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,490
Speaker 5:  And then V L C came and saved us all. Yeah,

735
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,220
Speaker 3:  Here's the description from Nvidia, which is technical but

736
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,930
Speaker 3:  easy to understand. Open U S D supports the requirements of building virtual

737
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,910
Speaker 3:  worlds like geometry, cameras, lights and materials. It also

738
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,830
Speaker 3:  includes features necessary for scaling to complex data sets. And it's tremendously

739
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,350
Speaker 3:  extensible enabling the technology to adapt it to workflows beyond visual

740
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,870
Speaker 3:  effects. So you've got a three D scene, you need to describe some objects

741
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,690
Speaker 3:  in it, the materials and textures of those objects where the cameras

742
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,700
Speaker 3:  are the geometry of the scene itself.

743
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,510
Speaker 3:  Like that's just a lot of data structures that you

744
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,990
Speaker 3:  can standardize.

745
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,430
Speaker 4:  So that sounds like coding language to me

746
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:31,190
Speaker 3:  That's more like file. It's like you have a word file and it has some structured

747
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,720
Speaker 3:  data that describes the font and the the line breaks and the whatever and

748
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,600
Speaker 3:  then the sort of the text is standardized dot doc by the way or dot

749
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,390
Speaker 3:  Doc X one of the most controversial file

750
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,370
Speaker 3:  formats of all time, right? Because it's just text. But

751
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,280
Speaker 3:  until a while ago it was a proprietary

752
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,260
Speaker 3:  file format. so like you just got this like issue where you have these

753
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,500
Speaker 3:  proprietary file formats, people developing them and then you've got files

754
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,940
Speaker 3:  that only that application can read. And that creates tremendous lock-in.

755
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,860
Speaker 3:  I think this industry is saying, okay, that's bad. We, we know

756
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,580
Speaker 3:  that's bad for a huge number of reasons, particularly consumer

757
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,380
Speaker 3:  adoption, right? Like you want, if you believe the

758
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,240
Speaker 3:  Matthew Balls of the world that the metaverse will enable you

759
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,190
Speaker 3:  to drop into the already created three D world of a

760
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,900
Speaker 3:  Pixar movie and like swing a lightsaber

761
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,860
Speaker 3:  around the, the thing that the Pixar animators are

762
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,590
Speaker 3:  working in has to be all the way back compatible to the Vision Pro,

763
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,450
Speaker 3:  right? Otherwise you have to go and remake, you have to

764
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:38,420
Speaker 3:  redo that work in the Vision Pros format. And that I think everybody

765
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,330
Speaker 3:  understands that. That seems like a huge waste of money.

766
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:43,660
Speaker 4:  Well this is the kind of thing you do when the industry is small and you're

767
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,480
Speaker 4:  still in the like rising tide lifts all boats phase of things

768
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,250
Speaker 4:  and when this gets bigger and there's more money in

769
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:55,140
Speaker 4:  walling off your, your walled garden like it for that reason, it's not

770
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,100
Speaker 4:  surprising to me that meta is not part of this, right? Like meta has more

771
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,860
Speaker 4:  reason to say we don't need to be compatible. People are already doing our

772
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,740
Speaker 4:  thing than, yep, some others. And I would not be shocked

773
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,520
Speaker 4:  if this becomes more contentious over time for that reason. Oh

774
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,050
Speaker 5:  Man, I really hope they become competing file

775
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,960
Speaker 5:  formats, And I really hope how they open and

776
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,160
Speaker 5:  are broken for the normal consumer is more like

777
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,940
Speaker 5:  doc than it's like video because video files you try to open it just

778
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,180
Speaker 5:  wouldn't work. Whereas Doc, you'd open it and you'd

779
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,520
Speaker 3:  Like and you'd the weird characters,

780
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,700
Speaker 5:  What's happening here? And that's what I want. But like in a three D

781
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,870
Speaker 5:  space scrapped to my face. Yeah that just sounds

782
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,060
Speaker 5:  delightful in a weird way. Oh my god, I want it so

783
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,740
Speaker 3:  Bad. Alex wants to be like lost in a bad trip Laser B b texting while

784
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,970
Speaker 3:  driving.

785
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,100
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it that's great. But

786
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,900
Speaker 3:  You know, to that same point, you can see why Pixar is like, okay,

787
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,860
Speaker 3:  we spend millions, hundreds of millions of dollars creating the

788
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,460
Speaker 3:  world of cars and we wanna make a video game where you can race

789
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,700
Speaker 3:  around the cars track.

790
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,900
Speaker 5:  I don't want it, but yeah, well sure.

791
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,860
Speaker 3:  But then we can just re, we can just take all of that rendering work, all

792
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:05,690
Speaker 3:  of that scene modeling work and put it on the Vision Pro as a video

793
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,660
Speaker 3:  game. And if you don't have some common file formats like that becomes more

794
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,960
Speaker 3:  costly than it's worth. Right? And I, that's just like, that's one vision

795
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,400
Speaker 3:  of the sort of three D future. But you can see why Pixar

796
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,340
Speaker 3:  or Epic or Unreal, which are deep in Hollywood or making that

797
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,400
Speaker 3:  push now. Totally. By the way, lightning round has taken 45 minutes.

798
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,660
Speaker 4:  We should take a break. But first I just wanna say Neli, that anything that

799
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,420
Speaker 4:  allows me to drop into a Pixar movie with a lightsaber is a huge

800
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,020
Speaker 4:  technological

801
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,840
Speaker 3:  Victory and we should all be in favor of it. You

802
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,900
Speaker 3:  gotta go listen to the Matthew Ball episode of Decoder. This is like what

803
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,840
Speaker 3:  he was talking about the whole time. It's it. It is a fascinating vision

804
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Speaker 3:  of the future. I have no idea if it's a good idea. The good news is all that's

805
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,630
Speaker 3:  done by Disney. So is it possible? Maybe we'll see.

806
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:51,490
Speaker 3:  Alright, we have to take a break from this interminable lightning round.

807
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,800
Speaker 3:  We're gonna come back and read some reader emails. We'll be right

808
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,700
Speaker 3:  back.

809
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,260
Speaker 6:  You're okay, you're okay.

810
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,000
Speaker 7:  Wolves and dogs are pretty closely related. They actually

811
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,980
Speaker 7:  share 99.9% of their genetics

812
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,900
Speaker 8:  Yo sniffles.

813
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,240
Speaker 7:  But even when they're just a few months old, even when they're raised by

814
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,950
Speaker 7:  human scientists, wolves are pretty different from dogs.

815
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:22,920
Speaker 8:  They start biting you in the ears when you lying down. If you don't sit

816
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Speaker 8:  up fast enough and you hear this wonderful noises with

817
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,320
Speaker 8:  little and then they chomp you in the air and you're like,

818
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,540
Speaker 8:  oh.

819
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,840
Speaker 7:  And when they grow up, these differences get even

820
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,540
Speaker 7:  bigger. Dogs are our friends.

821
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,140
Speaker 3:  Wolves

822
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,380
Speaker 7:  Are hunters.

823
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,300
Speaker 8:  If I had a sore shoulder, I wouldn't go in with the adult

824
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,880
Speaker 8:  wolves, even if I had raised them because it could trigger their hunting

825
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,350
Speaker 8:  behavior.

826
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:51,260
Speaker 7:  This week on unexplainable, how did we get the nice friendly dogs

827
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,880
Speaker 7:  we know and love today from wolves? Follow

828
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,520
Speaker 7:  unexplainable wherever you listen for new episodes. Every

829
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,950
Speaker 7:  Wednesday

830
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,570
Speaker 9:  In the 1970s, the pill revolutionized reproductive

831
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,520
Speaker 9:  healthcare in the US and for over 50 years, it was

832
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,490
Speaker 9:  only available by prescription until last month when

833
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,210
Speaker 9:  the F D A did something big, it approved over the counter birth

834
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,370
Speaker 9:  control.

835
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,130
Speaker 10:  I was really excited first of all, but I was also not entirely surprised,

836
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,090
Speaker 10:  right? This is something that the field has been working on for over 20

837
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,130
Speaker 10:  years.

838
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:30,090
Speaker 9:  Reproductive justice advocates and doctors are excited, but some important

839
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,020
Speaker 9:  questions about price and accessibility remain. That's this week on the

840
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:44,110
Speaker 9:  weeds.

841
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,030
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. It's time for some reader emails. So we've been asking

842
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,850
Speaker 3:  for emails lately. It's been really fun reading them all. Please, keep sending

843
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,530
Speaker 3:  us emails. Vergecast at The Verge dot com. We love it. We asked a couple

844
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,570
Speaker 3:  weeks ago for people who are deep in the Samsung ecosystem to email

845
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,490
Speaker 3:  us. It has been a deluge,

846
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,200
Speaker 3:  And I. Just wanna call this out specifically. I've been asking for

847
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,910
Speaker 3:  years for people who are hardcore Android

848
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,880
Speaker 3:  gaming phone users to email us. We have never gotten one

849
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,590
Speaker 3:  email. I asked for people who use the Spen to email

850
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,470
Speaker 3:  us and we get like five a day. You're

851
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:23,220
Speaker 5:  Gonna get four emails tomorrow about the razor phone.

852
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,530
Speaker 5:  Just get ready.

853
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,470
Speaker 3:  I'm just saying, if you use an Android gaming phone to play

854
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,400
Speaker 3:  games, where are you? Because the Spen people are out

855
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,240
Speaker 3:  in force and we've just never heard from the gaming

856
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,580
Speaker 3:  in front people. Maybe they don't listen to The Vergecast, who

857
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,850
Speaker 3:  knows? But just there's your data point for today.

858
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:45,100
Speaker 3:  Okay, let's do some emails. I wanna start, I'm not gonna read this whole

859
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,160
Speaker 3:  one at all. I'm just gonna start with an email from someone named

860
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,780
Speaker 3:  Mo for this reason. They call themselves a

861
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,280
Speaker 3:  Samsung fanboy or quote a Sam boy. Yes.

862
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,440
Speaker 4:  And just threw it out there as if that's a thing that everyone knows, which

863
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,760
Speaker 4:  is just perfect.

864
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,160
Speaker 5:  It is now. Yeah.

865
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,050
Speaker 3:  So thank you for Sam. Boy. David, do you wanna read Randy's email?

866
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,540
Speaker 3:  Sure. We

867
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,240
Speaker 4:  Got an email from Randy that says, I'm one of those Samsung tablet

868
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,560
Speaker 4:  sickos and wanted to chime in. I really appreciate the extent to which, so

869
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,440
Speaker 3:  Sam Boys and Sickos already Yes, from the jump, incredible emails

870
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:16,900
Speaker 3:  to receive.

871
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,560
Speaker 4:  They've all really leaned into being Sickos And, I. Really appreciate it.

872
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,820
Speaker 4:  It says, I switched from having surface tablets to using a Samsung Galaxy

873
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:27,300
Speaker 4:  tab, SS seven plus. And the reason for that is one piece of software clip

874
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,140
Speaker 4:  studio paint. It went, which is like three words to mean the same

875
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,960
Speaker 4:  thing. But anyway,

876
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,340
Speaker 4:  It went from being a desktop only app to being available on Galaxy slash

877
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,660
Speaker 4:  Android. And now I could finally have a normal tablet experience and get

878
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:45,010
Speaker 4:  to be productive and creative doing illustration on the same slim tablet.

879
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,480
Speaker 4:  Obviously that means I'm using the Spen on it all the time. Thank you Samsung

880
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,670
Speaker 4:  for including it with the tablet and not requiring me to purchase it separately,

881
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,660
Speaker 4:  which is a very good Apple burn. Great job, Randy. Yeah, it's my laptop.

882
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,500
Speaker 4:  Really. I take it to work with me so I can have some videos going while I'm

883
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,260
Speaker 4:  at my desk. Pop open clip studio to do an illustration or get a doodle down

884
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,980
Speaker 4:  on paper, open up Kindle to read the newest mango volume. And when you need

885
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,620
Speaker 4:  to prepare a d d campaign, I'll snap over to Dex to better multitask at a

886
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,380
Speaker 4:  coffee shop and get it all done. It's the best mobile computer I've ever

887
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,160
Speaker 4:  had. And I. Didn't have to give Apple a penny. This person is

888
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,060
Speaker 4:  100% either a Samsung employee or should be a

889
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,860
Speaker 4:  Samsung employee. 'cause what That is the best pitch of all time for

890
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,010
Speaker 4:  Samsung devices.

891
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,000
Speaker 5:  Call Randy now. Yeah,

892
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,620
Speaker 4:  Or it's Dan Siefert, the only other Dex fan that I

893
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,440
Speaker 4:  know.

894
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,910
Speaker 5:  He just changed his name, his burner account.

895
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:37,820
Speaker 3:  Dandy Sefer. This is incredible. So first of all,

896
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,090
Speaker 3:  I just wanna start with the end there. I didn't have to give Apple a penny.

897
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:45,020
Speaker 3:  This is a real theme in the Samsung emails. Yeah. I

898
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:48,820
Speaker 3:  don't like Apple, so I'm in the Samsung ecosystem that

899
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,460
Speaker 3:  motivates more people than you could possibly imagine, at least from our

900
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,180
Speaker 3:  emails. Obviously this is self-selecting group, the people who chose to email

901
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,940
Speaker 3:  us about their love of Samsung, but there's a commonality

902
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,740
Speaker 3:  there, which is nobody wants to use Apple stuff. And that's here The

903
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,220
Speaker 3:  flip to Dex, that's the turn for this.

904
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:05,960
Speaker 4:  It's so good.

905
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,770
Speaker 5:  Oof. Yeah, that's, it's beautiful. I, I love it. We found him, the guy who

906
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,570
Speaker 5:  uses Dex. Thank you Randy.

907
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,420
Speaker 3:  He's a sicko, but

908
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,980
Speaker 4:  I also, I'll snap over to Dex to better multitask at a coffee shop and get

909
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,120
Speaker 4:  it all done. Does that imply that you're bringing a monitor and a keyboard

910
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,060
Speaker 4:  and mouse to a coffee shop plugging it in?

911
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,580
Speaker 5:  I can only hope so

912
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,280
Speaker 4:  I, yeah, that's the correct answer.

913
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,790
Speaker 3:  Or you've got the flippy cover thing. Every tablet is that tablet now.

914
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah, true. But I will say this makes the right case for Samsung stuff, right?

915
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,940
Speaker 4:  Like Samsung devices do more stuff than anybody

916
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,600
Speaker 4:  else's devices. Does it do it all super elegantly and

917
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,180
Speaker 4:  beautifully? No. Does it do it all?

918
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,750
Speaker 4:  Yes. Like it's,

919
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah, like it's somewhere in here I could be like, and then I go home And

920
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,920
Speaker 3:  I Mirror cast my LG tv. It's like, well you can do that. Yeah.

921
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,120
Speaker 3:  Get them options. Yeah. It also has an IR blaster for when I need to control

922
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,340
Speaker 3:  my mini split. Like, okay.

923
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,330
Speaker 4:  And there's something to that.

924
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:00,900
Speaker 3:  There is something to that. I will, I will note that there's a killer

925
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,210
Speaker 3:  app involved here, right? There's clip studio paint,

926
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:08,200
Speaker 3:  which if you don't have that killer app and it's only on the iPad

927
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,980
Speaker 3:  or it's only on a Windows computer, this all falls apart for you.

928
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,900
Speaker 3:  So next we have Mark who wrote to us. This is a tale of woe.

929
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,200
Speaker 3:  I'm just gonna put this out there. Mark says, I'm a UX designer. Pen displays

930
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,450
Speaker 3:  are helpful in my work. I realize I'm not typical,

931
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:25,820
Speaker 3:  which Mark my friend. You're not alone,

932
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,820
Speaker 3:  mark. Yeah. There's a community of UX designers using pen

933
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,670
Speaker 3:  displays. We'll hook you up with some subreddits. Mark says, I've

934
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,320
Speaker 3:  tried Samsung tablets and phones with Spens since the beginning of them.

935
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,250
Speaker 3:  The emoji I think of as the Dieter face with, you know, the line.

936
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:44,200
Speaker 3:  Just the line. I tried to like them. I use an iPad Pro

937
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,060
Speaker 3:  and a Wacom syn take 32 Pro Daily. Now I use a U S P

938
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:52,050
Speaker 3:  flash drives. So I'm not stuck in Apple's Cloud for my content. I'm done

939
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:55,900
Speaker 3:  with Samsung Galaxy tabs and notes. Wow. And then he

940
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,350
Speaker 3:  says I should be able to use any device, not this content, but the devices

941
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:02,250
Speaker 3:  don't last. Nothing's on my devices very long. I want the good

942
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,620
Speaker 3:  pens, which are apple and wack com. I try not to be a prisoner of

943
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,380
Speaker 3:  proprietary clouds. Pretty

944
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,440
Speaker 4:  Good. Yes.

945
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,160
Speaker 3:  That's a Verge cash shirt. That is, I, I want that shirt mark as a designer,

946
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,480
Speaker 3:  if you wanna design a, I'm not a prisoner proprietary cloud shirt for us.

947
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,420
Speaker 3:  We, we'll sell it and we'll, we'll throw you a cut. And then

948
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,500
Speaker 3:  I use an iPad to read or sketch comfortably. I use big screen sketch stuff.

949
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,220
Speaker 3:  Done. This is the counter argument, right, is the Samsung tablets can do

950
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,060
Speaker 3:  everything. People are really attracted to them. Again, my dream is

951
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:33,970
Speaker 3:  to edit the entire Verge by circling copy in red.

952
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,860
Speaker 3:  If you could make that happen for me, Google

953
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,590
Speaker 3:  Docs, I'm golden. I'll buy whatever tablet you

954
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,540
Speaker 3:  want, but then you actually do it. You're like, oh, this is like pretty wanky

955
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:47,420
Speaker 3:  Alex. I think this is like your E Ink tablet story. Yeah. Every month.

956
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,230
Speaker 3:  Like, this is my dream. I bought the newest one. Ugh. And

957
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,550
Speaker 3:  we like move on. It sucks. I love it.

958
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:57,390
Speaker 4:  I also think that model that he describes at the end is kind of a

959
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:01,130
Speaker 4:  great way to think about a lot of devices. I should be able to drive over

960
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,740
Speaker 4:  any device and not lose content. Love that. I want to use the good

961
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:08,270
Speaker 4:  pens. Love that. Don't be a prisoner. Proprietary clouds

962
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:11,950
Speaker 4:  excellent. And then I use big screens to get stuff done. Should also be a

963
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,330
Speaker 4:  verse t-shirt.

964
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:19,030
Speaker 3:  That's a mug. That's like a, you walk into the meeting and you put your mug

965
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:19,470
Speaker 3:  back. Its big

966
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,270
Speaker 4:  Screen get, so

967
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,200
Speaker 3:  I love it. That's great. All right, next we have an email from a, a reader

968
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,080
Speaker 3:  named Alexa. I'm gonna have my friend Alex read this

969
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,720
Speaker 3:  email and you decide it's not who actually sent this

970
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,030
Speaker 3:  email to us.

971
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,920
Speaker 5:  It's not me. I don't like the name Alexa because it's not my

972
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,640
Speaker 5:  name. And then the smart speaker always confuses

973
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,360
Speaker 5:  us. I got my Samsung Galaxy S

974
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,840
Speaker 5:  23 Ultra in March April time and was very excited for the

975
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,400
Speaker 5:  built-in SS pin. Felt like a real hark back to the old

976
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,220
Speaker 5:  Samsung champ I had as a young teen with a we stylist. Again,

977
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,220
Speaker 3:  You decide who Alexa is in this story.

978
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,170
Speaker 5:  Not me, but Alexa. We should be friends for the first

979
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,720
Speaker 5:  month or two. It was great. Used it often. Reconnected with my creative side

980
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,520
Speaker 5:  and doodled a bit, took notes in meetings. The usual stuff. The

981
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,150
Speaker 5:  killer app of the pen, however, lies in a more unconventional use case.

982
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:18,640
Speaker 5:  Seriously. Alexa, we can be besties. It is the absolute

983
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,420
Speaker 5:  perfect size to poke down joints.

984
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,840
Speaker 5:  Yes, the perfect, and this is bold. The

985
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,760
Speaker 5:  perfect width four or five months in the s pin is

986
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,640
Speaker 5:  used every single day. But I can't remember

987
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,330
Speaker 5:  the last time I touched the screen. A perfectly portable

988
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,090
Speaker 5:  pokey. Everywhere you go, it's there for you. I

989
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:43,960
Speaker 5:  gotta go get a Samsung Galaxy S 23 Ultra is what I

990
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,960
Speaker 5:  learned from this.

991
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,560
Speaker 4:  A perfectly portable pokey sounds like a sentence we can't say on this

992
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,440
Speaker 4:  show is very many times. I love this email. So much so

993
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:53,740
Speaker 4:  good.

994
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,480
Speaker 3:  I'm such an old man. I read this email. And I was like, or it's her elbow

995
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,400
Speaker 3:  hurt. Like is she just stabbing her

996
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,510
Speaker 3:  joints?

997
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,560
Speaker 5:  Very long, long. Look at it.

998
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,800
Speaker 4:  Listen, Samsung devices do all the things. Yeah, like you, you, you think

999
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,520
Speaker 4:  this isn't on a spec sheet somewhere in, yeah. South Korea. Come on. They,

1000
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,240
Speaker 4:  they know it's

1001
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,180
Speaker 5:  Important to, to get those, those joints rolled perfectly.

1002
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,180
Speaker 3:  All right. My request is we, we should transition away from the Samsung emails.

1003
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:23,080
Speaker 3:  Can we play Laser Bong as a transition song please?

1004
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,920
Speaker 3:  I can't see Andrew's face, but I think it's the dieter emoji sheet right

1005
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,880
Speaker 3:  now. All right, so we have a couple more. These are some of

1006
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,680
Speaker 3:  my favorites. So we've been asking for consumer wars, like

1007
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,370
Speaker 3:  product wars, fanboy wars, the rain X versus

1008
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:41,320
Speaker 3:  water versus other brands. Windshield

1009
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,100
Speaker 3:  washer fluid continues to rage in our emails. The Rain X people

1010
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,120
Speaker 3:  are furious that we've acknowledged anything

1011
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,640
Speaker 3:  else. They're very mad at us. Rain x bug wash. By

1012
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,240
Speaker 3:  far the, the fans are out of control. I was in the gas

1013
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,400
Speaker 3:  station recently. I needed to buy some Windshield washer fluid. I didn't,

1014
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,270
Speaker 3:  I just bought whatever was there. And I literally felt bad.

1015
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:06,040
Speaker 3:  That is the weirdest feeling I've ever had as a purchaser of anything. I

1016
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,680
Speaker 3:  was like, ah, it's not rain. And it's like they got to me. You just

1017
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,030
Speaker 5:  Vindicated all of them.

1018
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:14,000
Speaker 3:  Well no, that's just bullying. I don't think they just, I

1019
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,240
Speaker 3:  was just like, I felt, I felt weird about wearing the wrong shoes to elementary

1020
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,200
Speaker 3:  school. That was exactly that feeling. I do not think it is any more

1021
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,600
Speaker 3:  or less significant to my Windshield wiper performance.

1022
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,500
Speaker 3:  However, if you continue to have feelings, email us. I'm dying to know. Here's

1023
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,030
Speaker 3:  my favorite email of this entire Consumer

1024
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:35,930
Speaker 3:  Wars conversation. It might be one of the

1025
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,890
Speaker 3:  best emails we have ever gotten. It vindicates everything I know to be true

1026
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,630
Speaker 3:  about the Birch. So good. It's from Zachary. I

1027
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:47,050
Speaker 3:  run a pool cleaning service in Southern California. I have listened every

1028
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,630
Speaker 3:  week since the End Gadget podcast days. And I thought I would share

1029
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,370
Speaker 3:  the argument about which high-end carbon fiber pool pole is

1030
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:58,320
Speaker 3:  best. Yes. When you service pools all day long, your

1031
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,890
Speaker 3:  pole is your most used tool. Yeah, it's, they have been

1032
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:05,020
Speaker 3:  aluminum for decades, but in the last five

1033
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,850
Speaker 3:  years, carbon fiber has hit the scene. This

1034
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:12,710
Speaker 3:  is a huge upgrade causing less back strain during heavy

1035
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:16,150
Speaker 3:  use. And then he lists three

1036
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,940
Speaker 3:  categories. There's the wrong, there are

1037
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,540
Speaker 3:  those who only care about specs and they

1038
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,500
Speaker 3:  choose the primate pool pole. They think the only speck that

1039
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,940
Speaker 3:  matters is weight. They ignore a harder to use latch. The

1040
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,380
Speaker 3:  poorer construction and the inferior customer service.

1041
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,260
Speaker 4:  I just wanna say that the primate pool pole is not like a dig. That's

1042
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,440
Speaker 4:  the actual name of the product. That's

1043
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,300
Speaker 3:  The name of, and that's, and that's where you spec

1044
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,080
Speaker 3:  monsters. Then he lists the best.

1045
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,980
Speaker 3:  The hyper pole by ultimate pool tools is the vastly

1046
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,920
Speaker 3:  superior pole. Yes, it does weigh a few ounces more than the original,

1047
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,350
Speaker 3:  but that leaves out so much. The hyper pole has the cleverly named hyper

1048
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,100
Speaker 3:  drain that allows water collected in the pole to flat out instantly is removed

1049
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:06,480
Speaker 3:  from the water. The weight savings from the other pole is quickly outdone

1050
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,380
Speaker 3:  by the water weight savings compared with the better latches and the great

1051
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,110
Speaker 3:  customer service. Easy decision. Yeah. This man is furious

1052
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:17,020
Speaker 3:  about pool poles. And I love it. And then that's so good. We get to the

1053
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,970
Speaker 3:  silly, this is his label. This is the

1054
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,220
Speaker 3:  poll that would've been released by Will. I am

1055
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,690
Speaker 4:  Incredible. This is the best part of this whole email.

1056
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:26,280
Speaker 3:  Like

1057
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,750
Speaker 4:  That tells you everything you need to know and is also will I AM's legacy

1058
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,000
Speaker 4:  And that makes me so happy.

1059
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,890
Speaker 3:  Just wait until you hear this description. The Skimm

1060
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:40,270
Speaker 3:  light carbon light is needed by no one and

1061
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,760
Speaker 3:  solves no problems.

1062
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,710
Speaker 3:  Instead of a tried and true circular tube.

1063
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:51,570
Speaker 3:  It is a 10 sided deagon preventing you

1064
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:55,210
Speaker 3:  from spinning it in your hand. It also has pre-drilled set

1065
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:58,830
Speaker 3:  points only allowing it to click into place in certain spots.

1066
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:00,990
Speaker 4:  End of email point made it's silly.

1067
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,730
Speaker 3:  End, end of email. We reached out back to Zachary. I'm

1068
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:08,490
Speaker 3:  dying to find the forums where this is all being argued out. If you

1069
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:12,330
Speaker 3:  wanna write 5,000 words about the introduction of

1070
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:15,930
Speaker 3:  carbon fiber into the pool industry and how it's torn

1071
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:19,240
Speaker 3:  that industry apart, just email me

1072
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,070
Speaker 3:  anytime. We will commission that story anytime. I

1073
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:26,930
Speaker 3:  love it. I love that this exists. This is the, like in many ways the purpose

1074
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,900
Speaker 3:  of the internet is allowing people to be their best selves.

1075
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,850
Speaker 3:  Arguing about carbon fiber pool tools.

1076
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:37,610
Speaker 5:  Oh my god, these tools are so expensive. They're so expensive. They're

1077
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,900
Speaker 5:  so expensive.

1078
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,580
Speaker 3:  It's so good. Read some read surprises. Alex.

1079
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,550
Speaker 5:  Okay, so the the the the hyper pole. That's the

1080
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:50,070
Speaker 5:  good one. Yeah, that's 2 75. 2 75. That's the one you five, that's the one

1081
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,230
Speaker 5:  you want. It's 2 75 and it's great. It's also sold out. Looks

1082
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,510
Speaker 4:  Like a lights saber by the way. Huge fan. I would

1083
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:59,430
Speaker 5:  Get no work done with this. The, the primate three

1084
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:03,421
Speaker 5:  x ranges from 2 54 99

1085
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:07,740
Speaker 5:  to 3 24 99. Which is

1086
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,560
Speaker 5:  just,

1087
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,180
Speaker 3:  I'm telling you,

1088
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,953
Speaker 5:  I think that's the special edition. Kevlar Weave. No, that's only 2 99.

1089
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,020
Speaker 5:  Is it the Teal Tiki also 2 99. It's

1090
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,160
Speaker 5:  good. I'm trying to figure out which one is so expensive.

1091
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,820
Speaker 3:  I'm saying if you are a budding reporter or

1092
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:27,730
Speaker 3:  journalist out there and you're like I can nail this

1093
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:31,610
Speaker 3:  feature about the, the war that has taken over

1094
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:35,330
Speaker 3:  the pool cleaning industry because of carbon fiber. Hit us up. Send me a

1095
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,850
Speaker 3:  note. Send me a pitch. We'll run that story First slot in the

1096
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:42,090
Speaker 3:  hero, we'll send it to the awards. I'll send that story to the Pulitzer

1097
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,960
Speaker 3:  committee. You just let me know.

1098
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,620
Speaker 4:  Alex, I found the most expensive primate poll. It's the psycho

1099
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:51,320
Speaker 4:  Chimp one and it means the poll is decorated

1100
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,920
Speaker 4:  with what look like bored ape NFTs. Basically

1101
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,560
Speaker 4:  it's, this is so spectacular.

1102
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,090
Speaker 3:  Alright, we gotta get off pool tools. I'm just saying if you want to write

1103
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,370
Speaker 3:  that story, just hit me up. Alright, we got two more. They're

1104
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:05,800
Speaker 3:  both a plus. David, you wanna take the next one?

1105
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,530
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Neli. This one I think is, is directed especially to you. This is

1106
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:12,920
Speaker 4:  from Jonathan says there are two big manufacturers of premium

1107
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,600
Speaker 4:  woodworking hand tools in North America. Yes. La

1108
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,930
Speaker 4:  Nielsen and Lee Valley slash

1109
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:22,880
Speaker 4:  Veritas. you know those the big brands?

1110
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,570
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. Lai Nielsen mostly makes

1111
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,450
Speaker 4:  souped up versions of hundred year olds. Stanley designs Lee Valley slash

1112
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:34,250
Speaker 4:  Veritas make more modern takes on traditional tools with adventurous designs

1113
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,850
Speaker 4:  and materials. You can instantly tell why there's a huge like holy war between

1114
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:41,590
Speaker 4:  these two companies by the way. Like yeah. Cool versions of the old thing

1115
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:44,630
Speaker 4:  or new ideas like Hmm those those said never like each other

1116
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:47,970
Speaker 4:  Anyway. Lionel is preferred by the well-heeled

1117
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,410
Speaker 4:  traditionalist Lee Valley tools could be at home on the robo

1118
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:54,880
Speaker 4:  workbench in the bat cave hand tool specific.

1119
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,730
Speaker 3:  When I think of Batman, by the way, I think of premium handcrafted woodwork

1120
01:01:58,730 --> 01:01:59,560
Speaker 3:  game.

1121
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,950
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's amazing.

1122
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:01,490
Speaker 5:  That's how he

1123
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:04,610
Speaker 4:  Gets his belt hand tool. Jonathan continues there please. There's lots more

1124
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:08,370
Speaker 4:  Jonathan to get through there. Hand tool specific vaporware

1125
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:12,330
Speaker 4:  bonus. Several years ago lying this in showed a sample of a plow plane

1126
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:15,410
Speaker 4:  they were seeking to manufacture. It was based on the highly collectible

1127
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:19,240
Speaker 4:  miller patent plow plan. That's a fun phrase to say. The internet message

1128
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,760
Speaker 4:  boards went crazy. Of course. And nothing. Lion

1129
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,320
Speaker 4:  Nielsen stopped showing the sample. Eventually if you asked about it at one

1130
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,040
Speaker 4:  of their traveling tool shows, the presenter would give you a dirty look

1131
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,880
Speaker 4:  and ignore the question. Yes. We are talking about a tool that

1132
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,720
Speaker 4:  only makes inset grooves in boards. Yes. This is something you can do

1133
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,560
Speaker 4:  with any $99 router with speed and precision. Yes. Lee Valley has

1134
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,800
Speaker 4:  since released three different plow prs ranging in price from

1135
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,640
Speaker 4:  $160 to $440 before additional cutters or

1136
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,520
Speaker 4:  specific attachments End of email. Amazing.

1137
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:50,640
Speaker 3:  I

1138
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,750
Speaker 5:  Would absolutely buy one. Yeah.

1139
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,270
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1140
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,870
Speaker 5:  Just look at this old thing. It's cool.

1141
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,880
Speaker 3:  Well you can't get it. It's vaporware. I

1142
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,470
Speaker 5:  Know, but I would if, if I could.

1143
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:03,400
Speaker 3:  Okay. I just wanna unpack this email for one second. In order to know

1144
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,100
Speaker 3:  this information, people have to go out and get it. So for example,

1145
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,360
Speaker 3:  the sentence, the message boards went crazy and then

1146
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:14,030
Speaker 3:  nothing implies quite a bit of

1147
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:17,970
Speaker 3:  monitoring of message boards. Just putting that out there.

1148
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:21,510
Speaker 3:  Second, they stopped showing the sample. If you asked about it at one of

1149
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:25,470
Speaker 3:  their traveling tool shows you would get a dirty look and ignore the

1150
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:29,390
Speaker 3:  question implies that multiple people at

1151
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:33,020
Speaker 3:  multiple tool shows in multiple

1152
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:36,500
Speaker 3:  locations asked about this tool and received a dirty

1153
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:40,060
Speaker 3:  look and then collated that information on the

1154
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,690
Speaker 3:  internet such that it is now a fact.

1155
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,360
Speaker 4:  This is the Snyder cut of hand tools.

1156
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,460
Speaker 3:  I'm just saying it's so good. That's incredible. The, the people who do this

1157
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:53,220
Speaker 3:  are Taylor Swift fans waiting to see when 1989 Taylor's version

1158
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:57,180
Speaker 3:  will come out and fans of the plow claim incredible from Lee Nelson. I

1159
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:57,260
Speaker 3:  love

1160
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:00,820
Speaker 4:  It. I just love that everyone is the same. If you use a tool long

1161
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:04,580
Speaker 4:  enough, like this is why the version is obsessed with like mechanical

1162
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:07,620
Speaker 4:  keyboards and ole screens because that's what we like touch and look at all

1163
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:11,060
Speaker 4:  day. But if you touch and look at plow planes all day, you're gonna get dis

1164
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:15,020
Speaker 4:  obsessed about plow plans. I love it. Everyone is the same. You are all our

1165
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:15,480
Speaker 4:  people.

1166
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,020
Speaker 3:  Do you think the lie Nelson people are like forum bombing here? Like we have

1167
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,340
Speaker 3:  three of 'em ranging in price that Batman could use

1168
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:25,180
Speaker 3:  'em. All

1169
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,380
Speaker 3:  right, one more. When I think of Verge

1170
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,340
Speaker 3:  stories, you all know how obsessed I'm with Google and

1171
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,090
Speaker 3:  Zelda, the combo platter of Google and Zelda Alex. You wanna take this one?

1172
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:36,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1173
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,020
Speaker 5:  So this one's from John. He loves the show. Hey John, we love

1174
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:43,700
Speaker 5:  you and your most recent Friday episode, you were talking about

1175
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:47,660
Speaker 5:  autocorrect and how it's changing in iOS 17 and it reminded me of

1176
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,260
Speaker 5:  one of my favorite weird things that I've been seeing happening on Google

1177
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:54,940
Speaker 5:  lately. I've been playing the legend of Zelda Tears of the kingdom far too

1178
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:58,420
Speaker 5:  much. I'm sure I'm not the only one and he's not. I think half of

1179
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,840
Speaker 5:  this Vergecast does.

1180
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,060
Speaker 4:  How sexy is your link John?

1181
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

1182
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,980
Speaker 3:  That's not where this email's going. Please do not send us emails about

1183
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,660
Speaker 3:  sexy link. I'll take your Samsung emails all

1184
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:14,220
Speaker 3:  day. No sexy link. Send

1185
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:18,200
Speaker 5:  Them all to David. I'd be not very good at video games. I've had to look

1186
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,120
Speaker 5:  up hints and guides regularly and a shorthand folks are generally typing

1187
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,840
Speaker 5:  t o t K for tears of the kingdom plus whatever shrine

1188
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,920
Speaker 5:  quest boss battle that they're looking for.

1189
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,820
Speaker 3:  I can confirm I do this all the time. So

1190
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:33,680
Speaker 5:  IOS doesn't recognize t o T K as a word 'cause it's

1191
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,600
Speaker 5:  not and auto completes it as York. So now on Google, if

1192
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,240
Speaker 5:  you start to type the name of a shrine or a quest, one of the auto completes

1193
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,920
Speaker 5:  will inevitably include York at the end because people are hitting

1194
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,710
Speaker 5:  search too quickly.

1195
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:49,920
Speaker 3:  This is so good. It's true. Yes. By the way you can start typing glia and

1196
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,140
Speaker 3:  it'll complete to York.

1197
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,360
Speaker 4:  That's amazing.

1198
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,220
Speaker 3:  It's incredible. This is like the emer,

1199
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,170
Speaker 3:  the layered emergent behaviors here are out of control.

1200
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:03,940
Speaker 3:  Right? It's wonderful. So first you have to iOS, maybe Android

1201
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:07,920
Speaker 3:  two doesn't recognize this thing. Regardless of how much they're claiming,

1202
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,400
Speaker 3:  there's machine learning and whatever they haven't figured out. The T O T

1203
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,160
Speaker 3:  K is a thing that is happening. So the keyboards are auto completing to

1204
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,920
Speaker 3:  York and then they're sending that information to Google, which is collecting

1205
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,720
Speaker 3:  millions and millions of searches for things like how to beat

1206
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,520
Speaker 3:  the wind temple and and tears the kingdom and saying, okay, it's wind

1207
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,200
Speaker 3:  Temple York, Google does not understand that that is

1208
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,400
Speaker 3:  an iOS auto complete. And so it's just taking that data as

1209
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,360
Speaker 3:  real and turning that into an auto complete suggestion for millions

1210
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:41,280
Speaker 3:  of other people to see, not understand it all and potentially click on

1211
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,660
Speaker 3:  this. Well it is bonkers. We're

1212
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:48,250
Speaker 4:  We're like one small step away from there being websites

1213
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:52,040
Speaker 4:  with headings that say how do you complete

1214
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,590
Speaker 4:  the wind? Temple York. Yeah.

1215
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:57,340
Speaker 3:  Globo. Yeah. This is the Globo situation. There's gonna be AI websites

1216
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:01,140
Speaker 3:  looking at at at Google Trends. I'm gonna tell the polygon people like a

1217
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,900
Speaker 3:  huge amount of polygons traffic right now is here's the kingdom guides and

1218
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,780
Speaker 3:  I'm be like, you guys gotta start sneaking in some York stuff.

1219
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:07,250
Speaker 4:  Absolutely.

1220
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,450
Speaker 5:  It's a lovely place. Really nice Anglican choir.

1221
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:13,820
Speaker 3:  It's perfect. We, by the way, we have gotten a bunch of emails about iOS

1222
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:17,600
Speaker 3:  autocorrect in general. I'll say that now I'm paying attention

1223
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,580
Speaker 3:  to it. It does seem worse. Yesterday I, I was actually speaking Dieter,

1224
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:24,500
Speaker 3:  I was texting with Dieter And. I said send it to me and it just auto completed

1225
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,420
Speaker 3:  it to Messenger. Yeah. So it just said send it to Messenger.

1226
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:32,300
Speaker 3:  Like it was very confusing. Like why? But I can't tell if

1227
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:36,140
Speaker 3:  that's like, I'm noticing it like whatever that bias is called. But we have

1228
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,490
Speaker 3:  gotten lots of emails from people saying it's, it's much worse.

1229
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:42,380
Speaker 5:  Just don't correct it for a few weeks and see how your

1230
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:45,780
Speaker 5:  friends noticed in the group chat. I definitely got called out the other

1231
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,380
Speaker 5:  day. They're like, Alex, you're your autocorrects going through it right

1232
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:51,250
Speaker 5:  now. It didn't. It just is just like nonsense.

1233
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,340
Speaker 3:  Well we'll see. So we're, we're a month away from the next version of iOS.

1234
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,650
Speaker 3:  Maybe it'll get better, maybe it'll get worse. Who knows what'll happen.

1235
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,220
Speaker 3:  Keep sending us emails about that one.

1236
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:01,060
Speaker 4:  Ple. Yeah, Please keep sending us emails about especially all if you have

1237
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,820
Speaker 4:  specific weird autocorrect things that are happening. We're trying to

1238
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:08,720
Speaker 4:  figure out ways to investigate. This is a weird thing to

1239
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,560
Speaker 4:  try and actually pin down an answer on. But

1240
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,160
Speaker 4:  one thing we need is lots and lots of bizarre autocorrect examples. So if

1241
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,390
Speaker 4:  you get a weird one, send us a screenshot and tell us everything.

1242
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:22,640
Speaker 3:  Also, if you are playing games on your Android gaming

1243
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,560
Speaker 3:  phone, send us an email. No one's ever

1244
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,440
Speaker 3:  done it. The Spen people are out here just smoking it up to

1245
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,560
Speaker 3:  Android. Gaming people, as far as I can tell, don't exist. All right. That's

1246
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,040
Speaker 3:  it. We had to take a break. This is really fun. Send us more emails. We're

1247
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,320
Speaker 3:  gonna read more emails in the show. We, David's already doing it on Wednesday

1248
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,070
Speaker 3:  show all the time. Right?

1249
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:41,660
Speaker 4:  It's great. It's the best part of the show every time. I love it.

1250
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,600
Speaker 3:  If all we do for the rest of the show is respond to reader feedback, well

1251
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,840
Speaker 3:  we have it. But that said, or

1252
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,670
Speaker 4:  Call the hotline. Eight six six vi one one. Call the hotline. Yeah,

1253
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:53,520
Speaker 3:  Hotline and email us vi has to vi com. We love it. We'll be back.

1254
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,170
Speaker 3:  We'll do another, it'll be a quick lightning round this time

1255
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,520
Speaker 3:  we're gonna get through it. We'll be right

1256
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:07,500
Speaker 3:  back.

1257
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,570
Speaker 3:  We're back. It's gonna be an actually fast lightning round. We're gonna do

1258
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:14,220
Speaker 3:  it under 45 minutes. It's gonna be amazing.

1259
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,210
Speaker 3:  Cranz, I think Alex has the best one. Go ahead.

1260
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:20,190
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. I am absolutely obsessed with this. My brother is in the food industry,

1261
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:23,850
Speaker 5:  so anytime like food industry and tech converge, I get really, really

1262
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:27,190
Speaker 5:  excited. MrBeast is suing virtual

1263
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:31,070
Speaker 5:  dining concepts because that's the, the company that kind of

1264
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:35,000
Speaker 5:  ar arranges MrBeast Burger, his Uber

1265
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,030
Speaker 5:  Eats takeout delivery hamburger

1266
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:41,790
Speaker 5:  joints and he's suing them because according

1267
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:44,930
Speaker 5:  to the lawsuit, the Burgers are, the food is

1268
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:48,910
Speaker 5:  revolting and likely the worst burger

1269
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,590
Speaker 5:  the person had ever had. Also

1270
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:54,370
Speaker 4:  Not just according to the lawsuit, according to people who ordered those

1271
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,000
Speaker 4:  Burgers.

1272
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And also inedible like, like it's just full of

1273
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,650
Speaker 5:  insults and, and the pictures are absolutely revolting. You'll

1274
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:06,410
Speaker 5:  be totally disgusted. And I just keep thinking about this and

1275
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:10,290
Speaker 5:  wondering why this all happened and we

1276
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:14,210
Speaker 5:  understand why it happened. MrBeast, it was 2020 restaurants

1277
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:18,010
Speaker 5:  were in dire straits. Everybody I know was unemployed. Like my brother

1278
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,150
Speaker 5:  just didn't work for six months. And so they were like, okay, how can we,

1279
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:25,030
Speaker 5:  how can we help restaurants? Well let's open a lot of ghost kitchens where

1280
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:28,870
Speaker 5:  we can ship food out via Seamless via Uber Eats

1281
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:32,440
Speaker 5:  and you can, you can get your food and the restaurants get to stay open and

1282
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,210
Speaker 5:  everybody wins. And so that's what they did. And these Ghost Kitchens

1283
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:39,890
Speaker 5:  just proliferated. They were everywhere. And Virtual Dining Concepts was

1284
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:43,450
Speaker 5:  like, okay cool. We can partner with people and make their brands take off

1285
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:46,410
Speaker 5:  there. Virtual Dining Concepts was started by one of the guys who did Planet

1286
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:50,130
Speaker 5:  Hollywood. So he like knows his way around branding and

1287
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:52,330
Speaker 5:  churning out horrible food to the masses.

1288
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:54,690
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I was gonna say but does he know his way around good food?

1289
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:57,730
Speaker 5:  And so of course when you're thinking I wanna start a really cool business

1290
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:01,280
Speaker 5:  project involving food, I'll go to that guy. And that's what

1291
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,010
Speaker 5:  MrBeast James Donaldson did. He went to this guy, they were

1292
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:08,050
Speaker 5:  quickly everywhere. I know people who were accidentally ordering him 'cause

1293
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:10,770
Speaker 5:  they'd see like MrBeast Burger and they'd see these gorgeous pictures of

1294
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:13,680
Speaker 5:  Burgers and then they'd get just slop to their houses. Wait,

1295
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,400
Speaker 3:  I just wanna call out the Yeah. The Twitter Thread guys, when MrBeast

1296
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,160
Speaker 3:  Burger launched had a field day. Oh yeah, right. Okay. They were like,

1297
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,680
Speaker 3:  here's the future of all marketing. Here's why MrBeast Burger is poised to

1298
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,580
Speaker 3:  take over from McDonald's. One of 945

1299
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:31,520
Speaker 3:  thread. They've been dead silent since this lawsuit

1300
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,160
Speaker 3:  came in. Yeah.

1301
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,920
Speaker 4:  Everybody was obsessed with Ghost Kitchens like it, this was, this was the

1302
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,430
Speaker 4:  new thing. Yeah. Because

1303
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:40,830
Speaker 5:  It's really hard to,

1304
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:44,480
Speaker 5:  like, it's hard for one restaurant to cons to be consistent every

1305
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,090
Speaker 5:  night. It's really, really hard for one restaurant. Right. It is virtually

1306
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:52,080
Speaker 5:  impossible. And Wendy's and McDonald's and all of them, the

1307
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,940
Speaker 5:  food may sometimes be disgusting. You everybody has their own takes,

1308
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,500
Speaker 5:  but it's cons. It's fairly consistent. Even they struggle with consistency.

1309
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,660
Speaker 5:  And MrBeast was like, yeah, I'm gonna come in with the Planet Hollywood guy

1310
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:05,260
Speaker 5:  and we're also gonna be consistent. Burgers

1311
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:08,400
Speaker 3:  His pitch in the beginning in that, in that covid time was really interesting.

1312
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,800
Speaker 3:  Right? Yeah. It was all these mom and pops are struggling. I'm gonna come

1313
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,320
Speaker 3:  in with this marketing muscle. Anyone can sign up, we'll send you the

1314
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:19,200
Speaker 3:  kit. Burgers are easy to make, relatively we'll send you the materials and

1315
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,940
Speaker 3:  the stickers and the packaging and your mom and Pop can be turbocharged

1316
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,840
Speaker 3:  by my marketing muscle. Right.

1317
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,440
Speaker 4:  So anyone can make Beast Burgers was the idea. Yeah. Right.

1318
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:32,200
Speaker 3:  A lot of Jimmy's brand is altruism and there's however much

1319
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,760
Speaker 3:  controversy associated with that brand and it's whatever. But that is like

1320
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,840
Speaker 3:  the core of his thing, right. Is like, I'll help a lot of people and I'll

1321
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,400
Speaker 3:  get rich along the way. Cool. What's fascinating here is

1322
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,180
Speaker 3:  like it should be relatively easy

1323
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:49,960
Speaker 3:  to make Burgers and have them not be raw and somehow it

1324
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,920
Speaker 3:  wasn't. Right. Like if you just open Seamless or GrubHub

1325
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,000
Speaker 3:  or whatever in the average city, you don't pick MrBeast Burger and you just

1326
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,780
Speaker 3:  pick some restaurant and order some cheeseburger.

1327
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:04,160
Speaker 3:  The chances of it being raw are very low. And

1328
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,900
Speaker 3:  somehow the chances of the MrBeast Burger being

1329
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,880
Speaker 3:  raw were very high. And I. That's the whole thing here

1330
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,340
Speaker 3:  that I just do not understand.

1331
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:17,080
Speaker 5:  So what was happening was Ghost Kitchens, because it's not attached to the

1332
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,200
Speaker 5:  restaurant's brand, the restaurant. Oh they don't

1333
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,200
Speaker 3:  Have to care as much. Yeah. They

1334
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,480
Speaker 5:  Don't have to care. And if You don't care, you're, you're like quality goes

1335
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,000
Speaker 5:  out the window and so quality. Yeah.

1336
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,700
Speaker 4:  You get your like idiot nephew to make the Burgers because they're be Burgers.

1337
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,350
Speaker 4:  It doesn't come back on you.

1338
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:34,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You're like, oh, you go over to the Bees burger like kitchen and you

1339
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,320
Speaker 5:  do all of that. We're gonna actually go make money and build our brand and

1340
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,320
Speaker 5:  just use that to subsidize ourselves. And we've seen that happen. Like a

1341
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,640
Speaker 5:  lot of Ghost Kitchens, this was the way it was like there was one in my old

1342
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,480
Speaker 5:  neighborhood and you'd walk in and the food's really good and then you'd

1343
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,000
Speaker 5:  like go try to order from there on like Seamless. And there were six

1344
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,880
Speaker 5:  different restaurants with the exact same address because they were just

1345
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,600
Speaker 5:  churning out this slop to keep like their actual core really

1346
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,360
Speaker 5:  delicious business going. We have a

1347
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,880
Speaker 3:  Great Josh recipe piece about the, the Chuck e Cheese of it all. What was

1348
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,020
Speaker 3:  the name? Hold on.

1349
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:06,280
Speaker 4:  The Chuck E. Cheese of it all should be the title of somebody's memoir. I

1350
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,640
Speaker 4:  don't know who but it should.

1351
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,160
Speaker 3:  So we have a great Josh Trezza story about chicken wings and ghost

1352
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,320
Speaker 3:  kitchens. We'll link to it. And how many Ghost kitchens make chicken wings

1353
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,880
Speaker 3:  and why Chicken wings are proliferate. It's 'cause they're actually easy

1354
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,540
Speaker 3:  to make. Yeah. And they're cheap. Yeah. By the way, the chicken wing story,

1355
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,840
Speaker 3:  we talked about our background policy before. you know how we don't let press

1356
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,000
Speaker 3:  people be on background? They have to use real names. Chicken Wings story

1357
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,470
Speaker 3:  is like what pushed me over the edge

1358
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:34,080
Speaker 3:  because like one of the big food delivery companies would only talk to

1359
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,760
Speaker 3:  Josh like in Secret and they would only discuss the

1360
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,120
Speaker 3:  popularity of chicken wings. And we were

1361
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,870
Speaker 3:  like, why? Why can't we attribute you saying

1362
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:48,760
Speaker 3:  Chicken wings are very popular? That that

1363
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,430
Speaker 3:  was the one that like broke me. They

1364
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:54,420
Speaker 5:  Slapped back. Like they're, they're telling, they're saying no. He,

1365
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,270
Speaker 5:  he wanted like, he's been bullying us. He's trying to renegotiate the deal.

1366
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:01,590
Speaker 5:  He's bullying us, he's being mean to us. And

1367
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:05,480
Speaker 5:  MrBeast Burger brand will continue on as long as they hold

1368
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,000
Speaker 5:  that contract

1369
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,460
Speaker 3:  Will never stop. Yeah. So will never stop using your name. And like Mr.

1370
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:13,360
Speaker 3:  Tosche. Very good. I'll tell you my, my lawyer

1371
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,320
Speaker 3:  brain is this lawsuit inevitably settles if this lawsuit gets to a

1372
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:21,160
Speaker 3:  jury, the American legal system has completely failed. I say

1373
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,960
Speaker 3:  that in the context of the former president of the United States speaking

1374
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,600
Speaker 3:  indicted this week. you know, that'll happen.

1375
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,520
Speaker 3:  Whatever. If MrBeast Burgers gets to a trial, the American legal

1376
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,920
Speaker 3:  system has failed because this, this thing should completely settle. It should

1377
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:38,800
Speaker 3:  never get to a trial. Okay. My lightning round. Chris Welch big scoop

1378
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,760
Speaker 3:  this week. Sonos Move two hitting in September with stereo sound.

1379
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:46,660
Speaker 3:  24 hour battery life and importantly u s BBC very audio

1380
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,840
Speaker 3:  in hell. Yeah. Which is super cool. We're beginning to see that in more and

1381
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,120
Speaker 3:  more places. Also because it's a portable speaker with big battery, U S B

1382
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,390
Speaker 3:  C port can charge a phone. Very cool.

1383
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:59,080
Speaker 4:  Well you can charge your phone from your gigantic Bluetooth speaker.

1384
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah. 'cause it's also a gigantic battery. Oh,

1385
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,920
Speaker 4:  That's awesome. That's the first time ever that a Sonos speaker being

1386
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,620
Speaker 4:  humongous actually feels like a good idea to me. I'm in on this

1387
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,900
Speaker 4:  now.

1388
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:13,480
Speaker 3:  It has two tweeters in it, so it's stereo sound. They've reoptimize the

1389
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,880
Speaker 3:  controls, it's got automatic trueplay, all this stuff. But yeah, it's the

1390
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:19,560
Speaker 3:  battery that I, I think is particularly cool. And of course it can

1391
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,400
Speaker 3:  do Bluetooth audio as well. And the big upgrade here is it can do Bluetooth

1392
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,800
Speaker 3:  and wi simultaneously, which is pretty

1393
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,420
Speaker 4:  Cool. Chris Welch as ever living in the AC events

1394
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:32,020
Speaker 4:  at Sonos. HQ, it's a good scoop.

1395
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,440
Speaker 3:  That's very good. All right, David, take us home. Mine

1396
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,880
Speaker 4:  Is more a recommendation than anything else. I just wanna let everybody

1397
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,530
Speaker 4:  know that ESPN is doing, it's the OCHO

1398
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:45,240
Speaker 4:  thing again, the history of this is that it was a joke they made in a dodgeball

1399
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:49,040
Speaker 4:  movie in like 2004. And then like 12 years later

1400
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,520
Speaker 4:  ESPN decided, oh we'll actually do it and we'll use this as like a one or

1401
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,080
Speaker 4:  two day thing to show all the sports we don't usually show on tv. So it's

1402
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,750
Speaker 4:  everything from like spike ball to like

1403
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:03,640
Speaker 4:  musical chairs and all kinds of like insane sports you'd never see on

1404
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,940
Speaker 4:  tv. It is the single most fun thing you will ever watch on sports television.

1405
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:10,120
Speaker 4:  And one of the things that they're doing is the Excel World

1406
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:13,640
Speaker 4:  Championships. And. I have found myself deep in the world of

1407
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,400
Speaker 4:  competitive Excel over the last few months. Like getting to know some of

1408
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,380
Speaker 4:  the folks who called this is, they're doing a huge season this year. They

1409
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:24,320
Speaker 4:  did this on ESPN last summer and it was like a big viral hit.

1410
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,320
Speaker 4:  People got really excited because you see competitive Excel on TV and you

1411
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,160
Speaker 4:  immediately go, what in the world is going on? So they're having a big season

1412
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:34,040
Speaker 4:  this year. The culmination is gonna be this big thing at the eSports

1413
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,760
Speaker 4:  arena in Las Vegas. It's gonna be a whole huge thing. But as you're listening

1414
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,640
Speaker 4:  to this on Friday morning, it's airing at 7:00 AM So if

1415
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,420
Speaker 4:  you're listening to this very early, you might get a chance to see it live.

1416
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:47,990
Speaker 4:  But otherwise it will be on YouTube. It'll be on ESPN.

1417
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:51,040
Speaker 4:  Competitive Excel is significantly more fun than you think. It's basically

1418
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,000
Speaker 4:  like puzzle solving using Excel. And if you're the kind

1419
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,940
Speaker 4:  of person who likes to solve puzzles, it's extremely fun. And

1420
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:02,380
Speaker 4:  you've just never seen anybody get so excited about Excel ever in your life.

1421
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,020
Speaker 4:  And I. Love it very much. David,

1422
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:07,940
Speaker 5:  In your piece you call it the Sheeter Ball. Is that true?

1423
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,240
Speaker 4:  No. God no. They don't call it that. Do they

1424
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,640
Speaker 3:  Call it that? No.

1425
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,600
Speaker 4:  I came up with with like 30 or 40 different dumb ideas

1426
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,480
Speaker 4:  about what you might call this, but I think Merge Madness is is the one

1427
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:23,280
Speaker 4:  that I have come back to as, as my favorite. That in the VLOOKUP

1428
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,560
Speaker 4:  Cup. Yeah, I was, I was very proud of both of those. These

1429
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,630
Speaker 5:  Are very good. I was really hoping these were all the actual names. Guys,

1430
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:30,790
Speaker 5:  just, just take that from David Free.

1431
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:34,290
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you can have it. That is, that is public domain courtesy of David

1432
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:37,710
Speaker 4:  Beers. Please take that from me. But yeah,

1433
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:41,520
Speaker 4:  it's the, the OCHO I think is running through the weekend if

1434
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,940
Speaker 4:  I'm not mistaken. And there's all kinds of wild stuff going on, but the,

1435
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:48,870
Speaker 4:  the ESPN stuff should be up probably as you're hearing this and

1436
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:50,270
Speaker 4:  it's extremely delightful.

1437
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:53,030
Speaker 5:  Competitive belt sanding. Yeah dude,

1438
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:56,560
Speaker 4:  This is what I'm saying. It's the same as the tools like imagine anything

1439
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,480
Speaker 4:  in the world and odds are there is somebody who does it for a living

1440
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,220
Speaker 4:  and thus has really strong opinions about it. And there are probably people

1441
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:06,860
Speaker 4:  who do it competitively and that kicks ass

1442
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:08,940
Speaker 5:  Mullet championships.

1443
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:12,880
Speaker 3:  Oh my God. This is what's gonna save ESPN. By the way, I should just do this

1444
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,800
Speaker 3:  the whole time. Mullet

1445
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,400
Speaker 4:  Championships. I'll take Mullet

1446
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,000
Speaker 3:  Championships. The

1447
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,980
Speaker 4:  Pillow Fight Championship is on this weekend. Like come on,

1448
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,580
Speaker 5:  I'm there for it. Tetris.

1449
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:23,880
Speaker 3:  That's very good. I can't believe we haven't been running the fake ESPN music

1450
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,840
Speaker 3:  the whole time. We should have started and stopped the show. Andrew, can

1451
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,280
Speaker 3:  we get a few more minutes of guitar Solo please? Hard? No from

1452
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:34,000
Speaker 3:  Andrew. Alright, that's it. We've gone way

1453
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,950
Speaker 3:  over as always. Bunch of cool stuff on the site. Speaking of Andrew,

1454
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:41,880
Speaker 3:  he's got a great piece on the original Zenith clicker remote, which is

1455
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:45,800
Speaker 3:  ultrasonic. When you push the button, it hit an aluminum rod and that's how

1456
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,660
