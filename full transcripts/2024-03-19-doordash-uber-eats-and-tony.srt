00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:06,205
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of scale DV

3
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:09,925
Speaker 1:  production. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am in the park walking my

4
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:13,765
Speaker 1:  dog, but also doing some headphone testing. So I discovered a month or

5
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:16,845
Speaker 1:  so ago that I was wearing headphones too often and it was actually making

6
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:20,445
Speaker 1:  my ears itch, and I had switched from like the

7
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:24,485
Speaker 1:  AirPods Pro Sony Link Budd style that actually shove into your ear

8
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:28,325
Speaker 1:  to just a normal pair of AirPods that just kind of hangs there. But even

9
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:32,005
Speaker 1:  that wasn't solving my whole problem. So now I'm on this weird quest for

10
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:35,845
Speaker 1:  what I guess I would call non headphone headphones. I'm trying to find

11
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:39,645
Speaker 1:  something that doesn't go in my ear but will still play music and

12
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:43,125
Speaker 1:  won't annoy everyone around me. So I've been testing smart glasses, like

13
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,805
Speaker 1:  the stuff you get from Meta or Amazon, I've been testing things like these.

14
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:50,765
Speaker 1:  The Shocks, headphones, their bone conduction headphones. They just like

15
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:54,165
Speaker 1:  send sound through your cheekbone instead of your ear. It's all sort of fascinating.

16
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:57,805
Speaker 1:  I'm not sure any of it is as good as what I left behind, but at least my

17
00:00:57,805 --> 00:01:01,565
Speaker 1:  ears don't itch anymore. So we're making progress. Anyway, we have an awesome

18
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:05,445
Speaker 1:  show coming up for you today. We are gonna do two things. First, we're gonna

19
00:01:05,445 --> 00:01:08,925
Speaker 1:  tell a delivery story. Will Poor went out on the streets of Seattle

20
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:13,045
Speaker 1:  and met a guy who is taking on Uber, Eats and DoorDash and this whole

21
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:16,445
Speaker 1:  crazy delivery industry all by himself. Super fun.

22
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,565
Speaker 1:  You're gonna like it. Then we're gonna talk about Rivian, which just launched

23
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:24,445
Speaker 1:  two new cars that people are very excited about. But in the process of that,

24
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:28,405
Speaker 1:  I discovered I don't really understand anything about this company or

25
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:32,565
Speaker 1:  why we think it might win because there's really no evidence to

26
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:35,725
Speaker 1:  suggest that it's going to. So we're gonna get into that. We're gonna answer

27
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:39,285
Speaker 1:  a question from the Hotline, all kinds of fun stuff. But first I just got

28
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:42,405
Speaker 1:  the notification that these batteries are about to die, which means it's

29
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:44,925
Speaker 1:  the end of the dog walk. This is The Vergecast. We'll see you in a sec.

30
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:06,055
Speaker 1:  Welcome back. All right, I made it home. Everything's charging. I have to

31
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:09,655
Speaker 1:  say I like the bone conduction headphones so far, although the shocks ones

32
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,735
Speaker 1:  that I was wearing were pretty expensive, and I also bought another pair

33
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:16,495
Speaker 1:  from a brand I can't pronounce that is just like a bunch of consonants in

34
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:20,215
Speaker 1:  a row on Amazon for like a sixth of the price. And they look basically

35
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:23,255
Speaker 1:  identical. So we'll have to see If. you really get what you pay for there.

36
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:27,175
Speaker 1:  Anyway, let's get into the show. For years now, I've been

37
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:31,375
Speaker 1:  conflicted about these delivery apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats. They are

38
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,455
Speaker 1:  super convenient and they're helpful and Sometimes, I don't want to cook

39
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:38,135
Speaker 1:  or go out, and most of us don't live within walking distance of a million

40
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,095
Speaker 1:  good restaurants. Like I get it. I get why they're helpful and good, but

41
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:45,815
Speaker 1:  I also can't shake this idea that actually these services are bad

42
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:49,535
Speaker 1:  and they're bad for everyone involved. They make your meals more expensive,

43
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:53,375
Speaker 1:  often more than you know through sneaky price increases. Like

44
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:57,495
Speaker 1:  the menu on Uber. Eats is sometimes just more expensive than the

45
00:03:57,495 --> 00:04:01,175
Speaker 1:  menu at the restaurant. They also don't pay delivery people enough

46
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,695
Speaker 1:  or offer them the protections or benefits that the people who work there

47
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:07,775
Speaker 1:  should get. And for the most part, historically speaking, they're not even

48
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:11,415
Speaker 1:  a very good business for the companies running them. It's hard to make money

49
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:15,455
Speaker 1:  for anybody, including the restaurants, the drivers, everybody.

50
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,615
Speaker 1:  It just seems bad. So what are we doing here? Anyway, a couple of

51
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:23,415
Speaker 1:  weeks ago, there was this guy who went viral online because of some posters

52
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:27,255
Speaker 1:  he had put up around Seattle saying basically, skip the apps, call me

53
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:30,775
Speaker 1:  instead, I'll deliver your food. He became kind of a folk hero

54
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:35,055
Speaker 1:  online. So we sent our producer will pour to go see what's going on.

55
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:40,155
Speaker 3:  This is one of those stories that exists because of a perfect storm type

56
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:44,315
Speaker 3:  situation. Here's what happened for years gig workers

57
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:48,355
Speaker 3:  here in Seattle. Notably, delivery drivers have been pissed at the lousy

58
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,755
Speaker 3:  pay they've been earning in this very expensive city. So in

59
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:55,875
Speaker 3:  2022, the city council stepped in and mandated a higher pay rate

60
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,235
Speaker 3:  for app-based delivery workers.

61
00:04:57,745 --> 00:05:01,595
Speaker 4:  It's a good day for gig workers. As the city of Seattle's new ordinance takes

62
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:02,035
Speaker 4:  effect.

63
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,915
Speaker 3:  The new PayScale went into effect this past January and the apps

64
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:07,955
Speaker 3:  didn't take the change graciously

65
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:12,275
Speaker 5:  In reaction. Apps like Uber, Eats and DoorDash began charging

66
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:15,875
Speaker 5:  customers $5 in what they're calling a local operating fee.

67
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,715
Speaker 3:  That's on top of the service fees and delivery fees that apps

68
00:05:19,715 --> 00:05:23,675
Speaker 3:  routinely charged to say nothing of. Tips and customers are

69
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:27,355
Speaker 3:  finding their limits. Fewer people are ordering from the apps, gig workers

70
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,395
Speaker 3:  are feeling even more squeezed and everyone is pointing fingers at everyone

71
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:31,515
Speaker 3:  else.

72
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:36,035
Speaker 6:  Food delivery orders plummeting. Since Seattle implemented new minimum

73
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:38,875
Speaker 6:  wage requirements for delivery workers a month ago.

74
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:42,715
Speaker 3:  Good. This kind of battle is playing out in other markets too. New York City

75
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:46,515
Speaker 3:  enacted similar rules last year, which the apps have also been fighting tooth

76
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:50,315
Speaker 3:  and nail. But there's one thing Seattle has that no one else does.

77
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:55,235
Speaker 3:  A guy named Tony Isles who I am trying to literally chase down

78
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:55,715
Speaker 3:  right now,

79
00:05:56,635 --> 00:06:00,285
Speaker 7:  I always carry like a tennis ball in my pocket for like the round fluidity

80
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:03,885
Speaker 7:  of a ball. I just like the idea of like when I was in San Francisco, I had

81
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:07,405
Speaker 7:  a conversation with my buddy and I was like, do you think shapes have thoughts?

82
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:10,085
Speaker 7:  And I think I do. I think they do. I think that they influence the way that

83
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:13,045
Speaker 7:  you think. Yeah, and I, I always carry that tennis ball. So. I always feel

84
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:14,485
Speaker 7:  like I have like a fluid mind.

85
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:19,285
Speaker 3:  Tony is telling me this, while flying across downtown Seattle on a

86
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:23,165
Speaker 3:  rented e-bike in the pouring rain, I'm on my own rental trying

87
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:26,925
Speaker 3:  to listen and keep up at the same time. We're weaving in and out of bike

88
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:30,645
Speaker 3:  lanes, dodging construction and crashing through puddles that could be

89
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:31,285
Speaker 3:  potholes.

90
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:36,965
Speaker 3:  It's chaos, which is partly the setting and partly

91
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:41,085
Speaker 3:  Tony's fluid mind. In the first 30 minutes or so of pedaling, we

92
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:45,005
Speaker 3:  have talked about Maslow's hierarchy of needs, China's social credit score

93
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:48,685
Speaker 3:  and the Stanford Prison experiment. And I haven't asked any of the questions

94
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:49,445
Speaker 3:  I came to ask.

95
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:52,165
Speaker 7:  There's this idea called the method of Loki. I don't know if you know what

96
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:55,925
Speaker 7:  that is. I don't. It's like this way of remembering things

97
00:06:56,325 --> 00:07:00,165
Speaker 7:  verbatim historically in like these ancient societies. It was also this,

98
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:03,725
Speaker 7:  this book that I read, it was called Moonwalking with Einstein. Take a left.

99
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:04,805
Speaker 7:  Hey,

100
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:08,525
Speaker 3:  If we get separated for any reason, just go finish your delivery

101
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:11,245
Speaker 3:  and text me when you're done. I'll, I'll find you again. All right.

102
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,005
Speaker 7:  Okay. Oh, 'cause I'm hustling.

103
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:17,605
Speaker 3:  Well, I just realized that I signed up to do a story about a delivery guy.

104
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:19,125
Speaker 7:  You're all right man. And

105
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,565
Speaker 3:  I don't know how I expected this to go, but

106
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:22,165
Speaker 7:  It's a pleasure meeting you. I

107
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:25,885
Speaker 3:  Got, I gotta up my game here. Tony's

108
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:29,845
Speaker 3:  backstory is pretty simple. He was driving for Uber Eats when

109
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:33,765
Speaker 3:  those new fees suddenly killed demand. So at the beginning of February,

110
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:37,925
Speaker 3:  he decided to go it alone. He put up some very DIY flyers

111
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:41,845
Speaker 3:  downtown with an offer, text him a food order from any restaurant

112
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:45,165
Speaker 3:  within a couple square miles and he'll get it to you for five bucks.

113
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:49,565
Speaker 3:  No taking a cut from restaurants, no service fee, no delivery

114
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:53,525
Speaker 3:  fee, no local operating fee, just a tip if you're feeling

115
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:56,165
Speaker 3:  generous. He went viral pretty much instantly.

116
00:07:56,695 --> 00:08:00,365
Speaker 8:  Right now on Kro seven tonight, growing frustrations for Seattle's new food

117
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:01,125
Speaker 8:  delivery rules,

118
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:03,445
Speaker 6:  One driver becomes his boss's competitor.

119
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:03,965
Speaker 7:  I

120
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:07,605
Speaker 3:  Think I now, just a few weeks later, Tony is a full on local

121
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:11,245
Speaker 3:  celebrity. He's all over the news, Reddit, Twitter slash

122
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:15,325
Speaker 3:  x, and he says the orders have followed. The biggest challenge is Cadence.

123
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,485
Speaker 3:  He might get five texts all at once and then nothing for a while. So

124
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:23,445
Speaker 3:  he's trying to figure that out along with the fame. Has this amount of attention

125
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:24,885
Speaker 3:  been weird? Oh,

126
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:29,085
Speaker 7:  It's crazy. I mean, it's just like all of a sudden my opinion matters.

127
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:33,045
Speaker 7:  And a lot of people are asking me, they're just like, how much money are

128
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,005
Speaker 7:  you making? And I'm like, right,

129
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:34,285
Speaker 3:  Right.

130
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:38,605
Speaker 7:  I'm like, well, I'm not a monetary guy, I'm not a business orientated

131
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:42,525
Speaker 7:  person. But what's interesting is, is like I feel like I've introduced

132
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,405
Speaker 7:  a solution for like a social thing.

133
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:49,965
Speaker 3:  Tony's social solution goes something like this because of apps

134
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:53,685
Speaker 3:  like Uber, Eats and DoorDash. Yes, delivery has gotten expensive,

135
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:58,045
Speaker 3:  but more than that it's gotten rushed and sloppy and impersonal.

136
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:02,445
Speaker 3:  It's just bad vibes all the way down and it's ruining takeout for everyone.

137
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,045
Speaker 7:  It's such a hard position to be in.

138
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:05,845
Speaker 3:  For who?

139
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:09,085
Speaker 7:  For, for everybody. Every party that's involved. The restaurants. Yeah, the

140
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:13,005
Speaker 7:  city, the people that are working as a deliverer, they're

141
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:16,885
Speaker 7:  in this terrible toxic relationship with somebody like the

142
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:20,685
Speaker 3:  Restaurant owners and the apps and the apps and the drivers and just

143
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:20,805
Speaker 7:  Like

144
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:22,085
Speaker 3:  That whole, that whole thing.

145
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,485
Speaker 7:  Well just like think about it, last time you went into a restaurant and some

146
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:27,445
Speaker 7:  driver goes in and is like cuts in front of you and you're just like, what

147
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:30,445
Speaker 7:  in the world? Like, hey man, I've been standing here for five minutes. What,

148
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,285
Speaker 7:  what? What's your problem? you know that that person is, they're like, they're

149
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:37,205
Speaker 7:  hustling, right? So they're going in. Yeah. And they're not thinking about

150
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:38,805
Speaker 7:  that at all because that's not their psychology.

151
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:42,605
Speaker 3:  No, they gotta keep moving, right? And from where Tony's standing,

152
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:45,605
Speaker 3:  the Apps are moving in precisely the wrong direction.

153
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:50,165
Speaker 7:  I think that they, the apps have this kind of misaligned misdirection

154
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:53,525
Speaker 7:  of where they think the market is and what, what they're planning for. I

155
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:57,245
Speaker 7:  think that their whole goal is to like send robots to the buildings and

156
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:01,645
Speaker 7:  you know, send automated cars and it's like, okay, well if

157
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:04,485
Speaker 7:  that's your solution then you might bleed for a while, right? Like, and so

158
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:07,965
Speaker 7:  it's like, yeah, I'm not a monetary guy, but I, I could tell you how to make

159
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:09,045
Speaker 7:  it work a little bit better.

160
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:13,565
Speaker 3:  Tony's whole thing is to strip all the tech and anonymity outta the process

161
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:17,965
Speaker 3:  and be your friendly neighborhood delivery guy. And he thinks people will

162
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:22,285
Speaker 3:  actively prefer a more social alternative, even if that care and attention

163
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:23,005
Speaker 3:  limits him.

164
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:26,485
Speaker 7:  I'm almost like kind of certain, once I get to a certain number of people

165
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:30,245
Speaker 7:  that order from me, I almost kind of want to cap it to kind of

166
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:32,325
Speaker 7:  ensure the law of of Dunbar

167
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,685
Speaker 3:  Dunbar's number is another favorite Tony topic. It's a theoretical limit

168
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:40,325
Speaker 3:  to the number of social relationships any one person can maintain.

169
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:44,045
Speaker 3:  You wanna cap the number of people that order from you so that you can

170
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:48,285
Speaker 3:  stop and chat for a couple of minutes so you can get to know repeat

171
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:49,445
Speaker 3:  customers Wouldn't

172
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:52,125
Speaker 7:  Even call 'em customers. I would just, I would just call them my friends,

173
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,405
Speaker 7:  the homies, you know? There you go. Yeah, they're, they're literally like,

174
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,485
Speaker 7:  yo Tony, can you get this for me? And I think that's kind of the thing is,

175
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:01,325
Speaker 7:  is like when you try to turn it into a business to customer relationship

176
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:04,685
Speaker 7:  versus a person to person relationship, they're not gonna be his understanding.

177
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:07,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah, if I, if I forget your drink right now, someone will be like, Tony,

178
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:11,405
Speaker 7:  it's fine. Yeah, you don't have to go back to Chipotle. Totally. But if I

179
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,925
Speaker 7:  forget on Uber Eats, they're gonna be like, yo man, what's going on here?

180
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:19,645
Speaker 3:  In short, Tony thinks that there is a whole lot more to delivery than speed

181
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,525
Speaker 3:  and cost. But yes, he is cheaper than the competition

182
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,445
Speaker 3:  and often faster too.

183
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:29,325
Speaker 7:  I've never seen anybody run through a target. I picked up somebody's target

184
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:30,725
Speaker 7:  stuff and I was running through the target.

185
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:34,765
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna run here real quick. Yeah.

186
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:40,205
Speaker 3:  I follow Tony as he makes two, maybe three deliveries back to back

187
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:43,685
Speaker 3:  some chicken and a shake from Dave's hot chicken. Hey,

188
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:45,045
Speaker 7:  Is it, does it come with a drink or anything?

189
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:49,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah, lemme get a salad from a Healthy Bowl place called Evergreens.

190
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:53,805
Speaker 3:  I'm honestly not a hundred percent sure it was such a blur. But at each

191
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:57,605
Speaker 3:  pickup and drop off, Tony lives up to his own pitch. He's

192
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:00,965
Speaker 3:  courteous, warm, casual, and chatty. So

193
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:01,765
Speaker 7:  Man, how you doing? Today

194
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:05,925
Speaker 3:  We pull up to our next destination, a big apartment building, and while we

195
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,205
Speaker 3:  wait in the lobby for Tony's customer, sorry, his homey to come down,

196
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:11,525
Speaker 3:  he's recognized by a stranger.

197
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:15,565
Speaker 7:  You're the guy. Thank. Yeah, I am. Nice. So nice to meet you. Nice to meet.

198
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:19,365
Speaker 3:  I stop and chat with Tony's homie for a few minutes. How far away? He says

199
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:22,765
Speaker 3:  that he and his roommates have ordered from Tony maybe 10 times in the past

200
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:23,085
Speaker 3:  month.

201
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:26,845
Speaker 9:  I was just scrolling through Reddit one day and then I saw someone posting

202
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:31,125
Speaker 9:  a, they posted a picture of one of his flyers that were posted

203
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:33,725
Speaker 9:  like in the city and I was like, oh, that's pretty interesting. It's cheaper

204
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:36,485
Speaker 9:  than DoorDash. So I was like, let me give it a try. And then ever since it's

205
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:39,365
Speaker 9:  like been me and my roommates I go to, oh,

206
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:41,685
Speaker 3:  Nice. So you guys are like serious regulars at this point.

207
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:43,285
Speaker 9:  Like I was saying like between the three of us type

208
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:46,645
Speaker 3:  Thing. And were you Uber Eats DoorDash people before that?

209
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,445
Speaker 9:  Yeah, exactly. DoorDash mainly. And then it was just like got expensive,

210
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:51,685
Speaker 9:  so we're like, let's see what else? There's,

211
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:55,685
Speaker 3:  What's the like the Tony experience like and how is it different from

212
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:56,645
Speaker 3:  the, the apps?

213
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,085
Speaker 9:  I think it's a lot nicer because first of all, all you have to do is just

214
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:02,645
Speaker 9:  like text him. So that's already a lot easier. He's much faster

215
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:05,565
Speaker 9:  and it's always nice like having like a quick conversation with him. And

216
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:09,045
Speaker 9:  like the lobby, he always waits. He's fun to talk to. He is a, he is a very

217
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:11,445
Speaker 9:  chill guy. Like we've had some nice conversations. It's cool.

218
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:18,205
Speaker 3:  At the end of the lunch Rush Tony and I sat down at a cafe to talk some more.

219
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:22,525
Speaker 3:  I went into the story wanting to know whether a guy like Tony can make it.

220
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:26,765
Speaker 3:  Seattle's minimum wage is almost $20 an hour. So to match

221
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:30,045
Speaker 3:  that, he'd need four deliveries an hour, not accounting for tips,

222
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:34,325
Speaker 3:  which after seeing him in action definitely feels doable. but it

223
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:38,085
Speaker 3:  is a hustle. In other words, it's still gig work and

224
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:42,045
Speaker 3:  Tony's only working the lunch and dinner rushes right now. So after this

225
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:45,485
Speaker 3:  whole adventure, my question remains, can he make it?

226
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:48,485
Speaker 3:  It turns out that is Tony's least favorite question.

227
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:52,725
Speaker 7:  I'm looking at it as like, I just understand people, you know people, they

228
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:56,685
Speaker 7:  all have their perspectives and all I'm trying to be is the glue that glues

229
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:59,765
Speaker 7:  you in that connective tissue so that that way you can get off Reddit and

230
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:03,685
Speaker 7:  stop arguing about how much money I'm making, get off Reddit

231
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:06,685
Speaker 7:  and stop arguing whether it's gonna be financially responsible. I can figure

232
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:07,485
Speaker 7:  that out on my own.

233
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:11,605
Speaker 3:  I get the sense that Tony has become a kind of avatar.

234
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:15,565
Speaker 3:  Everyone's putting all their thoughts and feelings about the gig economy

235
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:19,685
Speaker 3:  onto him. I think that's why his story blew up online. If, you're

236
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:23,325
Speaker 3:  frustrated by big, powerful companies making life more annoying.

237
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:28,005
Speaker 3:  He's the folk hero to root for, which is just way too much

238
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,205
Speaker 3:  for Tony to take on.

239
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,045
Speaker 7:  All of a sudden, like people are texting me and they're like, you got a great

240
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,725
Speaker 7:  business mind. And I'm like, what are you talking about? And I think that

241
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:40,365
Speaker 7:  what people are trying to do, they're trying to box me. They're trying to

242
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:44,005
Speaker 7:  say, Tony fits here. And I think what they're, they're lacking of

243
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:47,125
Speaker 7:  understanding is, is like, I actually don't fit anywhere.

244
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:51,645
Speaker 7:  I'm this like round ball that's just rolling down the street. Like

245
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:52,085
Speaker 3:  The one in your

246
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:53,405
Speaker 7:  Pocket. That's exactly, exactly.

247
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:59,565
Speaker 3:  Tony has no idea whether tonydelivers will make it or

248
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,285
Speaker 3:  what will happen to food delivery more broadly. He just knows that something

249
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:03,965
Speaker 3:  needs to change.

250
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:07,725
Speaker 7:  Like what they tried to do is they tried to put food on a conveyor belt

251
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:12,325
Speaker 7:  and deliver it like an Amazon package. And it's not gonna work. They're winning

252
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:16,245
Speaker 7:  right now, but at the end of the day, it is not gonna work. It's too expensive.

253
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:19,885
Speaker 7:  They're like waiting for things to be solved and they're hoping,

254
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:24,045
Speaker 7:  they're hoping that somebody down the line is like intelligence is gonna

255
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:26,285
Speaker 7:  hit that s-curve. They're gonna be able to plug in the robots and they're

256
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:29,445
Speaker 7:  gonna, they're gonna be able to do it. And I'm here to tell you it's not

257
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:29,805
Speaker 7:  gonna work

258
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:35,005
Speaker 3:  As kg as Tony is about his own future. He will say that he's been

259
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:38,645
Speaker 3:  fielding calls from all over the country, people who have heard his story

260
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,005
Speaker 3:  and wanna do what he does.

261
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:44,445
Speaker 7:  So it's like, all right, well how can I then be the Energizer bunny for

262
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:48,205
Speaker 7:  some things that we do like and that we do think about and maybe that I can

263
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:52,485
Speaker 7:  kind of more positively impact in a different sense. Just

264
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:56,445
Speaker 7:  giving people the right direction, energizing their buddy, you know, so

265
00:15:56,445 --> 00:16:00,005
Speaker 7:  to speak. Giving them the battery to to to kind of the right mindset.

266
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:04,925
Speaker 3:  So what does this all reveal about the gig economy? Well, Tony

267
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:08,965
Speaker 3:  has clearly tapped into something and in spite of his grander

268
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:12,485
Speaker 3:  pronouncements, what he's saying is pretty straightforward.

269
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:16,645
Speaker 7:  I think that what it represents, I think personally is like

270
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:20,765
Speaker 7:  this idea that we don't need the Apps.

271
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,925
Speaker 3:  We're so used to Apps mediating all of our activities that

272
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,405
Speaker 3:  at this point, what if not Apps actually feels

273
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,205
Speaker 3:  revelatory, but it's telling that Tony's customers are

274
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:36,885
Speaker 3:  more than happy to ditch Uber, Eats and DoorDash at the drop of a hat

275
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:41,365
Speaker 3:  or the drop of a new fee. And if big tech companies really do

276
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:44,925
Speaker 3:  double down on automation and robots, more people

277
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,285
Speaker 3:  might actively seek out more humanity, more

278
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:52,125
Speaker 3:  idiosyncrasy, more Tony. Tony

279
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:56,165
Speaker 3:  himself wants to experiment and meet people and hopefully

280
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:59,725
Speaker 3:  pay the bills. And if he accidentally starts a revolution along the way,

281
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:01,245
Speaker 3:  all the better.

282
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:05,805
Speaker 7:  It would be nice to be known as the guy that was trying to connect us back

283
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:09,045
Speaker 7:  together. That'd be kind of cool, but not in like the sense of like, this

284
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:12,685
Speaker 7:  was the guy, it was just more like, oh, like this. Tony Isles mentioned this

285
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:16,005
Speaker 7:  and we thought it was like a good idea and it worked. And then like eventually,

286
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:17,365
Speaker 7:  like we reconnected.

287
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:43,175
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. So a couple of weeks ago the EV maker Rivian

288
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:44,255
Speaker 1:  launched some new cars.

289
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:48,405
Speaker 13:  I'm so excited to have all of you here. Let me introduce you to R two.

290
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:52,725
Speaker 1:  The cars look great actually and people got particularly excited about the

291
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:53,525
Speaker 1:  R three talk

292
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:57,445
Speaker 13:  About R two's sibling, which we call R three,

293
00:20:57,615 --> 00:21:00,965
Speaker 1:  Which is a little crossover style EV coming someday,

294
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:06,045
Speaker 1:  but I couldn't stop thinking during this event like who even

295
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:10,205
Speaker 1:  is Rivian. Over the last few years, this company has been set up as one

296
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:13,805
Speaker 1:  of the most exciting companies in the car industry and a real

297
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:17,885
Speaker 1:  genuine Tesla rival. But from everything I hear and read,

298
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:21,525
Speaker 1:  it is very much still a startup. It doesn't make that many cars, it's bleeding

299
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:25,245
Speaker 1:  money and it's not lighting up the sales charts. So

300
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:29,285
Speaker 1:  what gives here is Rivian really the golden child. We

301
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:33,005
Speaker 1:  sometimes make it out to be. I asked the verges Andy Hawkins to come on and

302
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:36,925
Speaker 1:  help us understand where Rivian came from, why it's so well liked, and

303
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:40,525
Speaker 1:  whether it really has a shot to win like Tesla level win.

304
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:42,765
Speaker 1:  Andy Hawkins Welcome back to The Vergecast.

305
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:43,845
Speaker 14:  Hey, how's it going?

306
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:47,925
Speaker 1:  I'm confused. Ah, where did this company come from and how did it become

307
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:51,165
Speaker 1:  kind of the one that we talked to next to Tesla? Yeah,

308
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:55,005
Speaker 14:  So I. Think the most interesting thing about Rivian was that it was a secret

309
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:58,685
Speaker 14:  for a very long time. The company was actually, I think founded in like

310
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:02,485
Speaker 14:  2008, but it didn't come out of stealth,

311
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,605
Speaker 14:  as they say, until around

312
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:07,205
Speaker 14:  20 17, 20 18.

313
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:08,565
Speaker 1:  That's a long time.

314
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:12,525
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Which is I think a, a much longer time to be sort of secretive than

315
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:16,365
Speaker 14:  I think your average company that's in the stealth mode. So that was kind

316
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:19,445
Speaker 14:  of interesting right out of the gate. And then secondly, they had a very

317
00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:22,365
Speaker 14:  compelling proposition right away, which was that, you know, we're gonna

318
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:25,765
Speaker 14:  make Electric vehicles only electric vehicles. They're going to be

319
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:29,765
Speaker 14:  adventure themed, they're gonna be for off-roading, for camping, for

320
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:33,165
Speaker 14:  exploring nature, and it's gonna have a very

321
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:36,805
Speaker 14:  distinctive design language. And so If, you look at sort of the first couple

322
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:40,685
Speaker 14:  products that the company introduced several years ago, the

323
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:44,685
Speaker 14:  R one T truck and the R one SSUV, they're both very

324
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:48,405
Speaker 14:  similar looking to each other and they have this kind of design that is

325
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:52,245
Speaker 14:  very friendly. It has kind of a cute face with big oval headlights

326
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:56,125
Speaker 14:  that kind of look like eyes with a light bar that kind of runs across

327
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:59,805
Speaker 14:  the middle of the, of the grill. It just has like kind of a very friendly,

328
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:04,085
Speaker 14:  approachable design to them. And then also I think the products themselves

329
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:07,885
Speaker 14:  were very clearly meant to slot into those

330
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:11,445
Speaker 14:  segments in the auto industry today that are the most popular pickup trucks

331
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:15,645
Speaker 14:  and large three row SUVs So I think a lot of people

332
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:19,805
Speaker 14:  saw this company as you know, a very serious contender that they weren't

333
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:23,245
Speaker 14:  some sort of vanity play. They were gonna try to actually

334
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:27,045
Speaker 14:  compete with some of the legacy automakers as well as Tesla. And I think

335
00:23:27,045 --> 00:23:30,845
Speaker 14:  a lot of people were very compelled by the, by the image, by the optimism

336
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:33,565
Speaker 14:  and the friendliness that the company was trying to put out there. It's,

337
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:36,725
Speaker 14:  and So I think that those are the couple reasons why a lot of people are

338
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:39,205
Speaker 14:  very interested in Rivian and, and you hear a lot of people talking about

339
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:39,605
Speaker 14:  them today.

340
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:43,645
Speaker 1:  Okay, so part of why I've always thought this company was odd is that

341
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:47,725
Speaker 1:  some of what you just described is kind of the playbook in this space,

342
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:51,365
Speaker 1:  right? This is what a, a bunch of these companies have tried to do is go

343
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:55,365
Speaker 1:  for the kind of most obvious segments of this thing, but also

344
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:58,365
Speaker 1:  to kind of like sell you this beautiful vision of a better electric future

345
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:01,445
Speaker 1:  of cars, which I think all of these companies have sort of spent a decade

346
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:05,045
Speaker 1:  doing is like making grand promises about how everything's gonna be

347
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:07,885
Speaker 1:  electrified. So you might as well go along for the ride, but I feel like

348
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:11,525
Speaker 1:  from the jump when Rivian came out, we put

349
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:15,645
Speaker 1:  Rivian up in the kind of stratosphere of like one of the serious

350
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:18,205
Speaker 1:  players in a way that I feel like we don't talk about Polestar that way.

351
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:21,925
Speaker 1:  We don't talk about lucid that way. We don't talk about kind of this other

352
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:25,045
Speaker 1:  handful of, of companies that are actually, you know, out there producing

353
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:29,125
Speaker 1:  cars in some volume. But Rivian from the beginning was like held up

354
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:32,925
Speaker 1:  next to Tesla as kind of one of the great promises of the

355
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,005
Speaker 1:  electric car. Why?

356
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:39,165
Speaker 14:  You know, I don't know if that's true. Exactly. Okay. If I could just push

357
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:42,805
Speaker 14:  back a little bit please. I do think that they were, they

358
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:46,605
Speaker 14:  generated a lot of excitement and a lot of people were very interested

359
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:50,485
Speaker 14:  in them and I think that the company's founder and CEO

360
00:24:50,785 --> 00:24:54,725
Speaker 14:  RJ Scri presents sort of like a very interesting figurine contrast

361
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:58,605
Speaker 14:  to Elon Musk. He was a lot more polished, not so prone

362
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:02,725
Speaker 14:  to any racist rants on social media platforms or, or

363
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:05,845
Speaker 14:  what have you. Sure. And just seemed like, you know, sort of like a very

364
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:09,765
Speaker 14:  trustworthy, serious business guy who had like a definite vision

365
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:13,565
Speaker 14:  for the company. Which is not to say that the company I think was immediately

366
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:17,925
Speaker 14:  elevated to the same status as Tesla because I

367
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:21,005
Speaker 14:  think the, the fact remains, you know, they, they're a low volume company.

368
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:24,445
Speaker 14:  They only sell several tens of thousands of vehicles every year

369
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:28,765
Speaker 14:  as compared to Tesla, which sells over a million cars every year. Or even

370
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:31,605
Speaker 14:  the legacy automakers which sell millions upon millions of cars, right?

371
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:35,085
Speaker 14:  And so, you know, it's, I think there was a lot of excitement and I think

372
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:38,925
Speaker 14:  through that haze of, of excitement, I think that there, people could

373
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:42,405
Speaker 14:  make the assumption that this was like a company that was on par

374
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:46,525
Speaker 14:  at the same level as the rest of the, the industry or, or even

375
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:50,085
Speaker 14:  some of the upstarts like Tesla. But I, I think that the reality of the

376
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:53,445
Speaker 14:  situation was they only make a few vehicles every year. They only had two

377
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:57,165
Speaker 14:  models that were available to consumers plus an electric delivery van,

378
00:25:57,165 --> 00:26:00,485
Speaker 14:  which was only available to Amazon exclusively for a while, but is now Oh

379
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:03,325
Speaker 14:  right. Supposedly gonna be sold to some other companies as well.

380
00:26:03,635 --> 00:26:07,165
Speaker 1:  That was a big deal, right? Amazon made a lot of noise about buying a lot

381
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,245
Speaker 1:  of trucks from Rivian. That was gonna be a big thing. It was

382
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:12,885
Speaker 14:  A huge deal and I think that that was one of the things Amazon's

383
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:16,725
Speaker 14:  backing their investment in the company, their commitment to buying a hundred

384
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:20,565
Speaker 14:  thousand electric delivery vans from Rivian plus an investment from Ford

385
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:24,165
Speaker 14:  as well, gave a lot of people the impression that this was going to be the

386
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,085
Speaker 14:  next big electric car company. When in reality they were going to confront

387
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:31,965
Speaker 14:  a lot of the same challenges as Tesla and even

388
00:26:32,145 --> 00:26:35,605
Speaker 14:  as the legacy automakers are really confronting at the moment too. And if

389
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:39,725
Speaker 14:  anything, it was going to be a lot tougher for Rivian because as a new player,

390
00:26:39,985 --> 00:26:43,765
Speaker 14:  as a, what they call pure play EV, a company that only makes

391
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:48,045
Speaker 14:  EV electric vehicles and not any hybrids or internal combustion

392
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:51,685
Speaker 14:  vehicles. So they have no other revenue to fall back on if the market

393
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:54,605
Speaker 14:  dips, which it is now, and I assume we're gonna talk about they're gonna

394
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:57,765
Speaker 14:  take it square in the chin. And I think that that's playing out. There's

395
00:26:57,765 --> 00:27:00,885
Speaker 14:  a lot of excitement still about the company. There's a lot of promise, but

396
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:04,005
Speaker 14:  a lot of questions in The future is a little cloudy I would say.

397
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:07,925
Speaker 1:  Okay. Yeah. I am curious how the message from

398
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:11,125
Speaker 1:  Rivian has changed over the years because like you're talking about, I think

399
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,645
Speaker 1:  If, you rewind to even 2017, there was this sense that like,

400
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:18,005
Speaker 1:  we are going to have EVs, they're going to be everywhere and they're gonna

401
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:21,725
Speaker 1:  be everywhere soon. And everybody was talking about self-driving was gonna

402
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:25,525
Speaker 1:  be the thing we were gonna have like the Uber fleets of self-driving

403
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:29,045
Speaker 1:  cars. And by now the whole world was gonna be different. And obviously that

404
00:27:29,045 --> 00:27:31,445
Speaker 1:  is extremely not what happened. Yeah, I'm,

405
00:27:31,465 --> 00:27:34,565
Speaker 14:  I'm getting PTSD just from you right, saying all of this. Do you

406
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:38,125
Speaker 1:  Remember when 2020 was gonna be the year of the fleet of Uber

407
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,685
Speaker 1:  robot taxis? Oh yeah. Like that was the year they all gave us, it's insane

408
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:45,605
Speaker 1:  in retrospect, but I think if I am Rivian like

409
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:49,165
Speaker 1:  you, you've sort of built up this story over time about what you're doing

410
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:53,125
Speaker 1:  and why it's important. But I know we recently talked to rj, the CEO EO after

411
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,125
Speaker 1:  the most recent launch, which I want to talk about. There's a sense that

412
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:59,005
Speaker 1:  they're just trying to still sort of beat that same drum that they're like,

413
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:02,485
Speaker 1:  this is coming, it's gonna work, everything's gonna be fine. And I feel like

414
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:06,685
Speaker 1:  we haven't done that yet. So like should we keep believing this guy that

415
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,645
Speaker 1:  this is gonna come true?

416
00:28:08,415 --> 00:28:12,125
Speaker 14:  Great question, answer. I don't know. So

417
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:16,245
Speaker 14:  two things I think that obviously electric vehicles are

418
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:20,445
Speaker 14:  not poised to take over all personal transportation in

419
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:21,325
Speaker 14:  the next week or so,

420
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:22,765
Speaker 1:  But by 2020 they will

421
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:27,725
Speaker 14:  Actually, I still have hopes for 2020. No, but it's not coming quite

422
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:31,005
Speaker 14:  as quickly as we thought it was. Which is not to say that it won't come

423
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:34,685
Speaker 14:  eventually. And I think a lot of the serious people

424
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:38,565
Speaker 14:  that are operating this business, a lot of the automakers, the

425
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:42,165
Speaker 14:  people whose jobs it is who get paid lots of money to make these types of

426
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:46,005
Speaker 14:  predictions are saying that electric vehicles are still The future despite

427
00:28:46,445 --> 00:28:50,365
Speaker 14:  a slowdown in sales growth and a lot of investment pullback

428
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:54,165
Speaker 14:  from some of the major companies, factories are getting stalled. Even

429
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,645
Speaker 14:  Rivian is putting a pause on its plan to build a $5 billion factory in,

430
00:28:57,785 --> 00:29:01,445
Speaker 14:  in Georgia as sort of a reflection of this kind of the reality that we're

431
00:29:01,445 --> 00:29:04,205
Speaker 14:  facing today. And that's because of a lot of different reasons. I think

432
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:07,165
Speaker 14:  first and foremost, the industry kind of put all its eggs in one basket

433
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:11,125
Speaker 14:  and brushed maybe a little bit too quickly towards this goal,

434
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:15,365
Speaker 14:  not realizing that both the charging infrastructure was not going to

435
00:29:15,365 --> 00:29:19,165
Speaker 14:  keep a pace with their own desires to sell electric vehicles, but also that

436
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:23,405
Speaker 14:  consumers were not going to be as eager to make the switch as they thought

437
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:25,685
Speaker 14:  they would be. And that's because of a lot of reasons. The the charging

438
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:29,485
Speaker 14:  is not, is not that great. The prices are still really too high

439
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:33,525
Speaker 14:  for a lot of people. Politics have kind of reared their ugly head and have

440
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:37,365
Speaker 14:  complicated a lot of this for some folks. So it's just looking

441
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:41,285
Speaker 14:  a lot messier and it's maybe going to take a little bit longer than people

442
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:44,845
Speaker 14:  thought it was. But that's not to say that eventually the

443
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:48,885
Speaker 14:  majority of cars that are sold in this country and other countries will

444
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:52,045
Speaker 14:  be electric. We're already seeing it in some countries in the, in the world.

445
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:56,365
Speaker 14:  China has been making a lot of progress in pushing up the volume of,

446
00:29:56,465 --> 00:30:00,405
Speaker 14:  of EVs Europe is I think a little bit further behind.

447
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:03,285
Speaker 14:  But they're, they're making a lot of progress as well. Norway. Norway is

448
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:06,845
Speaker 14:  this country where you would think because of how cold it is that nobody

449
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:10,485
Speaker 14:  wants to buy EVs because EVs don't run well in the cold. But yet I think

450
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:14,405
Speaker 14:  over half the count the vehicles sold in that country are electric. Huh.

451
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,365
Speaker 14:  Tesla does very well there.

452
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:16,925
Speaker 1:  Good for Norway. Yeah,

453
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,165
Speaker 14:  That's right. They're showing us the way the Norway seriously

454
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:21,645
Speaker 1:  So,

455
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:24,845
Speaker 14:  I think it's just, it's gonna take a little bit longer. Customers are showing

456
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:28,925
Speaker 14:  a lot of preferences for hybrids for example, they wanna be eased in to

457
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:32,045
Speaker 14:  this hot bath that's being drawn for them by the auto industry. They don't

458
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:34,645
Speaker 14:  wanna just jump right in. That's a terrible image that you can feel free

459
00:30:34,645 --> 00:30:36,285
Speaker 14:  to edit that out. I don't know why I said that. That's,

460
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:38,885
Speaker 1:  It's good. It's, it's a little gross in the way that all of these should

461
00:30:38,885 --> 00:30:40,445
Speaker 1:  be. I think that's, that feels right. So

462
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:44,245
Speaker 14:  Anyway, so amidst all of this you have Rivian a small company with a lot

463
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:48,165
Speaker 14:  of buzz trying to do its best and it's struggling.

464
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:51,285
Speaker 14:  I mentioned the factory, they're losing a lot of money. you know, their

465
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:54,965
Speaker 14:  cash pile is dwindling so they have to make what's called a volume play.

466
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:58,005
Speaker 14:  They need to say, okay, we need to start selling a lot of cars. The cars

467
00:30:58,005 --> 00:31:01,365
Speaker 14:  that they have right now, the truck and, and the SUV are very expensive.

468
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:04,925
Speaker 14:  They're over 70, $75,000. You can get up to 80,

469
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:08,605
Speaker 14:  $80,000 with options just, that's just too expensive for most people to

470
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:12,565
Speaker 14:  afford. So they need to make a play for that middle segment, which is why

471
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:15,765
Speaker 14:  we got the R two reveal a $45,000

472
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:20,045
Speaker 14:  mid-size SUV that can go over 300 miles on a, on a single

473
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,725
Speaker 14:  charge and accelerate from zero to 60 in under three seconds.

474
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:27,965
Speaker 14:  Allegedly So I think that that's why the R two is a very important car

475
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:31,645
Speaker 14:  for Rivian. It's their play at the mass market. They're saying we need to

476
00:31:31,645 --> 00:31:35,285
Speaker 14:  start selling more cars to more people and here is the product that's going

477
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:36,965
Speaker 14:  to be the the one to do it. Yeah,

478
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:40,645
Speaker 1:  The R two strikes me as maybe more than just an important car for

479
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:44,485
Speaker 1:  Rivian, like an important car for this whole industry

480
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,725
Speaker 1:  right now because correct me if I'm wrong, but there's really not a ton

481
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:52,365
Speaker 1:  out there in kind of this price range and this

482
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:55,885
Speaker 1:  sort of specific level of coolness. Like we were talking before we started

483
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:58,325
Speaker 1:  recording about Hyundai and Kia and I actually think what those companies

484
00:31:58,325 --> 00:32:01,805
Speaker 1:  are doing in this space is really interesting. But I, I also think fundamentally

485
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:06,205
Speaker 1:  the people who want a car like this are maybe more likely than most to be

486
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:10,165
Speaker 1:  looking at these cool new brands. I notice Rivian

487
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:14,045
Speaker 1:  on the road, like the, the amount of Rivian that I'm aware of

488
00:32:14,925 --> 00:32:18,045
Speaker 1:  relative to the amount of Rivian that exist is so much higher than any other

489
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:19,965
Speaker 1:  car on the road right now. Do you know what I mean? It's

490
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:23,005
Speaker 14:  Very distinctive. Yeah. It really, it draws attention to itself for sure.

491
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:26,005
Speaker 1:  Right. And I think that's really powerful and important and If, you can do

492
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:29,525
Speaker 1:  that with a car that many people can actually afford.

493
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:33,405
Speaker 1:  That seems like a potentially huge deal. But then there are two questions

494
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:37,045
Speaker 1:  where one is this actually something lots of those people want and then two,

495
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:40,525
Speaker 1:  can Rivian actually get around to making enough of them to make a difference?

496
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:43,405
Speaker 1:  And I do feel like those are both still pretty open questions. Right,

497
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:46,885
Speaker 14:  Absolutely. you know, the fact that the car is not gonna go into production

498
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:50,805
Speaker 14:  until early 2026 I think is also gonna be an issue. I

499
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:53,205
Speaker 14:  mean that's a, that's that might as well be 2000 years from now, you know,

500
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:53,845
Speaker 14:  and, and we

501
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:55,565
Speaker 1:  Might have self-driving by then Who knows exactly.

502
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:59,485
Speaker 14:  So whether or not like, you know, the R two is still generating excitement

503
00:32:59,635 --> 00:33:03,565
Speaker 14:  then is I think, you know, very much an open question. But that's not to

504
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:07,285
Speaker 14:  say that people were very excited, at least the people in my very narrow

505
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:11,525
Speaker 14:  view of social media, very excited about this car. Lots of people

506
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:14,525
Speaker 14:  ver that were kind of tripping over themselves to praise it. They loved

507
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:18,125
Speaker 14:  how it looked. They liked the specs, they liked the price. But you know,

508
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:21,405
Speaker 14:  it's like I said, it's gonna be up to the consumers as to whether or not

509
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:24,565
Speaker 14:  it actually turns out to be a popular one and whether or not Rivian can

510
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:28,525
Speaker 14:  survive long enough to actually put it into production, which is gonna be

511
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:29,765
Speaker 14:  a huge challenge for the company.

512
00:33:29,955 --> 00:33:33,725
Speaker 1:  Yeah. What's been the, the read on the R one T and the R one s

513
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:37,205
Speaker 1:  so far? Are they generally they're very cool when I see them. I like them,

514
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:41,165
Speaker 1:  but what is the kind of broad consensus on whether these are actually good

515
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:41,445
Speaker 1:  cars?

516
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:45,645
Speaker 14:  Yeah, no, people really love them. They have a very dedicated fan base.

517
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:49,085
Speaker 14:  It's very different than the Tesla fan base. It's very interesting If, you

518
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:53,005
Speaker 14:  go on to like Reddit and some of the message boards and listen to, you

519
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:56,165
Speaker 14:  know, sort of like what people talk about and they talk about the cars that

520
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:59,805
Speaker 14:  a lot differently. There's obviously less focus on RJ syringe, the

521
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:03,765
Speaker 14:  CEO as some sort of Lord and Savior, which contrasts very much with what

522
00:34:03,765 --> 00:34:04,285
Speaker 14:  Tesla does,

523
00:34:04,285 --> 00:34:06,005
Speaker 1:  Which I'm assuming RJs pretty happy with.

524
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:09,485
Speaker 14:  I'm sure he is. I'm sure he is. But yeah, these are well loved cars that

525
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:12,925
Speaker 14:  people who own them love them. I think the software

526
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:16,645
Speaker 14:  experience leaves a little bit lacking, but that's typical across the

527
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,925
Speaker 14:  industry right now. The car industry as a whole is kind of fumbling the

528
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:23,805
Speaker 14:  ball when it comes to software. The cars do not have Apple CarPlay or Android

529
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:27,325
Speaker 14:  Auto, which is not a very popular decision and a lot of the owners would

530
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:31,165
Speaker 14:  love to see phone projection brought into the, into their cars. But

531
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:34,605
Speaker 14:  that said, the cars themselves are very delightful, but they're expensive

532
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,765
Speaker 14:  as I mentioned before. And so the segment of the population that actually

533
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:41,485
Speaker 14:  owns these vehicles is still very small. You notice them, they're very

534
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:45,085
Speaker 14:  noticeable, but still, I mean like, you know, your eyes glaze over the Toyota

535
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:49,285
Speaker 14:  Highlanders and the, you know, the Rav fours and the the Honda pilots

536
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:52,885
Speaker 14:  because there are just so many of them. Whereas the Rivian stand out, which

537
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:56,205
Speaker 14:  I think, you know, is a good selling point. But I think it kind of obscures

538
00:34:56,205 --> 00:34:59,165
Speaker 14:  how actually small the, the population of people who own these vehicles

539
00:34:59,405 --> 00:34:59,645
Speaker 14:  actually is.

540
00:34:59,985 --> 00:35:03,085
Speaker 1:  Oh for sure. I'm pretty sure there's just one in my neighborhood, but I just

541
00:35:03,105 --> 00:35:06,125
Speaker 1:  notice it every single time I see it. So I'm like, God, there's a lot of

542
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,445
Speaker 1:  Rivian out there. It, it does seem like, to your point about Tesla, I think

543
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:13,525
Speaker 1:  there's a thing that Rivian did kind of accidentally really

544
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:17,565
Speaker 1:  well it seems like, which is it grew right as Tesla

545
00:35:18,005 --> 00:35:21,725
Speaker 1:  I think was peaking in people's minds as like a cool

546
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:24,485
Speaker 1:  company that was gonna save the world and be good for it. And every time

547
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:28,285
Speaker 1:  I hear RJ talk, you get the sense that he's trying to still

548
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:32,165
Speaker 1:  be optimistic and happy and like tell you about a better world

549
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:36,365
Speaker 1:  in increasing distance from what people perceive about

550
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:39,605
Speaker 1:  Elon Musk. Musk in particular. Right. And Tesla, for better and for worse

551
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:44,085
Speaker 1:  has always been super attached to Elon Musk. So it feels like if I'm

552
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,765
Speaker 1:  Rivian or frankly any of these other companies, like all the people who

553
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:51,485
Speaker 1:  believe in the mission but are falling out of love with Elon Musk, for one

554
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:55,365
Speaker 1:  reason or another, are looking for somewhere to go and

555
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,805
Speaker 1:  care about and put their money in and put their fandom in. Those

556
00:35:57,805 --> 00:36:00,045
Speaker 14:  People are gettable. Those people are all gettable. Do

557
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:02,645
Speaker 1:  You think they are? The other thing that I wondered is like, are we just

558
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:06,605
Speaker 1:  gonna get past that and these are just gonna go back to being cars? Well,

559
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:10,485
Speaker 14:  Yeah, I mean something interesting that RJ said in our interview with, with

560
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:13,725
Speaker 14:  Abigail Bassett or the writer who who interviewed him for us was that,

561
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:18,085
Speaker 14:  you know, he was very impressed with what Tesla has been able to do,

562
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:22,245
Speaker 14:  but that new cars that are Electric sold each year has just reached

563
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:25,965
Speaker 14:  about eight to 9%. And what he was interested in, it was going after

564
00:36:25,995 --> 00:36:29,645
Speaker 14:  that 90% that are still not buying electric

565
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,725
Speaker 14:  vehicles. I mean that's, you know, that's the obvious line that he's gonna

566
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:36,645
Speaker 14:  deliver of course. Which helps sort of sell the prospect of the R

567
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:40,645
Speaker 14:  two as this mass market volume play that they are hoping it will

568
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:44,325
Speaker 14:  be. But yeah, I think that he needs a model three

569
00:36:44,545 --> 00:36:47,485
Speaker 14:  and Rivian is looking for a Tesla model three moment, I think with the R

570
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:50,845
Speaker 14:  two here because you know, Tesla, for a long time there was no

571
00:36:51,235 --> 00:36:54,885
Speaker 14:  guarantee that that company was going to succeed. Right. In fact they very

572
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:58,325
Speaker 14:  nearly failed many times, especially during the model three ramp up. Yeah.

573
00:36:58,325 --> 00:37:01,965
Speaker 1:  Tesla was just as precarious as Rivian is now, like if

574
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:05,845
Speaker 14:  Not more so. Okay. Absolutely. And you know, it was only because of the

575
00:37:05,895 --> 00:37:09,325
Speaker 14:  car's popularity and the company's ability

576
00:37:09,785 --> 00:37:13,725
Speaker 14:  to get it out in the numbers that it did, which started slow

577
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:17,165
Speaker 14:  and then eventually ramped up to a pretty steady clip that people were starting

578
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:21,005
Speaker 14:  to actually get their vehicles most likely at the expense of Tesla's

579
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:24,765
Speaker 14:  employees who have, numerous of them have sued the company for many, many,

580
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:29,285
Speaker 14:  many problems that they've had. But yeah, that prospect I think is still

581
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:33,125
Speaker 14:  up there on top of the hill and I think Rivian sees it up there and it needs

582
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,885
Speaker 14:  to get up to that moment where they're starting to produce cars

583
00:37:36,905 --> 00:37:40,805
Speaker 14:  at a steady clip and people are loving them and buying them, which is, I

584
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:44,565
Speaker 14:  think given the current situation around EV sales and

585
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:48,725
Speaker 14:  the sales growth slow down is why things are, are

586
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:52,925
Speaker 14:  as complicated for the company. So yeah, I think he wants, he wants to

587
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:56,285
Speaker 14:  get to that, to that Tesla moment. What's most interesting to me about the

588
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:59,765
Speaker 14:  image that he's projecting and how RJ talks about the company, especially

589
00:37:59,765 --> 00:38:03,565
Speaker 14:  just in the words that he uses during these events, is they may aspire to

590
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:07,205
Speaker 14:  be like Tesla, but I think they would rather be more like Apple.

591
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:10,165
Speaker 14:  Hmm. The way that they talk and the way that they present their products

592
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:14,045
Speaker 14:  and the way that people talk about their products feels more like Apple

593
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:17,885
Speaker 14:  than Tesla, which is like optimism and the design is very friendly

594
00:38:18,385 --> 00:38:22,045
Speaker 14:  and RJ is out there literally talking about one more thing

595
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:26,605
Speaker 14:  and revealing the R three and the R three X, which is the classic Steve

596
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:30,525
Speaker 14:  Jobs line, although Elon stole it as well I think a couple times. But that's,

597
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:33,725
Speaker 14:  you know, that's all Apple. So, you know, there's been lots of talk should

598
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:37,045
Speaker 14:  Apple buy Rivian Apple's own car project ended?

599
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:40,805
Speaker 1:  I was gonna say, being Apple in cars might not be the thing to shoot for

600
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:41,605
Speaker 1:  here, right.

601
00:38:41,705 --> 00:38:45,525
Speaker 14:  So I think a lot of people sort of see like a possible synergistic moment

602
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:48,645
Speaker 14:  here. Like, oh you need a car, apple, here's, here's a, here's a struggling

603
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:52,565
Speaker 14:  car company that would slot perfectly in with your line of products. I don't

604
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:56,525
Speaker 14:  know if RJ or Tim Cook are talking or whether or not that

605
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:59,165
Speaker 14:  would, that would be appealing to them at all. But you know, there's that,

606
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:00,885
Speaker 14:  that certainly doesn't stop the talk that's out there.

607
00:39:01,315 --> 00:39:04,285
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's an interesting way of thinking about it and it does make me wonder

608
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:08,005
Speaker 1:  if somewhere RJ is sitting around being like, do I need a little more of

609
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:11,205
Speaker 1:  a God complex if I'm gonna make any of this work? Like you get the sense

610
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:14,805
Speaker 1:  that too much God complex bad, but maybe you need a little bit

611
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:18,165
Speaker 1:  like if, if If you don't believe it, how is anybody else going to, you know

612
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:18,365
Speaker 1:  what I mean?

613
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:20,605
Speaker 14:  Right, exactly. Just a little bit of confidence. That's all it takes.

614
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,885
Speaker 1:  That's what I, that's what I tell you all the time. Just a little bit of

615
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:26,605
Speaker 1:  God complex Andy and everything will be fine. But So I, I think this moment

616
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:29,125
Speaker 1:  is so interesting to me for exactly the reason you're describing, right?

617
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:33,005
Speaker 1:  There's the R two and I think I, I also want to know what you think about

618
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:36,485
Speaker 1:  the R three because it was the, it was the one more thing, the sneaky little

619
00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:41,285
Speaker 1:  thing that kind of got everybody really excited. Like my favorite thing

620
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:45,205
Speaker 1:  about the R three reveal was everybody posting pictures of SUVs from the

621
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:48,285
Speaker 1:  nineties that look exactly like the R three, but then everybody being like,

622
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:51,765
Speaker 1:  yeah, I don't care. I still want it. And like there is something about this

623
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:55,445
Speaker 1:  space that people still like feel real feelings about even that

624
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:59,085
Speaker 1:  they're becoming these sort of increasingly mainstream family cars.

625
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:00,205
Speaker 1:  Like Well

626
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:03,285
Speaker 14:  Yeah, and especially because If, you look at some of the design that's out

627
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:06,165
Speaker 14:  there today and just the, the vast majority of cars that people buy that

628
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:09,925
Speaker 14:  it's, it's, there's very little that distinguishes one car from the next.

629
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:12,605
Speaker 14:  They've all totally, I think it's like the industry has all just sort of

630
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:16,285
Speaker 14:  settled on this kind of shape of a car, this kind of

631
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:20,325
Speaker 14:  SUV crossover shape that is the most popular amongst all the cars

632
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:24,605
Speaker 14:  and it kind of has scrubbed out a lot of the, the things that

633
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:28,485
Speaker 14:  made like cars unique and interesting to people. There's just very little

634
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:32,485
Speaker 14:  to differentiate one brand from the other. I mean, you like, yes, you can

635
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:36,685
Speaker 14:  probably notice, you know, A-A-B-M-W grill is different from a Ford from

636
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:40,325
Speaker 14:  a, you know, and the shape of a of a Mercedes is a little bit different

637
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:43,845
Speaker 14:  than maybe a, you know, an Audi. But in the end of it, I think If you

638
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,485
Speaker 14:  sort of did like a blind taste test with like a bunch of people. I think

639
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:50,285
Speaker 14:  that, you know, they would have some difficulty distinguishing one car from

640
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:53,925
Speaker 14:  the next, which is I think a lot of why you see some excitement around Rivian

641
00:40:53,925 --> 00:40:57,005
Speaker 14:  because there is something that's distinctive about it. There is something

642
00:40:57,005 --> 00:41:00,205
Speaker 14:  that's kind of, especially with the R three that's very retro futuristic,

643
00:41:00,205 --> 00:41:04,165
Speaker 14:  right? It has like this kind of hatchback shape that is very

644
00:41:04,485 --> 00:41:08,245
Speaker 14:  reminiscent of like, you know, seventies era VW golfs

645
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:12,325
Speaker 14:  or I saw some people talking about the La Neva, which

646
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:15,925
Speaker 14:  I was not overly familiar with. I'm not like a huge car guy. So I don't

647
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:19,845
Speaker 14:  really go too deep into like the lore, but like the La Neva, I was,

648
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:23,725
Speaker 14:  I didn't like reading lots of articles because I, I'm fascinated now by

649
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:27,605
Speaker 14:  this like little legendary Russian off-road hatchback that is

650
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:31,085
Speaker 14:  like fascinating and it does look a lot like, like the R three X

651
00:41:31,095 --> 00:41:34,205
Speaker 14:  especially, but you, you know, So I think, think that that was appealing

652
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:37,245
Speaker 14:  to people, especially If, you sort of look at, at all of our products, our

653
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,405
Speaker 14:  phones look the same, our cars look the same, our laptops all generally

654
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:43,805
Speaker 14:  look the same, our TVs all look the same. So you just want something that's

655
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:47,365
Speaker 14:  out there that gives you a sense that like, you know, I'm attaching myself,

656
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:51,245
Speaker 14:  I'm making this consumer choice that gives me a little bit of a, an elevate,

657
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:55,205
Speaker 14:  you know, it distinguishes me from my neighbor or somebody else. And

658
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:57,965
Speaker 14:  I think the Rivian kind of offers that to people, which is why they get

659
00:41:57,965 --> 00:41:58,725
Speaker 14:  so worked up about it.

660
00:41:58,795 --> 00:42:01,205
Speaker 1:  Totally. And I'm just, I'm just looking at a picture of the R three right

661
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:04,165
Speaker 1:  now and you're right, and I hadn't really thought about this, that it walks

662
00:42:04,165 --> 00:42:07,965
Speaker 1:  that middle really well where like some of the Electric cars we've seen

663
00:42:08,305 --> 00:42:12,205
Speaker 1:  really for a decade now are all trying to look like they're from like

664
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:15,805
Speaker 1:  a thousand years in The future. And even there's a Hyundai dealership just

665
00:42:15,805 --> 00:42:19,645
Speaker 1:  down the street from me and literally every time like an Ionic five comes

666
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:22,685
Speaker 1:  by, it's like, oh look a spaceship. Like you just, you built a spaceship

667
00:42:22,795 --> 00:42:26,205
Speaker 1:  that now just sits in my neighbor's garage. Like, cool, fine.

668
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:30,525
Speaker 1:  Some people want that, lots of people want a car and it turns out like it,

669
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:34,365
Speaker 1:  it's okay that it can look like a car, but also like it's five

670
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:38,205
Speaker 1:  years from The future, not 5,000. And I think like

671
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:40,805
Speaker 1:  what you're talking about with Rivian rather just like we took a a thing

672
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:44,725
Speaker 1:  people are familiar with and like, and just kind of like jazzed it up a

673
00:42:44,725 --> 00:42:46,925
Speaker 1:  little bit is like maybe exactly what people want.

674
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:51,245
Speaker 14:  Yeah. I think people were, were especially eager to see some, some angles

675
00:42:51,275 --> 00:42:54,925
Speaker 14:  brought back in to the EV design because a, a common

676
00:42:55,245 --> 00:42:58,645
Speaker 14:  critique that you'll hear is that all the EVs look like jelly beans

677
00:42:59,585 --> 00:43:03,565
Speaker 14:  So true is very much what the Teslas look like. And I think you're now

678
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:07,525
Speaker 14:  just now starting to see some pushback against that.

679
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:11,085
Speaker 14:  I think you're seeing it from Rivian. There's another company called Scout

680
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:14,205
Speaker 14:  Motors that's gonna be coming on the scene pretty soon. They're owned by

681
00:43:14,405 --> 00:43:17,845
Speaker 14:  Volkswagen. It's an old, also an old like seventies,

682
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:22,005
Speaker 14:  eighties era off road brand that's that's being revived and, and brought

683
00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:25,765
Speaker 14:  back and made into an all electric brand. And you know, Ford has

684
00:43:25,765 --> 00:43:29,445
Speaker 14:  talked about, you know, maybe electrifying the Bronco. So, you know, I think

685
00:43:29,445 --> 00:43:33,045
Speaker 14:  there you're gonna start to see some differentiation in sort of like what

686
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:36,765
Speaker 14:  these cars look like and Rivian needs to get out there before everyone else

687
00:43:36,765 --> 00:43:40,285
Speaker 14:  because pretty soon that space is gonna get super crowded. Especially the

688
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:44,125
Speaker 14:  mid-size SUV space. I think we've got our fair share of

689
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:47,765
Speaker 14:  crossovers. We've seen them all the Mustang Mach e the model Y,

690
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:51,845
Speaker 14:  the Volkswagen ID four, the Ionic the Kia, and

691
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:55,365
Speaker 14:  now we need to start seeing something that's a little bit roomier but also

692
00:43:55,395 --> 00:43:58,645
Speaker 14:  just something different that looks different that gives somebody the idea

693
00:43:58,645 --> 00:44:02,565
Speaker 14:  that like, okay, this is not just the same jelly bean that I

694
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:04,525
Speaker 14:  I'm I've become used to in the EVs.

695
00:44:05,005 --> 00:44:07,965
Speaker 1:  I will never unsee the jelly bean now and I feel like I hate you for that.

696
00:44:08,205 --> 00:44:11,525
Speaker 1:  Like So I can't, I can't stop thinking about jelly beans that I can, I can

697
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:15,365
Speaker 1:  picture them in my head now, but it does seem like what that puts

698
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:19,245
Speaker 1:  Rivian up for is a very consequential next like

699
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:23,125
Speaker 1:  three years. Because also, like you were saying a minute ago, every

700
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:26,565
Speaker 1:  other car company has been promising to do this kind of stuff over the next

701
00:44:26,565 --> 00:44:30,005
Speaker 1:  few years. So this idea that, you know, Rivian was

702
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:33,645
Speaker 1:  early and had some good ideas and made a cool car with a lot of people like,

703
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:37,645
Speaker 1:  and now it needs to figure out how to make lots of them. Like I

704
00:44:37,645 --> 00:44:40,405
Speaker 1:  think to me at least one of the lessons we've really learned over the last

705
00:44:40,405 --> 00:44:44,325
Speaker 1:  couple years is just how far ahead Tesla was. Rivian strikes me as

706
00:44:44,325 --> 00:44:47,965
Speaker 1:  not nearly that far ahead and in fact is kind of at a moment where like

707
00:44:48,225 --> 00:44:52,205
Speaker 1:  it needs the R two to work in a pretty big way or

708
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:55,925
Speaker 1:  else it's gonna have a pretty big hole to dig out of. Right. Am I being too

709
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:57,925
Speaker 1:  pessimistic about its chances there?

710
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:02,005
Speaker 14:  Not at all. I mean one of the, the stat that jumped out to me the most was

711
00:45:02,005 --> 00:45:05,525
Speaker 14:  that I think in its most recent earnings filing, the company said that it

712
00:45:05,655 --> 00:45:09,405
Speaker 14:  loses $47,000 for every vehicle that it sells.

713
00:45:09,675 --> 00:45:13,605
Speaker 14:  Good Lord. So to give you a sense of how unprofitable things are for Rivian

714
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:17,005
Speaker 14:  right now, that's the price of the R two. That's, you know, basically how

715
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,885
Speaker 14:  much they're, they're planning on charging for this new vehicle. Wow. Which,

716
00:45:19,905 --> 00:45:22,605
Speaker 14:  you know, just goes to show, you know, sort of like how crucial it's going

717
00:45:22,605 --> 00:45:26,405
Speaker 14:  to be for them. There are cash pile is dwindling, they're running outta

718
00:45:26,405 --> 00:45:30,325
Speaker 14:  money, they have this, this factory plan is on pause. you know, they

719
00:45:30,325 --> 00:45:33,365
Speaker 14:  did not sell as many vehicles as they thought they were going to. I think

720
00:45:33,365 --> 00:45:37,285
Speaker 14:  it was around 57,000 last year. And this year they're

721
00:45:37,285 --> 00:45:41,085
Speaker 14:  saying that it's gonna stay pretty flat. They're gonna sell basically the

722
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:44,525
Speaker 14:  same that they did last year, which is not something that investors see

723
00:45:44,565 --> 00:45:48,165
Speaker 14:  a lot of confidence in. Obviously they wanna see growth. This company in

724
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:50,725
Speaker 14:  a company that sells the same number of vehicles that it sold last year

725
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:54,125
Speaker 14:  is not really exhibiting growth in the way that I think a lot of people

726
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:55,445
Speaker 14:  would like to see.

727
00:45:55,905 --> 00:45:59,765
Speaker 1:  Is that because Rivian can't make enough to satisfy demand? Or is it because

728
00:46:00,055 --> 00:46:03,685
Speaker 1:  maybe everybody who wants the stuff that Rivian is already making

729
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:04,565
Speaker 1:  has

730
00:46:04,585 --> 00:46:08,045
Speaker 14:  One. So for a while they were supply constrained, they were not able to

731
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:11,165
Speaker 14:  make as many as people wanted. Okay. And now they are

732
00:46:11,825 --> 00:46:15,525
Speaker 14:  demand constrained because not many, not as many people can afford Right.

733
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:19,205
Speaker 14:  The vehicles as they would like because they are expensive. The ones that

734
00:46:19,205 --> 00:46:23,045
Speaker 14:  they sell now, the R one s and the R one T. So yeah, it's kind of it,

735
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:26,525
Speaker 14:  it's, it's been flipped on them and they're running into these problems

736
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:30,045
Speaker 14:  and all, and it's not just Rivian every, all the companies are sort of in

737
00:46:30,045 --> 00:46:33,565
Speaker 14:  this weird liminal space right now where they need to make more

738
00:46:33,565 --> 00:46:37,325
Speaker 14:  vehicles, they wanna sell more vehicles, but people all don't wanna buy

739
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:39,965
Speaker 14:  as many as they thought they were because the prices are still too high.

740
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:44,485
Speaker 14:  The used market still is mostly Tesla. The,

741
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:48,125
Speaker 14:  the vast majority of the EVs that are for sale that are used are Teslas.

742
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:51,765
Speaker 14:  And those are, you know, those are on the used Tesla, that's 21,000,

743
00:46:51,765 --> 00:46:55,165
Speaker 14:  22,000. That's pretty attractive. And Tesla keeps cutting its own prices,

744
00:46:55,215 --> 00:46:58,525
Speaker 14:  which is also driving other companies to cut prices as well,

745
00:46:59,405 --> 00:47:02,405
Speaker 14:  which reduces margins and makes things more difficult in terms of trying

746
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:05,965
Speaker 14:  to eke out a profit. But the company does say that it will be

747
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:09,605
Speaker 14:  profitable in the fourth quarter of this year. Whether that's, you know,

748
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:13,485
Speaker 14:  EBITDA profitable or operationally whether they have free cash flow. It's

749
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:17,245
Speaker 14:  not exactly clear quite yet. But they say that by pausing

750
00:47:17,245 --> 00:47:21,205
Speaker 14:  this plan to build a factory, which was going to obviously

751
00:47:21,345 --> 00:47:24,885
Speaker 14:  expand their ability to make more cars, they're gonna be able to get the

752
00:47:24,965 --> 00:47:28,045
Speaker 14:  R two out the door faster because they're gonna make it at their factory

753
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:32,005
Speaker 14:  in Illinois. And that's going to be able to reach customers faster, which

754
00:47:32,005 --> 00:47:35,725
Speaker 14:  they say was going to increase their chances of kicking that revenue

755
00:47:35,825 --> 00:47:39,605
Speaker 14:  stream up and, and getting it flowing a lot faster and improving

756
00:47:39,605 --> 00:47:42,045
Speaker 14:  their financial situation. So Yeah, we'll, we'll have to see.

757
00:47:42,265 --> 00:47:46,085
Speaker 1:  So they know they need to be in the game here if they do a Tesla and

758
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:49,965
Speaker 1:  like promise a thing in two years that ships in five years, like they're

759
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:50,685
Speaker 1:  probably dead in the water.

760
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:54,685
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And they've already confronted a lot of issues around wait times

761
00:47:55,025 --> 00:47:58,445
Speaker 14:  and software issues. I mean it's, you know, you can set your clock to it

762
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:01,365
Speaker 14:  in terms of like these companies and the same problems that they're running

763
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:04,725
Speaker 14:  into. Yeah. You would think, you know, seeing the Tesla playbook,

764
00:48:05,265 --> 00:48:08,965
Speaker 14:  you know, you would also see the trade-offs and the, and the pitfalls that,

765
00:48:08,965 --> 00:48:12,485
Speaker 14:  that were along the way. But it's the same thing there. I mean they had

766
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:15,605
Speaker 14:  a problem with their software was bricking the cart for a little while they

767
00:48:15,605 --> 00:48:19,085
Speaker 14:  had to push a software update. I do think that the R two in particular,

768
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:22,125
Speaker 14:  that was the, this is their gonna be their, their model three. This is the

769
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:25,405
Speaker 14:  one that they think is gonna be the high volume seller.

770
00:48:26,145 --> 00:48:29,205
Speaker 14:  The R three is gonna be the icing on the cake. you know, that's gonna be

771
00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:33,125
Speaker 14:  like the fun little cousin to the R two. But that's gonna be the real play.

772
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,965
Speaker 14:  That's, that they hope is gonna be the one that takes over the streets and,

773
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:39,605
Speaker 14:  and transforms them from a small company to hopefully one that's successful

774
00:48:39,665 --> 00:48:41,565
Speaker 14:  and, and has a, a future ahead of it.

775
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:45,445
Speaker 1:  Okay, fair enough. Does it seem like there's any other

776
00:48:45,445 --> 00:48:48,925
Speaker 1:  company kind of, of Vivian's size and

777
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:52,565
Speaker 1:  prestige that might just totally eat its lunch? Yeah,

778
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:56,405
Speaker 14:  Polestar, they're a performance brand. People who like to go vroom, vroom

779
00:48:56,425 --> 00:49:00,285
Speaker 14:  really fast like the Polestar. Sure. Which is cool. They're cool cars. They're

780
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:03,445
Speaker 14:  really cool. They're also kind of apish in a way. They're all white and

781
00:49:03,445 --> 00:49:07,085
Speaker 14:  they have even that they're, it's Google's Android software native. There's

782
00:49:07,085 --> 00:49:08,885
Speaker 14:  just something that's very Apple about, about Polestar.

783
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:12,165
Speaker 1:  But Polestar seems to, to your point, have no particular interest in like,

784
00:49:12,235 --> 00:49:13,525
Speaker 1:  they're not trying to be Toyota.

785
00:49:13,955 --> 00:49:16,325
Speaker 14:  Yeah. No, I don't think so. They're trying to be Mercedes. They're trying

786
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:19,685
Speaker 14:  to be Audi that's, you know, and that's, that's fine. There's a lot of money

787
00:49:19,685 --> 00:49:22,885
Speaker 14:  to be made in that segment as well. Yeah. I think the one, the, what they

788
00:49:22,885 --> 00:49:26,765
Speaker 14:  have to be worried about is Ford and Jeep. And I mentioned

789
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:30,685
Speaker 14:  Scout as well, but I, I, I don't think Scout really has, we don't

790
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:33,445
Speaker 14:  really know what they're gonna be yet. But I do think Jeep in particular,

791
00:49:33,935 --> 00:49:37,485
Speaker 14:  given sort of the similarities and the overlap in the

792
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:41,325
Speaker 14:  customers that are interested in these cars in Rivian vehicles, has the

793
00:49:41,325 --> 00:49:45,125
Speaker 14:  potential to eat Rivian lunch such as you, as you put it. So, and Jeep has

794
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:48,325
Speaker 14:  said that they are coming out, you know, with all electric there's gonna

795
00:49:48,325 --> 00:49:51,765
Speaker 14:  be an all Electric wrangler. There's going to be an all electric Grand Cherokee.

796
00:49:51,765 --> 00:49:55,525
Speaker 14:  They're coming. Also, if, I think if Subaru got off its ass and actually

797
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,285
Speaker 14:  made some good, some good EVs, that could hurt as well. 'cause there I,

798
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:03,325
Speaker 14:  I see some overlap in, in customers there, but Subaru is, is sort of

799
00:50:03,325 --> 00:50:06,725
Speaker 14:  in the same campus as Toyota. They're kind of dragging a little bit on the

800
00:50:06,785 --> 00:50:10,405
Speaker 14:  EV roll rollout. So Rivian still has a, has a possibility here. And

801
00:50:10,765 --> 00:50:13,565
Speaker 14:  I do think that they could have a, a first mover advantage if they, if they

802
00:50:13,565 --> 00:50:16,085
Speaker 14:  can get the R two out and the timeframe that they said that they will.

803
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:19,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And as we've learned, there's nothing like an existential threat to

804
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:21,405
Speaker 1:  your company to get you to actually ship your car.

805
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:25,525
Speaker 14:  It's very motivating. I've heard, I've not experienced it myself, but Yes.

806
00:50:26,385 --> 00:50:29,485
Speaker 14:  And then, yeah, but then like the China question kind of looms over all

807
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:33,405
Speaker 14:  of this, right? Like it will China eventually be able to sell its

808
00:50:33,415 --> 00:50:37,285
Speaker 14:  cheap electric vehicles in the United States is a huge question.

809
00:50:37,595 --> 00:50:41,445
Speaker 14:  Elon Musk has said himself, that would be a devastating blow to the auto,

810
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:45,325
Speaker 14:  to the EV industry in the, in the United States. And BYD in

811
00:50:45,325 --> 00:50:48,405
Speaker 14:  particular, China's biggest automaker has said that they're gonna start

812
00:50:48,605 --> 00:50:52,125
Speaker 14:  building a factory in Mexico, which is right on our doorstep. So,

813
00:50:52,505 --> 00:50:56,325
Speaker 14:  you know, the tariff situation is still very unfriendly to Chinese made

814
00:50:56,585 --> 00:51:00,445
Speaker 14:  EVs the, obviously the policy situation, you know, is very bad

815
00:51:00,445 --> 00:51:04,365
Speaker 14:  for them. It's, it would be very expensive for them to try to sell, but,

816
00:51:04,385 --> 00:51:06,325
Speaker 14:  you know, it's still a, an open possibility.

817
00:51:06,675 --> 00:51:09,525
Speaker 1:  Fair enough. So it's gonna be in a big couple of years, I feel like we've

818
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,685
Speaker 1:  been saying for, for 10 years, it's gonna be a big couple of years, but this

819
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:14,605
Speaker 1:  one feels, this one feels real.

820
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,205
Speaker 14:  Yes. It does feel, I mean, like, I think like we're starting to see a lot

821
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:22,085
Speaker 14:  of pieces fall into play. All the automakers are jumping on the Tesla

822
00:51:22,645 --> 00:51:26,125
Speaker 14:  charging bandwagon. They're all gonna start using Superchargers. They're

823
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,405
Speaker 14:  giving out adapters to their customers. They're gonna have the Tesla port

824
00:51:29,405 --> 00:51:32,685
Speaker 14:  built in natively on the vehicle themselves. There are two, for example,

825
00:51:32,745 --> 00:51:36,685
Speaker 14:  is gonna be the first Rivian vehicle to have the Tesla NACS char charging

826
00:51:36,715 --> 00:51:40,565
Speaker 14:  port in the vehicle. So those vehicles will be able to charge at Tesla supercharger

827
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:44,325
Speaker 14:  stations. That's gonna be huge as we start to see that get adopted

828
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:48,365
Speaker 14:  widespread. And then you've got the incentive that are available,

829
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:52,725
Speaker 14:  the federal EV tax credit can now be taken at the dealership. You

830
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:55,405
Speaker 14:  go into a dealership, you're like, I wanna buy an electric vehicle. Does

831
00:51:55,405 --> 00:51:59,325
Speaker 14:  it meet these criteria? Do I meet the criteria? If so, yes,

832
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:03,245
Speaker 14:  great. You get a $7,500 discount right at the, at the point of

833
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,285
Speaker 14:  sale. That's gonna be huge. Big incentive, I think for a lot of people to

834
00:52:06,285 --> 00:52:09,925
Speaker 14:  buy Electric cars. And I think more of these mass market cars, more of these

835
00:52:09,925 --> 00:52:13,765
Speaker 14:  volume players like the R two, I think the Chevy Blazer went through a bit

836
00:52:13,765 --> 00:52:17,525
Speaker 14:  of a software issue, but now is back and available for sale as well as the

837
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:21,245
Speaker 14:  Chevy Equinox. EV is gonna be coming out. These are common, normal

838
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:25,525
Speaker 14:  everyday vehicles that most people can afford. And if they are sold at a

839
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:29,045
Speaker 14:  price point that car buyers think is right for them, I think you're gonna

840
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:31,645
Speaker 14:  really start to see things shoot up in terms of sales

841
00:52:31,645 --> 00:52:35,005
Speaker 1:  Growth. Fair enough. So yeah, we're, we're gonna get a real answer on Rivian

842
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:38,645
Speaker 1:  here one way or another pretty quickly. Whether this company is like a neat

843
00:52:38,815 --> 00:52:42,325
Speaker 1:  brand that has sold a good story about itself or is a real power player.

844
00:52:42,385 --> 00:52:45,165
Speaker 1:  And it makes me feel better to know that that's coming because I've come

845
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:47,925
Speaker 1:  into this being like, do we know anything about whether Rivian is actually

846
00:52:47,925 --> 00:52:50,805
Speaker 1:  gonna work? And I feel like the answer is we don't, but we're about to.

847
00:52:51,195 --> 00:52:54,045
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And I think that, you know, they have a lot of smart people that work

848
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,365
Speaker 14:  for them, and it, it seems like they have a lot of interesting partnerships,

849
00:52:57,785 --> 00:53:01,605
Speaker 14:  but yeah, there's a lot that's still up in the air. I think that it'll be

850
00:53:01,605 --> 00:53:04,005
Speaker 14:  a really interesting year for them and for, for the rest of the industry.

851
00:53:04,235 --> 00:53:07,885
Speaker 1:  Totally. I do love the headlights. I am normally a gigantic

852
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:09,285
Speaker 1:  antagonist

853
00:56:40,115 --> 00:56:44,065
Speaker 1:  We're back. Let's get to the Hotline as always. The number is 8 6 6

854
00:56:44,305 --> 00:56:48,185
Speaker 1:  Verge one one. The email is Vergecast at The Verge dot com. We love

855
00:56:48,245 --> 00:56:51,345
Speaker 1:  all your questions and we try to answer at least one on the show every week.

856
00:56:51,445 --> 00:56:54,585
Speaker 1:  Before we get into this one, first of all, thank you to everybody who called

857
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:57,465
Speaker 1:  and emailed about TikTok. You had awesome feedback, it was great to hear

858
00:56:57,465 --> 00:57:01,385
Speaker 1:  from you. I promise NELI, Alex and I are all still friends. We're gonna get

859
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:04,985
Speaker 1:  to a bunch of your feedback on Friday. I think I wanna give all that stuff

860
00:57:05,105 --> 00:57:08,625
Speaker 1:  a few more days to play out just because there's a lot happening really fast.

861
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:12,665
Speaker 1:  And one of the things we talked about last week was the huge lack of information

862
00:57:12,665 --> 00:57:15,665
Speaker 1:  that we have and we're starting to get more information. So we're gonna get

863
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:19,465
Speaker 1:  to all of that on Friday. So stay tuned for now we have a question from

864
00:57:19,465 --> 00:57:19,705
Speaker 1:  Terry.

865
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:24,945
Speaker 17:  Hi, this is Terry in Philadelphia and I'm preparing for a professional

866
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:29,025
Speaker 17:  exam and every time I do, I become obsessed about a particular piece

867
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:32,745
Speaker 17:  of technology thinking that if I buy one more gadget that will make the

868
00:57:32,745 --> 00:57:36,585
Speaker 17:  stress of this thing, that will define the arc of my life, or at least what

869
00:57:36,585 --> 00:57:40,345
Speaker 17:  my salary raises this year, just kind of go away. That current

870
00:57:40,345 --> 00:57:44,025
Speaker 17:  obsession are folding phones. I'm a massive man

871
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:47,865
Speaker 17:  with hands that can just hold an entire country ham.

872
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:51,985
Speaker 17:  So it feels like a folding phone would be perfect for

873
00:57:52,725 --> 00:57:56,265
Speaker 17:  the fact that I, I seemingly of the hands of a steel worker despite being

874
00:57:56,425 --> 00:58:00,385
Speaker 17:  an actuary. And one of the thing that gets me is whenever I read a review

875
00:58:00,925 --> 00:58:04,705
Speaker 17:  and one of the dings is this expense is how to

876
00:58:04,705 --> 00:58:08,625
Speaker 17:  interpret the fact that I'm now like a year out from the Fold

877
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:11,745
Speaker 17:  five and the Pixel Fold and I can get them all used for like

878
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:15,865
Speaker 17:  $800 off. Do I just effectively

879
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:20,065
Speaker 17:  add one point to The Verge review score? How?

880
00:58:20,165 --> 00:58:24,105
Speaker 17:  How do you factor in the fact that stuff gets cheaper when you're

881
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:27,985
Speaker 17:  interpreting the review on a review site? Any insight

882
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:30,505
Speaker 17:  would be great. Love the show. Stay classy.

883
00:58:31,165 --> 00:58:35,105
Speaker 1:  All right, this is one of my favorite and one of the most relatable questions

884
00:58:35,105 --> 00:58:38,625
Speaker 1:  we've gotten on The Vergecast in a long time. Allison Johnson's here to help

885
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:39,345
Speaker 1:  me answer it. Hi Allison.

886
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:40,265
Speaker 18:  Hello.

887
00:58:40,965 --> 00:58:43,705
Speaker 1:  Do we love Terry? I feel like we love Terry. Yes. I feel like the thing where

888
00:58:43,725 --> 00:58:46,305
Speaker 1:  I'm like I have a big project to do, let me buy a gadget that will solve

889
00:58:46,305 --> 00:58:49,505
Speaker 1:  all of my problems is extremely, extremely relatable. I

890
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:53,265
Speaker 18:  Feel seen. Yeah. Like this planner

891
00:58:53,485 --> 00:58:55,105
Speaker 18:  is gonna do everything for me.

892
00:58:56,345 --> 00:58:59,185
Speaker 1:  I, I have brought you here 'cause I think there are two questions inside

893
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:03,025
Speaker 1:  of this question, both of which I wanna talk about. One is for

894
00:59:03,045 --> 00:59:06,985
Speaker 1:  our massive man friend Terry with huge country ham

895
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:10,065
Speaker 1:  hands is about foldable phones. The right call, that's question number one.

896
00:59:10,065 --> 00:59:13,945
Speaker 1:  And then question number two which I wanna get to is how do you think about

897
00:59:13,995 --> 00:59:17,825
Speaker 1:  price in a review like that and how should we think about price of these

898
00:59:17,825 --> 00:59:21,765
Speaker 1:  things over time as they inevitably come down? But let's just start with

899
00:59:21,785 --> 00:59:25,525
Speaker 1:  the beginning thing. The foldable phones question is about foldable phones

900
00:59:25,525 --> 00:59:28,245
Speaker 1:  gonna solve all of Terry's problems forever for the rest of his life.

901
00:59:29,185 --> 00:59:32,925
Speaker 18:  Yes Terry, I have great news. All you need to do is

902
00:59:33,255 --> 00:59:37,165
Speaker 18:  spend upwards of $800 on a gadget. No, I think there's

903
00:59:37,165 --> 00:59:40,645
Speaker 18:  something there. I think that's fair to,

904
00:59:41,065 --> 00:59:45,005
Speaker 18:  to think that you have a phone that's like normal size when

905
00:59:45,005 --> 00:59:48,405
Speaker 18:  you wanna do something kind of fiddly or you just want more screen space,

906
00:59:48,915 --> 00:59:52,725
Speaker 18:  open it up and you have like almost a tablet. So I think

907
00:59:52,725 --> 00:59:55,485
Speaker 18:  that's real. I think Terry is is on the right track.

908
00:59:56,225 --> 01:00:00,125
Speaker 1:  I'm curious what your experience has been with foldable phones in terms

909
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:03,565
Speaker 1:  of like the productivity they enable. Because for me,

910
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:07,285
Speaker 1:  I've used most of my foldable experiences with the Pixel Fold at this point.

911
01:00:07,465 --> 01:00:11,285
Speaker 1:  And what I have found is that as a thing for

912
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:15,045
Speaker 1:  just more screen real estate, whether it's like I have a PDF that

913
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:19,005
Speaker 1:  isn't, you know, scaling well to my phone or whatever or a thing I want

914
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:22,965
Speaker 1:  to actually mark up with a pen, foldable phones. Awesome. The thing that

915
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:26,565
Speaker 1:  has not worked for me that I have found very frustrating is I hoped that

916
01:00:26,565 --> 01:00:29,685
Speaker 1:  typing would be better on about foldable phones. 'cause you can do the split

917
01:00:29,885 --> 01:00:32,125
Speaker 1:  keyboard thing and sort of type with two thumbs on a bigger screen and it

918
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:36,085
Speaker 1:  would be better. I have not found that to be the case at all, but I'm

919
01:00:36,085 --> 01:00:38,845
Speaker 1:  curious what you, what your experience has been like, what do you get from

920
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:39,805
Speaker 1:  the bigger screen that way?

921
01:00:40,275 --> 01:00:43,965
Speaker 18:  Yeah, I, for me it is the productivity stuff and like the,

922
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:48,285
Speaker 18:  the scenario I keep coming back to is like I just hate

923
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:51,805
Speaker 18:  tabbing around between apps and you just always end up doing it where I'm

924
01:00:51,805 --> 01:00:55,565
Speaker 18:  like planning dinner with friends and you're in the little chat

925
01:00:55,705 --> 01:00:59,605
Speaker 18:  app, you gotta switch to Google Maps, you gotta look at a PDF of the

926
01:00:59,925 --> 01:01:03,685
Speaker 18:  restaurant's menu, the foldable phones let you put

927
01:01:03,705 --> 01:01:07,125
Speaker 18:  two things on the screen at once and like hold two thoughts in your head

928
01:01:07,225 --> 01:01:11,165
Speaker 18:  at one time. I so appreciate them for that. I'm will

929
01:01:11,405 --> 01:01:14,925
Speaker 18:  occasionally indulge in like a game that's like

930
01:01:15,185 --> 01:01:19,005
Speaker 18:  fun on a bigger screen, but for me it's definitely the

931
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:22,965
Speaker 18:  like, oh I can just like breathe and like put all these things out

932
01:01:22,985 --> 01:01:26,925
Speaker 18:  or like I have a little Spotify and a little window and do lingo. It's just

933
01:01:26,925 --> 01:01:30,085
Speaker 18:  like a little bit more of a a computer

934
01:01:30,695 --> 01:01:34,365
Speaker 18:  experience than a phone experience. I agree. Typing is weird.

935
01:01:34,665 --> 01:01:35,485
Speaker 18:  It feels strange.

936
01:01:35,955 --> 01:01:39,005
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I keep thinking I'm gonna get used to it but I haven't. But the, you're,

937
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:41,885
Speaker 1:  you're totally right. The two apps side by side thing, especially for something

938
01:01:41,885 --> 01:01:45,845
Speaker 1:  like research and note taking is really useful just for me being

939
01:01:45,845 --> 01:01:49,565
Speaker 1:  able to have like the browser on one side and a Google doc or my

940
01:01:49,765 --> 01:01:53,685
Speaker 1:  notes app or whatever on the other is amazing. And I never noticed how

941
01:01:53,885 --> 01:01:57,525
Speaker 1:  annoying it is to constantly switch between apps on my

942
01:01:57,545 --> 01:02:01,285
Speaker 1:  iPhone as I have after using the Pixel Fold a bunch. So I'm with you. So,

943
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:04,605
Speaker 1:  okay Terry you should buy it. It's gonna be amazing. Let's talk about prices

944
01:02:04,675 --> 01:02:08,565
Speaker 1:  because I think you were on this show when all this stuff first

945
01:02:08,565 --> 01:02:12,445
Speaker 1:  came out and I think we, we more or less agree $1,800 is a

946
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:15,525
Speaker 1:  ludicrous amount of money to pay for a phone. Like If you want to and you

947
01:02:15,525 --> 01:02:19,285
Speaker 1:  have the money go with God, right? But $1,800 is

948
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:23,365
Speaker 1:  a tremendous amount of money, but these things are now a

949
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:27,085
Speaker 1:  year or in the the Galaxy folds case sometimes a couple of years old,

950
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:30,485
Speaker 1:  the prices are coming way down. Does that make you think differently about

951
01:02:30,485 --> 01:02:30,645
Speaker 1:  them?

952
01:02:31,395 --> 01:02:35,125
Speaker 18:  This is the question I ask myself every day. Just even when you

953
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:38,965
Speaker 18:  consider when one of these phones comes out, especially Samsung

954
01:02:39,755 --> 01:02:43,525
Speaker 18:  will, they'll throw a new phone at you If you trade

955
01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:46,925
Speaker 18:  something in or If you sign up on your carriers,

956
01:02:47,545 --> 01:02:51,045
Speaker 18:  you promise to pay them thousands of dollars over the next three years,

957
01:02:51,045 --> 01:02:54,925
Speaker 18:  they'll throw a phone at you. So what does a phone really cost is a question.

958
01:02:55,445 --> 01:02:59,325
Speaker 18:  I think there is kind of a calculus as you know, when you

959
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:02,885
Speaker 18:  get to like a year out, the prices will kind of come down.

960
01:03:02,885 --> 01:03:06,605
Speaker 18:  Sometimes, I, think Foldables have been a little more

961
01:03:06,885 --> 01:03:10,285
Speaker 18:  stubborn. But the thing to kind of balance that with is always

962
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:14,605
Speaker 18:  like, what do we think is coming out next is it's gonna be a

963
01:03:14,785 --> 01:03:18,725
Speaker 18:  big year, like a big leap forward this year. I

964
01:03:18,725 --> 01:03:22,605
Speaker 18:  would argue that the Galaxy Z Fold four to five,

965
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:26,845
Speaker 18:  like not much changed there. And If, you If you were

966
01:03:27,035 --> 01:03:30,965
Speaker 18:  looking at a, at a Z Fold four and skip the five.

967
01:03:31,355 --> 01:03:34,725
Speaker 18:  That probably would've been a good call there. I think there's some interesting

968
01:03:34,725 --> 01:03:38,445
Speaker 18:  things coming up this year where the, the Pixel Fold

969
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:42,405
Speaker 18:  looks like it might get a little thinner and kind of a,

970
01:03:42,845 --> 01:03:46,645
Speaker 18:  a less like rectangular shape where it's, it's like real

971
01:03:46,645 --> 01:03:50,365
Speaker 18:  kind of squat and wide sort of maybe

972
01:03:50,835 --> 01:03:54,685
Speaker 18:  something like the one plus open, which I think has the best

973
01:03:54,945 --> 01:03:58,245
Speaker 18:  format of like when it's closed and when it's open.

974
01:03:58,945 --> 01:04:02,525
Speaker 18:  So all that's to say, I don't know, I don't know how you think about the

975
01:04:02,525 --> 01:04:06,365
Speaker 18:  price you do wanna factor in like the years of security

976
01:04:06,395 --> 01:04:10,365
Speaker 18:  updates in the os updates that your promise, like you,

977
01:04:10,745 --> 01:04:14,445
Speaker 18:  if you're buying a model that's a year out of date, you have to minus one

978
01:04:14,445 --> 01:04:18,005
Speaker 18:  year on all those things. Those are, you know, and I keep that in mind,

979
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:21,965
Speaker 18:  but I would kind of keep an an ear to the ground on like what's coming

980
01:04:21,985 --> 01:04:25,805
Speaker 18:  up and then see what the deals are now and just don't forget

981
01:04:25,805 --> 01:04:29,765
Speaker 18:  that when the new phone comes out you, you can usually do pretty well.

982
01:04:30,315 --> 01:04:33,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's, it's a tricky one because I think my go-to advice

983
01:04:34,105 --> 01:04:38,045
Speaker 1:  on all technology for a long time has been buy

984
01:04:38,105 --> 01:04:42,045
Speaker 1:  the most expensive, best newest thing you can afford and then keep it

985
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:45,605
Speaker 1:  as long as humanly possible. And that I, that advice I mostly stand by

986
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:49,405
Speaker 1:  except that I obviously recognize that many people can't for

987
01:04:49,645 --> 01:04:52,805
Speaker 1:  whatever reason afford the best and biggest and newest thing. Right. And

988
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,485
Speaker 1:  I think particularly with foldable phones, that's really complicated because

989
01:04:55,485 --> 01:04:59,205
Speaker 1:  there isn't, like you're saying that sort of graceful scaling that happens

990
01:04:59,215 --> 01:05:02,565
Speaker 1:  where like If, you wanna buy an iPhone 13 in this

991
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:06,485
Speaker 1:  the year 2024. I think that's a perfectly valid thing to do.

992
01:05:06,995 --> 01:05:09,965
Speaker 1:  It's not what I would do because of my aforementioned belief in buying the

993
01:05:09,965 --> 01:05:12,605
Speaker 1:  new thing and then keeping it forever. But the iPhone 13 is a really good

994
01:05:12,605 --> 01:05:16,445
Speaker 1:  phone. There is no version of that three years ago

995
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:20,125
Speaker 1:  in foldable funds and they're getting better so much faster and they're so

996
01:05:20,185 --> 01:05:23,525
Speaker 1:  not yet mature that and like as soon as you brought up the Pixel Fold, I'm

997
01:05:23,525 --> 01:05:26,885
Speaker 1:  like, I just think about how much better like the Pixel watch got from one

998
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:30,645
Speaker 1:  to two, like the Fold, Google has a long history of making like kind of

999
01:05:30,645 --> 01:05:34,605
Speaker 1:  NELI first things and then pretty good second things. And so even at

1000
01:05:34,605 --> 01:05:38,565
Speaker 1:  a thousand dollars, like are you gonna buy that phone and then

1001
01:05:38,565 --> 01:05:41,725
Speaker 1:  in six months be like, I should have just bought the

1002
01:05:42,085 --> 01:05:45,365
Speaker 1:  $1,800 one because it's dramatically better Or should you have waited six

1003
01:05:45,365 --> 01:05:47,765
Speaker 1:  more months after that, but then at that point you're waiting for the folder.

1004
01:05:47,915 --> 01:05:50,045
Speaker 1:  It's like, it's just a forever, it's

1005
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:51,845
Speaker 18:  Like a hamster wheel. Yeah,

1006
01:05:51,845 --> 01:05:55,565
Speaker 1:  It really is. But I'm curious for you as a reviewer, like this is something

1007
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:59,125
Speaker 1:  I've struggled with over the years in reviewing products is how much to think

1008
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:02,845
Speaker 1:  about what they cost. And I think sometimes it's really obvious, right? Like

1009
01:06:02,845 --> 01:06:06,805
Speaker 1:  we, we, I I made a big show of yelling $3,500

1010
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:10,445
Speaker 1:  a lot when we talked about the Vision Pro. But in terms of like as you're

1011
01:06:10,445 --> 01:06:14,085
Speaker 1:  reviewing a phone about foldable phones or even just, you know,

1012
01:06:14,225 --> 01:06:18,005
Speaker 1:  the most other kind of thousand dollar ish phones, do you spend a lot of

1013
01:06:18,005 --> 01:06:21,325
Speaker 1:  time thinking about the price as you're reviewing it?

1014
01:06:21,725 --> 01:06:25,485
Speaker 18:  I do. Kind of trying to bear in mind like the, the way that

1015
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:29,085
Speaker 18:  most people buy phones, especially in this country is looks very different

1016
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:32,725
Speaker 18:  that, you know, nobody's walking into Verizon and just putting a thousand

1017
01:06:32,725 --> 01:06:36,445
Speaker 18:  dollars on the table. So that kind of figures in, but you know,

1018
01:06:36,445 --> 01:06:39,845
Speaker 18:  even when that's the case, like you have a whole lot of capital

1019
01:06:40,235 --> 01:06:43,725
Speaker 18:  with like, if you're ready to, to switch to a new

1020
01:06:44,205 --> 01:06:47,765
Speaker 18:  wireless carrier, you can like easily get a thousand dollars phone out of

1021
01:06:47,765 --> 01:06:51,685
Speaker 18:  that. So like just the, just kind of keeping in mind

1022
01:06:51,685 --> 01:06:55,325
Speaker 18:  the weight of that that you know, anybody's potentially

1023
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:59,085
Speaker 18:  putting down on one of these devices. And I do think of them

1024
01:06:59,665 --> 01:07:03,285
Speaker 18:  as they're kind of a moment in time, the review So

1025
01:07:03,605 --> 01:07:07,325
Speaker 18:  I, I bear in mind like the prices of the other things

1026
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:11,445
Speaker 18:  out there and they may be discounted, they may have some

1027
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:15,165
Speaker 18:  special deal going, but I think

1028
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:19,285
Speaker 18:  I come back to the M-S-R-P-A lot as kind of an apples to apples

1029
01:07:19,595 --> 01:07:23,405
Speaker 18:  like gut check of, you know, this costs this

1030
01:07:23,405 --> 01:07:27,005
Speaker 18:  amount of money for real and this one cost this

1031
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:31,165
Speaker 18:  or is that a good deal? And there there's just a lot of like 40

1032
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:35,165
Speaker 18:  chess going on in, in my mind somewhere. but it all

1033
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:39,165
Speaker 18:  has to kind of come out in a way that hopefully makes sense

1034
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:39,565
Speaker 18:  to people.

1035
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:43,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I was used to try to think about like, okay, If, you gave this to me

1036
01:07:43,925 --> 01:07:47,565
Speaker 1:  as a gift and it was free, would I like it? And that's kind of one version

1037
01:07:47,565 --> 01:07:50,685
Speaker 1:  of the question. And then the other one is, is it worth the cost? And the

1038
01:07:50,685 --> 01:07:54,605
Speaker 1:  problem with phones is, is they exist literally on every single part of

1039
01:07:54,605 --> 01:07:55,885
Speaker 1:  the spectrum between the two.

1040
01:07:55,885 --> 01:07:56,685
Speaker 18:  Yeah, right. It's,

1041
01:07:56,685 --> 01:07:57,725
Speaker 1:  It's so complicated.

1042
01:07:57,945 --> 01:07:58,165
Speaker 18:  Yes.

1043
01:07:58,425 --> 01:08:02,125
Speaker 1:  In a way that like I pretty much know what an iPad costs, right? Like

1044
01:08:02,225 --> 01:08:05,805
Speaker 1:  you just have no idea what your next phone is gonna cost in the

1045
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:09,565
Speaker 1:  strangest way. But okay, let's, let's answer a couple of quick questions

1046
01:08:09,565 --> 01:08:12,125
Speaker 1:  here for Terry and then we're gonna get outta here. Question number one is,

1047
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,245
Speaker 1:  should Terry just buy an iPad

1048
01:08:13,785 --> 01:08:14,685
Speaker 18:  Ooh? Well

1049
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:15,925
Speaker 1:  Like is that the better idea?

1050
01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:21,485
Speaker 18:  I, you know, there's something to that. I'm sort of coming around

1051
01:08:21,485 --> 01:08:25,325
Speaker 18:  to this idea of like, wouldn't it be nice to have more gadgets that

1052
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:29,125
Speaker 18:  are just good at doing the thing that you want them to do? Like we've just

1053
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:32,925
Speaker 18:  for concept, I know we've spent a lot of time like cramming as many

1054
01:08:32,925 --> 01:08:36,565
Speaker 18:  things as we can into a phone and like that's fun, but sometimes,

1055
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:40,685
Speaker 18:  like we were both looking at this like standalone voice recorder

1056
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:45,245
Speaker 18:  today, which is like, what a novel idea. Your phone can do that. But

1057
01:08:45,465 --> 01:08:49,205
Speaker 18:  anyway, that's a long way to say like that's an option. And if the

1058
01:08:49,205 --> 01:08:52,725
Speaker 18:  kinds of things he wants to do with it are just

1059
01:08:53,025 --> 01:08:56,325
Speaker 18:  better on a tablet than, you know, think about a tablet.

1060
01:08:56,915 --> 01:09:00,445
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I, I've been debating this ever since I, I first heard Terry's question

1061
01:09:00,465 --> 01:09:02,885
Speaker 1:  and I think the thing I've come around to is the question is do you need

1062
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:06,245
Speaker 1:  to have it in your pocket? Right? Because Terry is like, I'm a big guy, I

1063
01:09:06,245 --> 01:09:09,045
Speaker 1:  have big hands. I if, if the answer is like, I want to carry this thing around

1064
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:12,485
Speaker 1:  with me all the time, foldable phones because like you can tell yourself

1065
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:15,085
Speaker 1:  you're gonna carry an iPad with you all the time. I have told myself that

1066
01:09:15,085 --> 01:09:18,485
Speaker 1:  many times. It's just never true. The idea that I, I'm just gonna have it

1067
01:09:18,485 --> 01:09:22,405
Speaker 1:  with me all the time. Not true. But if you're like, I'm mostly at

1068
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:26,365
Speaker 1:  home and I want a thing that I can like sit with for my reading and research

1069
01:09:26,365 --> 01:09:29,725
Speaker 1:  or whatever, I think the iPad's the better advice. The the other thing is,

1070
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:34,045
Speaker 1:  if Terry wants about foldable phones, which one would you recommend

1071
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:38,245
Speaker 1:  right now? And, and the thing for Terry is Terry does care about the

1072
01:09:38,245 --> 01:09:42,125
Speaker 1:  price but, but we are here to tell Terry all things considered here is

1073
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:44,045
Speaker 1:  the one we think you should buy. What do you think the answer is right now?

1074
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:48,205
Speaker 18:  Yeah, I like my general pick right now

1075
01:09:48,465 --> 01:09:52,125
Speaker 18:  is the Samsung is the Galaxy Z, Fold five. I think

1076
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:55,405
Speaker 18:  they're just kind of, they kind of had a head start and they've figured

1077
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:59,205
Speaker 18:  out a couple more things. you know, with the durability and with the

1078
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:03,365
Speaker 18:  software that I think Google and OnePlus, those are really the

1079
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:07,005
Speaker 18:  only two other options in the us They're still kind of figurine

1080
01:10:07,185 --> 01:10:11,165
Speaker 18:  out. I say that with the asterisk of like the Z Fold five

1081
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:12,285
Speaker 18:  form factor might

1082
01:10:41,525 --> 01:10:42,245
Speaker 18:  a new one pretty

1083
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:18,205
Speaker 1:  sometime, even if it doesn't come out till the fall. So you, you'll at least

1084
01:11:18,205 --> 01:11:21,085
Speaker 1:  have kind of a hint about what's coming. But I think I'm with you that If,

1085
01:11:21,085 --> 01:11:24,685
Speaker 1:  you wanna buy a phone that is both a year old and likely to still be good

1086
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:28,525
Speaker 1:  for a while. It seems like Samsung is probably the safest choice. Yeah. Even

1087
01:11:28,525 --> 01:11:30,005
Speaker 1:  if it does feel like a TV remote,

1088
01:11:30,545 --> 01:11:34,365
Speaker 18:  It does, but it, it's gonna solve all of Terry's problems,

1089
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:35,165
Speaker 18:  I'm pretty sure.

1090
01:11:35,335 --> 01:11:39,325
Speaker 1:  There we go. Terry, good luck on all of your endeavors with your foldable

1091
01:11:39,325 --> 01:11:42,125
Speaker 1:  phones. I hope that helped Allison. Thank you as always. Thank

1092
