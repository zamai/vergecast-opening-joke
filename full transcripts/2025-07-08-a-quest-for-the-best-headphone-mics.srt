Description: On this episode of The Vergecast, we kick off Hot Girl Vergecast Summer with a classic Vergecast segment: the mic test. Guest host Victoria Song is joined by Vergecast producers Andru Marino and Erick Gomez to see how the Nothing Headphone 1, Sony WH-1000XM6, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort Ultra hold up against what’s possibly the noisiest street in Brooklyn. 

After that, Victoria is joined by Ladder CEO Greg Stewart to talk about what it takes to build a successful strength training app — especially for people just starting out. As it turns out, it’s quite challenging, between curating playlists, accommodating users’ different access to equipment, skill levels, and preferences for coaching styles. (And maybe, some occasional beef with Peloton?)

Lastly, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com) about AI fitness summaries, whether people actually like them, what’s frustrating about them, and what scenarios they might actually be useful for.

00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:07,495
Speaker 2:  Hello and welcome to the inaugural episode of Hot Girl VERGE Cast

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:11,415
Speaker 2:  Summer, the flagship podcast where the hot girls of The Verge

4
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:15,375
Speaker 2:  replace our stinky old men for a summer. No, we

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:19,175
Speaker 2:  love you. We love you. We're you're not stinky and you're not

6
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:23,255
Speaker 2:  old. But anyway, I'm your friend Victoria Song,

7
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:27,015
Speaker 2:  And I am filling in this week for David Pierce now that he's officially

8
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:31,255
Speaker 2:  on parental leave. I'll be your guest host for the next two weeks, and

9
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:34,415
Speaker 2:  then I will be handing it off to another one of my beautiful colleagues.

10
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:38,455
Speaker 2:  It's gonna be a really fun summer And I think you guys are totally gonna

11
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:42,415
Speaker 2:  have a blast with us. But today the itinerary for today's

12
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:46,375
Speaker 2:  show is we are gonna be testing out the mics from a bunch of different

13
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:50,095
Speaker 2:  over your headphones, and I'm bringing in our producers, Andrew Marino and

14
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:53,095
Speaker 2:  Erica Gomez to help me out with that because they're the Audio kings

15
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,815
Speaker 2:  And I'm just the wearable lady. You know what? That's not true. I test a

16
00:00:57,815 --> 00:01:01,215
Speaker 2:  bunch of fitness headphones, so I'm an audio queen in my own right.

17
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:05,015
Speaker 2:  And then, you know, once we're done with the microphone test, we're gonna

18
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,535
Speaker 2:  talk to the CEO of a strength training app called Ladder

19
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,735
Speaker 2:  isn. The reason why is because it turns out it's very difficult to

20
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:16,015
Speaker 2:  build the strength training app. Trust me, I've tested dozens

21
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:19,615
Speaker 2:  cardio apps, really easy strength training.

22
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:24,775
Speaker 2:  For whatever reason, it's a lot more challenging any who I really enjoy

23
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:28,655
Speaker 2:  ladder. So I wanted to get him on and to talk about

24
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:32,615
Speaker 2:  the challenges of making one. That's actually pretty good. And once

25
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:36,535
Speaker 2:  we're done with that, we are going to take a question from The Vergecast

26
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,695
Speaker 2:  hotline. So you know all that coming up today and more. But

27
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:44,555
Speaker 2:  first I wanna know what you're gonna listen to on these over

28
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:48,355
Speaker 2:  your headphones once we figure out which one is the winner from the

29
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:51,875
Speaker 2:  mic test. I personally will be listening to the entire

30
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,635
Speaker 2:  soundtrack of K-Pop Demon Hunters, because I was not

31
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:59,595
Speaker 2:  expecting it to rock as hard as it does, but it does let

32
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:03,195
Speaker 2:  me know if you watch this movie, what your favorite song from it is and why

33
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:07,355
Speaker 2:  it's take down because that song is Chef's Kiss. Don't, don't Come At

34
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:11,075
Speaker 2:  Me. If you like Soda Pop Anyw, who we'll be right back.

35
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,755
Speaker 2:  And we're back. So one of the most signature

36
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:06,075
Speaker 2:  vergecast segments is the in the field microphone test. And in the

37
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:09,795
Speaker 2:  past we've tested microphones from consumer electronics like earbuds,

38
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:13,475
Speaker 2:  laptops, smart glasses, the whole shebang. So now let's do

39
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:17,755
Speaker 2:  over the ear headphones. So audio quality obviously a

40
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:21,395
Speaker 2:  huge top concern when you're buying over the ear headphones, but we often

41
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:25,275
Speaker 2:  forget to think about microphone quality, AKA, how you're gonna

42
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:29,155
Speaker 2:  sound when you talk to people over the phone on these headphones. So

43
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:33,075
Speaker 2:  to test this, we sent our good friend Andrew Moreno into the field

44
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:36,875
Speaker 2:  with a bunch of new over ear headphones. And to help me out, we have

45
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,795
Speaker 2:  our producer Eric Gomez. How you doing Eric?

46
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:41,235
Speaker 4:  Good, ve how you doing?

47
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,795
Speaker 2:  I'm good. And how are you doing Andrew?

48
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:48,355
Speaker 6:  Hi, ve. I'm good. I'm out in deep in Brooklyn

49
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,635
Speaker 6:  on a street corner. It's one that I take phone

50
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:56,195
Speaker 6:  calls a lot from, So I think this is a good place to do headphone tests.

51
00:04:56,705 --> 00:05:00,035
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I can definitely hear all the cars behind you, which is, it's pretty

52
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:00,275
Speaker 4:  Noisy.

53
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:04,315
Speaker 2:  Yeah, which is peak New York City vibes. So

54
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,475
Speaker 2:  which headphones are we gonna test first?

55
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:10,555
Speaker 6:  Okay, so we have four headphones. Today we're gonna do the

56
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,315
Speaker 6:  AirPods Max, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra, the

57
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:18,155
Speaker 6:  Sony WH 1000 XM Sixes,

58
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:22,195
Speaker 6:  and the New Nothing Headphone one just was

59
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:25,355
Speaker 6:  announced this on July 1st. So we'll get to

60
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:29,555
Speaker 6:  try all those out in this field. Let's start with maybe

61
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:32,955
Speaker 6:  the nothing ones so we can hear 'em right off the bat.

62
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:37,035
Speaker 2:  Love to hear what nothing has in store. Is it something,

63
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,035
Speaker 2:  is it nothing? We'll find out.

64
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:43,475
Speaker 6:  Okay, now I'm wearing the Nothing Headphone one.

65
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:48,425
Speaker 6:  Look at, look at this interesting design. Okay, how do I sound out in

66
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:48,945
Speaker 6:  the field now?

67
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:53,385
Speaker 2:  You sound not too bad. I can't hear the giant

68
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,665
Speaker 2:  garbage truck that was behind you or any of the hustle and bustle.

69
00:05:57,595 --> 00:06:01,405
Speaker 2:  Your voice sounds a little, I don't know, compressed. A little like

70
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:05,565
Speaker 2:  muffled. Not the worst, but also clearly

71
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:08,965
Speaker 2:  the the You're clearly on a pair of something. Yeah,

72
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:13,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah. It's doing a great job of canceling out all the

73
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:17,005
Speaker 7:  noise behind you when you were on your MacBook microphone

74
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:20,965
Speaker 7:  before you could hear everything and now it's completely canceling out all

75
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,805
Speaker 7:  the, the noise. And it's doing actually a good job of

76
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:28,365
Speaker 7:  separating your voice from the, the background noise. However,

77
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,605
Speaker 7:  yeah, like we said, it, it is kind of, kind of

78
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:35,085
Speaker 7:  compressing your voice a little bit, modulating a little bit, but at least

79
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:35,765
Speaker 7:  we could hear you.

80
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:40,365
Speaker 6:  Oh, okay. So, so there's like some sirens that just went

81
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,245
Speaker 6:  off while you were talking. Did you hear any of that?

82
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:45,045
Speaker 2:  Not, not a single thing. Wow. So that's

83
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:48,405
Speaker 6:  Pretty cool. Okay. That's pretty good. Okay, so we have to say

84
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:52,325
Speaker 6:  that we did attest of this before,

85
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:57,045
Speaker 6:  earlier this week, And I wore the headphones backwards

86
00:06:57,905 --> 00:07:01,365
Speaker 6:  and it sounded horrible and you could not understand anything I was saying.

87
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:02,325
Speaker 6:  Is that correct? It

88
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:05,765
Speaker 2:  Was garbage. That is correct. It was the absolute garbage. Like it was just

89
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:09,165
Speaker 2:  super underwater. You could only hear, hear part of every third word.

90
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,205
Speaker 2:  It was, it was, it was not great.

91
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,085
Speaker 6:  Okay, now I have,

92
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:16,925
Speaker 6:  how do I sound?

93
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:20,485
Speaker 2:  You sound awful. God. Yeah. Oh my God.

94
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Let me just turn these around and actually see if they sound bad

95
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:26,995
Speaker 6:  when I wear them wrong. Sure.

96
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:31,635
Speaker 6:  Okay. How do I sound

97
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:33,595
Speaker 2:  With you? Sound awful. Okay.

98
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:34,715
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah, really bad.

99
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:38,755
Speaker 2:  It's kind of funny because I think lots of people don't always check

100
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:42,515
Speaker 2:  whether they're wearing the right and the left ear cup in the right

101
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:46,475
Speaker 2:  direction. So this is a one of those things where it's like if you have these

102
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:50,275
Speaker 2:  headphones and someone tells you they can't hear shit, you

103
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:52,035
Speaker 2:  might be wearing them the wrong way.

104
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:56,435
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So I noticed the reason why this happens is because the way they fold

105
00:07:56,505 --> 00:08:00,115
Speaker 6:  down and then when you take them out of the case, the right

106
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:04,475
Speaker 6:  is on your left hand and the left is on your right hand. Ah. So then

107
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:08,435
Speaker 6:  when you pick them up, you have to turn them and then put them on, which

108
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:12,035
Speaker 6:  is very confusing And I think that's why I got mixed up there.

109
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:16,315
Speaker 6:  But I am glad to hear now that we bore them correctly, they sound

110
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:16,555
Speaker 6:  better.

111
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:19,995
Speaker 7:  Yeah, totally. We could totally have a conversation right now, despite all

112
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:23,315
Speaker 7:  the, the traffic going up behind you, you're coming in pretty, pretty clear.

113
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,675
Speaker 7:  I'm actually pretty impressed. Did you truly

114
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,915
Speaker 2:  Unintelligible when you were the, the wrong way versus Yeah, you know,

115
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:33,195
Speaker 2:  pretty decent when you have it on the right way. So that's kind of nuts.

116
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:37,275
Speaker 2:  And like, these are 3 99, 2 99, not 3 99.

117
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:41,195
Speaker 2:  I think the design looks pretty neat from afar. I don't know how you feel

118
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:43,115
Speaker 2:  about it up close and how does it feel in your head?

119
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:47,395
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I feel a little silly wearing 'em outside. They look make me look like

120
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:51,315
Speaker 6:  a robot, like with these like designs under here, Andrew

121
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:51,475
Speaker 6:  bought

122
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:53,555
Speaker 7:  4,000. Definitely got that cyborg look going on right now.

123
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. But I, I do really like the buttons on the back.

124
00:08:57,685 --> 00:09:01,365
Speaker 6:  There's like this nice cool scrolly wheel thing and

125
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:05,085
Speaker 6:  there's a little paddle switch that you can like skip songs and stuff.

126
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:09,005
Speaker 6:  And I guess there's a button over here on the side that you can

127
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:12,885
Speaker 6:  like assign to your voice assistant if you wanna do that. Yeah. Too. It's

128
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,765
Speaker 6:  a pretty cool design, but it's a little silly. I like the black version.

129
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:20,405
Speaker 6:  Those actually look a lot cooler than these ones. I think these stick out

130
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:20,605
Speaker 6:  a lot

131
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,485
Speaker 7:  More. The designs is definitely very divisive for sure.

132
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:27,445
Speaker 2:  It's a fashion statement. Yeah. Good. If you love making a fashion statement,

133
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:31,325
Speaker 2:  maybe not so great if you're in a boardroom. I I don't Unless you

134
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,165
Speaker 2:  have a fellow boardroom full of ai bots, which

135
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:39,125
Speaker 2:  I don't know, we live in a dystopia. That could be true. That's

136
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,325
Speaker 2:  any who shall we move on to the next pair of headphones? Yeah,

137
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,565
Speaker 6:  Which one should we try next?

138
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,325
Speaker 2:  Let's do the Sonys. Those are, those are also relatively new to Okay, cool.

139
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:52,005
Speaker 6:  Okay. Currently talking from the Sony W

140
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:56,165
Speaker 6:  1000 XM sixes, I have said this model number enough that

141
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,645
Speaker 6:  I know what they're called now.

142
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:01,645
Speaker 2:  The Sony alphabet soup. I dunno, you sound pretty good.

143
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The, the noise again, can't hear anything behind you, your voice is

144
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:06,445
Speaker 2:  pretty clear.

145
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:10,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's actually pretty remarkable continuing to

146
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:14,325
Speaker 7:  be impressed by these headphones and their ability to cancel out so much

147
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:18,245
Speaker 7:  background noise and, and traffic noise. I think your voice is slightly less

148
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:22,685
Speaker 7:  compressed and modulated, so it's a little more natural sounding.

149
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:26,365
Speaker 7:  But yeah, you're, you're coming in pretty, pretty clear

150
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:30,165
Speaker 6:  Wearing these it sounds like. I am in a room,

151
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:36,085
Speaker 6:  I hear more of the sounds outside though than I did in

152
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:39,885
Speaker 6:  the last one, but it makes it sound like the sounds are in a

153
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,325
Speaker 6:  box. I don't know if that makes sense.

154
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:44,725
Speaker 7:  It's kind of interesting you say that because it, your voice is coming across

155
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:48,525
Speaker 7:  as if you're in a small space and it's kind of like you're getting some reflections

156
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:52,765
Speaker 7:  off a wall or something as if it's like, like a visa, like

157
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:55,485
Speaker 7:  a boardroom or a small phone booth or something.

158
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:59,845
Speaker 7:  So it's, it's adding a little bit to your voice to make it a little bit more

159
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:02,045
Speaker 7:  natural sounding, which is pretty interesting.

160
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:06,565
Speaker 6:  Interesting. Okay, so these use six mics for a

161
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,245
Speaker 6:  voice pickup compared to four and the last time there's 12

162
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:14,085
Speaker 6:  mics total on these. So I, I thought that was interesting. So

163
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:18,245
Speaker 6:  these are pretty, I mean Sony is such an audio focused company, so it makes

164
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:18,485
Speaker 6:  sense.

165
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:22,645
Speaker 2:  All right, cool. So that's the Sony's, we got those. Let's

166
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:25,285
Speaker 2:  do the AirPods Max next. Okay.

167
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:29,165
Speaker 6:  Alright, now I'm calling from the Apple AirPods Max.

168
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:30,765
Speaker 6:  How do I sound here?

169
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:34,245
Speaker 2:  You know what's surprising is how much more I hear of your surroundings.

170
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:38,325
Speaker 2:  There was like a, one of those big, I dunno, was a bust, was

171
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,965
Speaker 2:  it a truck of sun coin? It, it was, you know, like it sounded like a, an

172
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:44,885
Speaker 2:  old man going. Definitely heard that in

173
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,605
Speaker 2:  the background. Voice wise,

174
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:52,525
Speaker 2:  I think it's okay, but maybe not the most amazing.

175
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:56,525
Speaker 2:  Not as good as the Sonys or the nothings that we've heard so far. I can definitely

176
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:57,765
Speaker 2:  hear that truck behind you though.

177
00:11:58,155 --> 00:12:02,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah, you're coming in a little muffled. I think these are letting

178
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:05,645
Speaker 7:  in more of the natural ambience of whatever's going on behind you, but

179
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:09,925
Speaker 7:  at the same time it's also cutting into your voice so you kind of sound

180
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:13,885
Speaker 7:  like you're on a zoom call, like that kind of Okay.

181
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:18,045
Speaker 7:  Underwater type of effect that you get sometimes from like the

182
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:21,485
Speaker 7:  Fidelity audio over the internet. Yeah. So

183
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:25,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I found this in our last test, like a lot more

184
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,125
Speaker 6:  background noise came through And maybe my voice sounded a little more

185
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:33,085
Speaker 6:  realistic, but it also just took in everything else.

186
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:37,125
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's, it's not as compressed as the Sonys or the nothings, but you

187
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,005
Speaker 7:  sound a little thin, I guess is the best way to describe

188
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:40,965
Speaker 6:  It. Sure, sure. Okay.

189
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:44,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I guess if you want someone to know that you're outside,

190
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:48,645
Speaker 2:  this is what you want. But, you know, you don't wanna sound horrible on

191
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:52,565
Speaker 2:  the call, but you wanna say, oh god, someone's

192
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,245
Speaker 2:  breaking and they need to oil those breaks.

193
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,045
Speaker 6:  Oh wow. You heard that? Okay.

194
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:59,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we did. Yeah, yeah, definitely. It was completely silent for the last

195
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:02,845
Speaker 2:  two headphones, but I can definitely hear what's going on outside.

196
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,925
Speaker 6:  Okay. Yeah. With you right now, there there are three microphones for voice

197
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:09,485
Speaker 6:  pickup with eight microphones for active noise cancellation.

198
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:12,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah, you heard all that,

199
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:15,765
Speaker 2:  Huh? And it's, it's interesting because this is I think the most expensive

200
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,245
Speaker 2:  pair of, of headphones that we have in, in this test. They're

201
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:22,965
Speaker 2:  5 49 5. Yeah. So the, the others like

202
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:26,725
Speaker 2:  the nothings were 2 99 and the Sonys were 4 49.

203
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:30,765
Speaker 2:  So you were paying the most to hear

204
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:33,685
Speaker 2:  trucks behind you when you're outside,

205
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,965
Speaker 6:  Do you hear any of the wind noise? It's, it's getting pretty windy.

206
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:39,085
Speaker 7:  Yes. A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Get some of that rustling. Yeah,

207
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:43,405
Speaker 6:  I would say that Apple's AirPods throw but earbud

208
00:13:43,475 --> 00:13:46,925
Speaker 6:  ones, I think they sound great for voice calls. I use those all the time

209
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,925
Speaker 6:  for voice calls. So it's funny like if you were to pick

210
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:54,725
Speaker 6:  these over the earbuds, I would pick the

211
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:58,045
Speaker 6:  earbuds just because like you get so much more use outta 'em because the

212
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,285
Speaker 6:  voice calls are better. And that's my opinion though.

213
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,445
Speaker 2:  I mean you don't get as much of a fashion statement as you do with the max.

214
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:08,605
Speaker 2:  Sure. I mean these are cool. I definitely feel they are they they're a very

215
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,445
Speaker 2:  specific look. I see people in New York City all the time on the subway wearing

216
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:15,965
Speaker 2:  them. So I guess it's a matter of what you're looking for,

217
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:20,565
Speaker 2:  but cool. No, we're onto our final pick The vs. Quiet

218
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:23,885
Speaker 2:  Comfort Ultra. Let's see how those do.

219
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:28,085
Speaker 6:  Alright, now I'm calling on the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra.

220
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:30,925
Speaker 6:  How do I sound? What do you hear? What do you don't hear?

221
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:35,085
Speaker 2:  You know, when you were talking I could hear the stuff around you a lot

222
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:39,205
Speaker 2:  more. Yeah. Then when you're not talking, it

223
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:43,045
Speaker 2:  sounds a lot damper elbow Now I do hear those

224
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:47,005
Speaker 2:  police sirens hear the sirens going by. I do hear the sirens going by

225
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:51,845
Speaker 2:  and you sound a little compressed, but okay. Not awful.

226
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:55,445
Speaker 2:  You're intelligible a little bit like you're in an echo chamber underwater

227
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:56,245
Speaker 2:  a little bit.

228
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:59,845
Speaker 6:  So these did the best in our previous test.

229
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,885
Speaker 6:  Okay. Yeah. You hear this siren going by here?

230
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, depo.

231
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,605
Speaker 7:  It, it's interesting. I think it's like it's bringing, it's bringing up the

232
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:13,405
Speaker 7:  noise floor every time you speak and then once you stop talking it, it

233
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:15,285
Speaker 7:  kind of dampens it down a little bit more.

234
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:18,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I noticed this before too.

235
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:19,045
Speaker 2:  Wow. God,

236
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:21,285
Speaker 6:  Sorry.

237
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:25,605
Speaker 2:  Wow. No, it's, it's accurate but I do think it's gonna depend on

238
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:29,405
Speaker 2:  what context you're using these headphones and like how much you want

239
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:33,205
Speaker 2:  other people to know where you are. I don't want anyone to know anything

240
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:36,725
Speaker 2:  about where I am at any given point in time. I wanna be like a mystery. Yeah.

241
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:40,485
Speaker 2:  Enigmatic. So that's not something that I would love

242
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:44,565
Speaker 2:  personally. But you are intelligible on the call. You do

243
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:48,445
Speaker 2:  kind of sound like you're like, if, if you had a swimming pool

244
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:51,405
Speaker 2:  and you got rid of all the water and you were kind of standing in the swimming

245
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:54,165
Speaker 2:  pool, there's a little bit of that effect going on, I think, but Oh,

246
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:54,845
Speaker 6:  Echoey.

247
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:58,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a little echoey me. It's adding some kind of

248
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:01,685
Speaker 7:  processing to the voice where it's kind of letting it ring a little bit more

249
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:05,605
Speaker 7:  than it would normally or naturally. Yeah. And

250
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:09,565
Speaker 7:  it, it's it's, yeah, I'm picking up the birds as well. Yeah. Okay. I'm not

251
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:13,285
Speaker 7:  picking up any low end at all. Just really high frequency

252
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,765
Speaker 7:  Sure places. Yeah.

253
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:16,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that makes sense.

254
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:18,405
Speaker 2:  You got some yappy birds near you.

255
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:21,525
Speaker 6:  Okay. So what do you, what do you think who wins?

256
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:25,045
Speaker 2:  I think my number one pick would be the Sonys actually.

257
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:27,045
Speaker 8:  Yeah. The voice calls.

258
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah. What what? Oh my god, what do you think?

259
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:34,965
Speaker 7:  I was gonna say the same thing. It's, I think it's a close tie

260
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:38,845
Speaker 7:  or, or at least a very tight race between the Sonys and the nothings. I think

261
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:42,765
Speaker 7:  it would be Sony number one, nothing. Number two, the Bose

262
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:45,445
Speaker 7:  number three and AirPods max number four.

263
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:49,125
Speaker 6:  Lemme put them on one more time and we'll just say goodbye.

264
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:53,525
Speaker 6:  Okay. And then Aaron, I'm back on the, nothings just the comparison

265
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,005
Speaker 6:  still sound pretty good or still easy to hear me. Second place

266
00:16:58,005 --> 00:16:59,245
Speaker 6:  you're gonna say. Yeah,

267
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:03,165
Speaker 2:  I'm still gonna say I think second place just because you're a

268
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:06,885
Speaker 2:  little loud and a little more compressed sounding to my ear

269
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,805
Speaker 2:  at least. Yeah. Than you were on the Sonys, but it's, it's a lot

270
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:14,725
Speaker 2:  closer than it was on our last test when the nothings were

271
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:18,445
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I, I think we are just coming to realize,

272
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:23,405
Speaker 7:  you know, that these headphones for the most part do a pretty good job of

273
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:27,125
Speaker 7:  canceling out background noise, you know, some better than others and

274
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:30,885
Speaker 7:  that's always gonna add a little bit of color and compression to your voice.

275
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:34,725
Speaker 7:  But you know, as, as long as we're able to hear you, I think that's a good

276
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:38,565
Speaker 7:  trade off. Yeah. You know, because otherwise you're not gonna

277
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:41,765
Speaker 7:  wanna wear these and take a call because you're always gonna have complaints

278
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:45,085
Speaker 7:  from other people saying that they can't hear you. Or if you can, you know,

279
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:48,925
Speaker 7:  go to a quieter space, you know, you can confidently go out with a,

280
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:52,965
Speaker 7:  you know, with the Sonys or the the nothing headphones and take a call and

281
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,245
Speaker 7:  and not worry about it at all. Yeah, pretty

282
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:59,045
Speaker 2:  Much. Yeah. Yeah. And I think another thing we were saying is just the scenarios

283
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,765
Speaker 2:  that you're in, 'cause they might perform slightly differently. I think you

284
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:06,445
Speaker 2:  sounded like you were in the apiary section where all the birds were yapping

285
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:10,405
Speaker 2:  in the zoo a little bit when you added in like

286
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:14,285
Speaker 2:  outdoor noise with the bows. So I think it's important to think about

287
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:18,205
Speaker 2:  where you're gonna be using these headphones when you know prime day. Prime

288
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:19,805
Speaker 2:  day is happening, right. So

289
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:24,925
Speaker 2:  yeah, I was gonna go buy myself a pair of bows but maybe you'll get a

290
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:29,005
Speaker 2:  pair of the Sonys just 'cause I think they did better all

291
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:32,285
Speaker 2:  around. Oh wow. Now I have to think hard. I don't like having to think hard.

292
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,045
Speaker 2:  That's very rude

293
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:37,645
Speaker 6:  For voice calls the Sony beat out. But for sound quality

294
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:42,645
Speaker 6:  I'm always going back to the AirPods max between those

295
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:44,445
Speaker 6:  four. Yeah, I do think but

296
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:25,415
Speaker 2:  So we're back and you know, I test all the wearables and fitness

297
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:28,895
Speaker 2:  tech at The Verge And I gotta tell you I've tested a million of them

298
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:33,175
Speaker 2:  and it is really hard to find something that I personally feel like

299
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:37,295
Speaker 2:  gets strengths training down Pat And I'm not even exaggerating when I say

300
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:41,095
Speaker 2:  I've tested a million of them. I it it's, it's probably

301
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:44,335
Speaker 2:  close hundreds at the very least and strength training is just

302
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:48,855
Speaker 2:  so hard to get down pat. And I think ladder of all the apps

303
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:52,495
Speaker 2:  that I've tried has definitely gotten the closest to the point where I

304
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:56,335
Speaker 2:  almost feel like I enjoy lifting weights, which if you've read

305
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:59,655
Speaker 2:  my reviews, you know how much I hate lifting weights. Like I know it's good

306
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:03,615
Speaker 2:  for me but I hate it. In any case, I wanted to call up

307
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:07,295
Speaker 2:  CEO Greg Stewart and have him tell me why this app

308
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:11,375
Speaker 2:  is actually good at this. So here's that.

309
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:15,425
Speaker 2:  I really wanted to talk to you about Ladder because

310
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:19,905
Speaker 2:  you know, personally speaking I have always struggled with strength

311
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:23,025
Speaker 2:  training. We have like approximately

312
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:27,465
Speaker 2:  40,000 running in cardio apps. Why is strength

313
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:29,185
Speaker 2:  training so hard to get right?

314
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:33,475
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I think I think to start, it's not just strength training, it's delivering

315
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:37,635
Speaker 10:  workouts or programming through an app experience. And I think

316
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:41,435
Speaker 10:  if you look at the spectrum of apps and content,

317
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:46,165
Speaker 10:  it's really designed as a library of almost

318
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:49,725
Speaker 10:  scattered random workouts which you have to navigate

319
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:53,965
Speaker 10:  yourself and it's really hard to figure out the right style,

320
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:58,205
Speaker 10:  what your programming should look like versus your goals, how to

321
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:02,045
Speaker 10:  start a new modality like strength training. And so people will

322
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:06,085
Speaker 10:  gravitate towards what they're comfortable with or what they know.

323
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:10,285
Speaker 10:  And a lot of times that leans to cardio, which is great, all

324
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:14,285
Speaker 10:  movement is great but it doesn't really help you start a new

325
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:17,925
Speaker 10:  consistent routine versus completing

326
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:22,205
Speaker 10:  a workout any workout in a particular day. And

327
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:25,805
Speaker 10:  there's lots of resources out there but it's hard to find one

328
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:29,445
Speaker 10:  source of truth. What we invented

329
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:33,965
Speaker 10:  was a system and that system's been designed to do two

330
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:37,885
Speaker 10:  things to get you the desired outcomes and body composition that

331
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:41,605
Speaker 10:  comes with teaching you the movements and programming to get there

332
00:24:42,225 --> 00:24:45,805
Speaker 10:  and to keep you excited and having fun, which is

333
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:49,445
Speaker 10:  motivation, which becomes consistency. When we designed

334
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:53,605
Speaker 10:  the experience we, we looked at personal training and

335
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:57,925
Speaker 10:  personal training from our perspective is the best way

336
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:02,245
Speaker 10:  to get into strength training, to get into fitness, to maintain a consistent

337
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:05,925
Speaker 10:  routine. But it's really hard to get access to that. It's really expensive,

338
00:25:06,115 --> 00:25:09,645
Speaker 10:  it's hard from a timing perspective, it's just not really

339
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:13,565
Speaker 10:  accessible for most people. But the anchors of

340
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:17,165
Speaker 10:  personal training were super interesting and relevant to us and how we saw

341
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:20,765
Speaker 10:  that were really three kind of core pillars.

342
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:24,525
Speaker 10:  Programming. So you know what to do, it's designed by an expert,

343
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:28,125
Speaker 10:  it's demystifying strength training, so no matter what style you're looking

344
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:32,005
Speaker 10:  for or level of strength training, you're coming in with coaching.

345
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:35,445
Speaker 10:  So you've got someone there to guide you through each workout, someone to

346
00:25:35,445 --> 00:25:39,045
Speaker 10:  answer your questions and accountability. So really trying to

347
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:42,805
Speaker 10:  replicate the feeling of having a coach there.

348
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:47,525
Speaker 2:  Our listeners who may not know what the ladder experience is

349
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:51,245
Speaker 2:  like, can you give them a quick rundown of what ladder

350
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,165
Speaker 2:  looks like for them? Yep,

351
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:57,685
Speaker 10:  Absolutely. So again, it starts with our core goal of giving

352
00:25:57,685 --> 00:26:01,485
Speaker 10:  you a plan and demystifying strength training for beginners

353
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:05,365
Speaker 10:  or or any level. And for us it starts with bringing on

354
00:26:05,465 --> 00:26:09,365
Speaker 10:  the best coaches, true experts in strength coaching and the

355
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:12,965
Speaker 10:  specific modality that they represent, which we test before they

356
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:16,805
Speaker 10:  join the company. So for the consumer we spend a lot of time

357
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:21,005
Speaker 10:  constantly tweaking maybe what you experienced this matching algorithm

358
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:25,005
Speaker 10:  to make sure that we're asking you the right questions, understanding

359
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:27,925
Speaker 10:  who you are, what you're solving for, where you're coming from a fitness

360
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:31,805
Speaker 10:  perspective, beginner or advance and mapping you

361
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:35,925
Speaker 10:  to the right program based on all those inputs. We

362
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:39,805
Speaker 10:  have a wide range of of programs we call 'em teams. Some are geared

363
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:42,925
Speaker 10:  towards folks who are new to strength training, others are geared to those,

364
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,565
Speaker 10:  those are advanced coaches represent personas and personalities

365
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,525
Speaker 10:  and we use that to match to the right user who's coming in

366
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:54,925
Speaker 10:  in the app itself. Like we're over emphasizing real coaching

367
00:26:54,985 --> 00:26:58,925
Speaker 10:  and proper form. So the value prop is we give you playing, we remove

368
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:02,645
Speaker 10:  all the guesswork that comes with strength training. You have movement videos

369
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:06,805
Speaker 10:  featuring your coach who's performing each exercise. We make it really

370
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:10,205
Speaker 10:  easy to review and preview those moments before you get started.

371
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:14,525
Speaker 10:  But you can think about it as a system. It isn't just a

372
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:18,245
Speaker 10:  a basket of content and you're choosing your own adventure. We're figuring

373
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:21,845
Speaker 10:  out who you are. We're mapping each to the right program. That program is

374
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:25,365
Speaker 10:  called a team. That team has a coach that coaches actually programming

375
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:29,085
Speaker 10:  workouts every week that are progressive so that every day

376
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:32,405
Speaker 10:  you're looking to work out you know exactly what you should be doing and

377
00:27:32,405 --> 00:27:36,005
Speaker 10:  you can have confidence that they're building on top of each other and actually

378
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:39,965
Speaker 10:  purposely designed by an expert that is in line with

379
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:42,085
Speaker 10:  the goals that that you are solving for.

380
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I don't wanna touch on like a lot of what you talked about there because

381
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:52,725
Speaker 2:  one of my biggest struggles, like I'm in the fitness tech space, I

382
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:55,125
Speaker 2:  work out, I know how important like

383
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:59,715
Speaker 2:  conditioning and strengths training and mobility work is, but

384
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:04,075
Speaker 2:  you know there's, it's just so hard to, to be like, oh I'm a

385
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:08,115
Speaker 2:  runner. Let me Google or ask chat GPT what the best program for me

386
00:28:08,135 --> 00:28:11,995
Speaker 2:  is, oh no I have to look up the proper form. Oh no, I have to think

387
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:15,955
Speaker 2:  about do I have access to a gym? Do I have home

388
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:19,835
Speaker 2:  equipment? Yep. Oh I am injured, I don't

389
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:22,835
Speaker 2:  have that equipment. What can I swap it out for?

390
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:27,715
Speaker 2:  What's a modifier the way that ladder does it? When I

391
00:28:27,715 --> 00:28:30,615
Speaker 2:  first tried it I was like, oh this makes sense,

392
00:28:31,615 --> 00:28:35,495
Speaker 2:  this is like a lot easier for me now because you can

393
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:39,415
Speaker 2:  swap out a move that you don't like that made me much more likely

394
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,615
Speaker 2:  to stick with it. So I was wondering like how do

395
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:47,575
Speaker 2:  you get those concepts into an app? Like

396
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:51,135
Speaker 2:  how, how do you develop that process? Because I was like, oh I didn't even

397
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:54,455
Speaker 2:  know that was something I wanted. Even the concept

398
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:58,895
Speaker 2:  of training blocks for people who've never used ladder, you have six week

399
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:02,175
Speaker 2:  training blocks. That was something I struggled with when I was trying to

400
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:06,975
Speaker 2:  do this all on my own, saving money, not going to get a

401
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:10,975
Speaker 2:  personal trainer in person. So just would love to touch on

402
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:12,175
Speaker 2:  on those aspects.

403
00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:16,335
Speaker 10:  Yeah, on on the blocks, like if you were to hire a personal trainer, they

404
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:19,895
Speaker 10:  would think about increments of time that you're working towards

405
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:23,975
Speaker 10:  so it wouldn't just be a random Monday workout. They would say,

406
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:27,895
Speaker 10:  alright, over the next six or eight weeks or 12 weeks we're gonna work

407
00:29:27,895 --> 00:29:31,655
Speaker 10:  on developing something very specific and your workouts are gonna build

408
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:35,455
Speaker 10:  to that. And we use the strength series to create

409
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:39,815
Speaker 10:  a similar experience. They have specific goals that you

410
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:43,605
Speaker 10:  are working on. It has a beginning and an end so it doesn't feel like this

411
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,605
Speaker 10:  never ending experience or never ending road. Like you

412
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:51,445
Speaker 10:  have a moment in time, very specific thing that you're focused on,

413
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:55,325
Speaker 10:  which is different at each team and you're doing it alongside a whole bunch

414
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:58,165
Speaker 10:  of people who are going through the same thing as you.

415
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:02,285
Speaker 10:  When we think about launching a new team or even

416
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:06,405
Speaker 10:  managing our teams, we're hyperfocused on the

417
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:10,525
Speaker 10:  persona, the person that is relevant to that team

418
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:14,365
Speaker 10:  and we work backwards based on what we're learning

419
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:18,525
Speaker 10:  from that quiz. So we have millions of people going through that

420
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,485
Speaker 10:  quiz where we help you match to a program. But we also use that

421
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:26,445
Speaker 10:  quiz to figure out what are the gaps in personas or

422
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:30,605
Speaker 10:  training styles that aren't well served by our current coaching

423
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:34,045
Speaker 10:  roster. And we're in a fortunate position where we don't have to go launch

424
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:38,125
Speaker 10:  new coaches and teams to grow. We'll launch a new coaching team

425
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:41,525
Speaker 10:  when it's very clear that there's an underserved persona.

426
00:30:41,985 --> 00:30:45,605
Speaker 10:  So someone very specific, similar goals, training style

427
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:49,885
Speaker 10:  that isn't currently met by our, by our coaches. So we

428
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:53,645
Speaker 10:  have like a very specific person mind when we're working with

429
00:30:53,745 --> 00:30:57,285
Speaker 10:  our coaches and programming reflects that. So

430
00:30:57,435 --> 00:31:01,365
Speaker 10:  upfront when we're working with a coach, whether it's launching a new

431
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:05,125
Speaker 10:  team or or constantly iterating, it's very, very clear

432
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:08,685
Speaker 10:  where's this person working out? What equipment do they have access to?

433
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:12,205
Speaker 10:  Where are they on their fitness journey? How many days a week are they working

434
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:16,005
Speaker 10:  out? Do they need more motivation or they're looking for

435
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:19,965
Speaker 10:  technical form and training advice. And if you

436
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:23,245
Speaker 10:  go across our teams, they're extremely different.

437
00:31:23,885 --> 00:31:27,765
Speaker 10:  I think the, the fact that we didn't launch ladder with

438
00:31:27,765 --> 00:31:31,285
Speaker 10:  like one core face that represented the brand, like you'll see in a lot

439
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:34,885
Speaker 10:  of other fitness products, we created this concept of ladder

440
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:39,085
Speaker 10:  under ladder lives teams and teams are a wide range of

441
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:42,605
Speaker 10:  personas. If you go to Limitless with Coach Kelly,

442
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,485
Speaker 10:  that's an advanced gym goer, that's a woman who's going to the gym five

443
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:49,085
Speaker 10:  or six days a week, knows exactly how to navigate around

444
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:54,045
Speaker 10:  equipment and machines and is looking for expert

445
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,405
Speaker 10:  programming and a coach who really understands the technical fundamentals

446
00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:00,885
Speaker 10:  and is gonna convey that in their programming. If you join

447
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:05,845
Speaker 10:  a line, it has a yoga infused influence. So someone who might not be coming

448
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:09,525
Speaker 10:  from a ton of strength training experience wants to incorporate that but

449
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:13,165
Speaker 10:  wants to have some of the familiarity and benefits of

450
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:16,845
Speaker 10:  incorporating a a yoga routine. So we're very, very

451
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:20,645
Speaker 10:  particular on the, the person that these coaches

452
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,285
Speaker 10:  are serving within these teams and we're constantly working with that to

453
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:28,125
Speaker 10:  make sure that our assumptions are correct and that we have the right

454
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:31,845
Speaker 10:  person in mind and we're using our data to inform that process. So

455
00:32:32,265 --> 00:32:35,925
Speaker 10:  for us it comes from not not having a blanketed view of

456
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:40,205
Speaker 10:  this is just workouts and a fitness consumer, it's who is this person,

457
00:32:40,215 --> 00:32:42,885
Speaker 10:  where are they coming from, what are they solving for? What equipment do

458
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:46,445
Speaker 10:  they have? Where are they training? And then building a team around that,

459
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:51,205
Speaker 2:  You know, this this new era of fitness apps, it kind of

460
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,685
Speaker 2:  sort of feels like your mini content media production

461
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:58,485
Speaker 2:  companies and that comes with its own challenges. Like,

462
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:03,165
Speaker 2:  you know, one of the core tenets of strength training is you kind of have

463
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:06,605
Speaker 2:  to do the same few movements over and over again

464
00:33:06,915 --> 00:33:10,845
Speaker 2:  with heavier weights to progress. It's very easy to get bored when

465
00:33:10,845 --> 00:33:13,885
Speaker 2:  you're doing that. So like how do you keep that

466
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:19,005
Speaker 2:  interesting? Yeah, obviously the the the trainers, they're,

467
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:22,405
Speaker 2:  they're thinking about that too. They're putting that in and then, you know,

468
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:25,645
Speaker 2:  how do you make the decision of do we go for

469
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:29,925
Speaker 2:  curated playlists that are instructors create

470
00:33:30,465 --> 00:33:34,245
Speaker 2:  or do we go for your own music? Which I,

471
00:33:34,365 --> 00:33:38,125
Speaker 2:  I deeply appreciate the ability to listen to my own playlist on ladders,

472
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:42,005
Speaker 2:  like love Apple Fitness plus Love Peloton,

473
00:33:42,385 --> 00:33:46,325
Speaker 2:  but sometimes I'm like your guys' music taste and mine don't

474
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:50,285
Speaker 2:  align. You guys have no K-pop playlist And I need stray kids to,

475
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:54,205
Speaker 2:  to really get pumping. So Yep. Like how do you think about

476
00:33:54,205 --> 00:33:57,245
Speaker 2:  the media side of that and the content production?

477
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:01,405
Speaker 10:  Yeah, the, the music side was almost an

478
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:04,845
Speaker 10:  accidental discovery. So when we launched the app

479
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:09,365
Speaker 10:  in 2020, we had very little money. We

480
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:13,325
Speaker 10:  couldn't go invest in content that was owned, we

481
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:17,165
Speaker 10:  couldn't purchase licenses, we just didn't have any resources to think

482
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:20,885
Speaker 10:  about solving music and doing it in a way that was

483
00:34:21,115 --> 00:34:25,045
Speaker 10:  like legal and compliant with the laws of ownership. So like

484
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:27,645
Speaker 10:  we just couldn't solve that. But like from our perspective we were like,

485
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:31,405
Speaker 10:  I don't know, when you go to the gym are you listening to the

486
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:34,525
Speaker 10:  music in the background or do you have your headphones on and are you picking

487
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:38,405
Speaker 10:  it and is it a personal decision? And for us it was, it was

488
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:42,125
Speaker 10:  personal but we, we launched just having no other option

489
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:46,165
Speaker 10:  but giving the option of an integration with Spotify and Apple Music so

490
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:50,045
Speaker 10:  that it's clean to go, you know, pick your music and then integrating

491
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:53,445
Speaker 10:  the experience so that the music is ducking down when voiceovers are happening

492
00:34:53,445 --> 00:34:57,245
Speaker 10:  when the coach is talking and just making it feel like it's purposeful

493
00:34:57,245 --> 00:35:01,165
Speaker 10:  in how the two systems are talking to each other. What we learned

494
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:05,085
Speaker 10:  really quickly early on was that that was a core value prop for people.

495
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:09,405
Speaker 10:  If you go to our app store reviews and we've got

496
00:35:09,405 --> 00:35:13,325
Speaker 10:  75,000 written app store reviews, it's like a third of them will reference

497
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:17,125
Speaker 10:  playing their own music. And so it became a differentiator, one

498
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:20,805
Speaker 10:  that was like better for the business but it became a differentiator 'cause

499
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:24,685
Speaker 10:  we learned that like people actually who are consuming our content wants

500
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:28,525
Speaker 10:  to be picking their own music and using their own apps and their own

501
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:31,765
Speaker 10:  services that they're already paying for. And so like that, that has been

502
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:36,405
Speaker 10:  true from the beginning but we kind of fell backwards into

503
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:38,305
Speaker 10:  it not having a ton of other options.

504
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:42,685
Speaker 2:  We love a happy accident. And kind of along that line,

505
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:46,965
Speaker 2:  were there features that you thought would work and then

506
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:51,165
Speaker 2:  didn't and then vice versa. Were there features that

507
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:53,405
Speaker 2:  you were like this will never work and then it did

508
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:57,605
Speaker 10:  Sort of like the whole thing has been a game of like

509
00:35:57,835 --> 00:36:01,765
Speaker 10:  extreme iteration. Like we spend a lot of time

510
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:06,245
Speaker 10:  listening to our members both unprovoked feedback

511
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:09,845
Speaker 10:  that's coming in surveys, constantly surveying the team and platform level

512
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:14,085
Speaker 10:  and like listening for what people want. So when we make a big

513
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:17,805
Speaker 10:  bet on a core product feature, it's pretty

514
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:21,765
Speaker 10:  directly informed from the user building. A Ladder journal was a clear example

515
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:25,245
Speaker 10:  of that. People were tracking rep and weights outside of the app. They wanted

516
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:28,685
Speaker 10:  an integrated experience. Modifications is another great example.

517
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:32,845
Speaker 10:  People were modifying on their own but they were making up the modification

518
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:37,085
Speaker 10:  or asking in Team chat, which is basically a big group chat inside

519
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:40,885
Speaker 10:  all of these programs. Not a great experience, but people were screaming

520
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:44,605
Speaker 10:  at us for these features. And so when we hear it that loudly and we go make

521
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:48,245
Speaker 10:  a huge bet, we we're, we're extremely confident that

522
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:52,325
Speaker 10:  it's gonna be well received and we've got a beta group of 2000 members

523
00:36:52,425 --> 00:36:55,245
Speaker 10:  and we're getting feedback through this whole process and we're learning

524
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:59,165
Speaker 10:  what we got right and what we, what we got wrong. There were some features

525
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:02,925
Speaker 10:  early on that we weren't sure how important they

526
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:06,805
Speaker 10:  would be. One of those was a one-to-one chat. We had a

527
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:10,645
Speaker 10:  one-to-one chat in in the app that was just part of the, the

528
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,485
Speaker 10:  membership. And because of that we had a expensive price. So when we

529
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:18,165
Speaker 10:  launched we were 60 bucks a month. It wasn't meant to be like chat with

530
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:21,765
Speaker 10:  your coach as a buddy, more like an OnStar button where you had a very specific

531
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:24,485
Speaker 10:  thing you needed a modification, you have an injury or asking about the

532
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:28,445
Speaker 10:  programming and the coach can give you a response. And when we

533
00:37:28,445 --> 00:37:32,325
Speaker 10:  first launched the, the app, most of our users were coming from

534
00:37:32,385 --> 00:37:36,045
Speaker 10:  the audiences, the social audiences of our early coaches and they had, you

535
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,845
Speaker 10:  know, 10, 20,000 followers on Instagram. And that

536
00:37:39,845 --> 00:37:43,245
Speaker 10:  person who was following them knew that coach knew the style, had all the

537
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:46,285
Speaker 10:  context that coach was their hero. And yeah, they were really excited Bill

538
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:49,965
Speaker 10:  to talk to that coach and they valued chatty

539
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:53,405
Speaker 10:  one-to-one. When we started growing and investing in growth and growing

540
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:56,525
Speaker 10:  outside of our coach's audience, what we learned through a whole bunch of

541
00:37:56,525 --> 00:38:00,325
Speaker 10:  work was one, the price was way too expensive. Like

542
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:03,685
Speaker 10:  people were anchoring to their content subscription apps, so they're thinking

543
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:07,525
Speaker 10:  about Spotify and Netflix, right? And we were multiples of that. So the

544
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:11,485
Speaker 10:  price value equation was completely outta whack and we learned that most

545
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:14,845
Speaker 10:  people weren't willing to pay extra for this chat feature.

546
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:19,205
Speaker 10:  On the flip side of that, like the cheer, the Cheers feature that

547
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:22,965
Speaker 10:  we thought was pretty cool early, early on where you

548
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:26,765
Speaker 10:  open up the app, you're on the home screen, you can see avatars of members

549
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,405
Speaker 10:  who are in their workout with a ring that shows how far they are into the

550
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:33,805
Speaker 10:  workout and you can send them a cheer and it's just kind of a fun right

551
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:36,645
Speaker 10:  gamified experience. That feature

552
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:41,485
Speaker 10:  has become unbelievably important to retention. And we've spent a

553
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:45,325
Speaker 10:  ton of time looking at, you know, what is the minimum number of cheers per

554
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:49,245
Speaker 10:  workout that leads to longer term retention or what

555
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:52,565
Speaker 10:  is when you come into the welcome workout, your first workout of ladder,

556
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:57,005
Speaker 10:  like how many cheers like actually are impactful and we've like correlated

557
00:38:57,005 --> 00:39:00,725
Speaker 10:  this to retention. So that feature is on the home screen for

558
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:04,405
Speaker 10:  a reason. It might feel a little different when you come in there, but it's

559
00:39:04,405 --> 00:39:07,885
Speaker 10:  really, really important and really powerful and it brings, you know, kind

560
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:11,445
Speaker 10:  of the atmosphere and feeling of being on a team and doing it with other

561
00:39:11,445 --> 00:39:14,965
Speaker 10:  people who, who are like you. So certainly have had features that have

562
00:39:15,045 --> 00:39:19,005
Speaker 10:  outperformed what we would've guessed on the impact that they would drive

563
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:19,685
Speaker 10:  to our membership.

564
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:23,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's like a really good segue. It's like you're reading my mind,

565
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:26,765
Speaker 2:  but I wanted to talk about gamifying and community

566
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:30,525
Speaker 2:  because one thing I noticed is, okay, So I am

567
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:34,605
Speaker 2:  not the most social person while working out, I'm very much lone wolf

568
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:38,885
Speaker 2:  leave me alone. I tried the run clubs and I'm the type of

569
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:42,365
Speaker 2:  runner and I'm like, don't talk to me, I'm gonna go at my pace. All that

570
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:46,165
Speaker 2:  sort of stuff. So I was so surprised to see how much I was lurking

571
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:50,285
Speaker 2:  in the team chats and being like, oh, I don't participate much in them,

572
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:53,805
Speaker 2:  but I'm like, oh, here's Monday morning, here's, here's Nicole's little message,

573
00:39:53,985 --> 00:39:57,605
Speaker 2:  let me see what everyone else is saying. Oh yep. My gut feels that feels

574
00:39:57,635 --> 00:40:01,565
Speaker 2:  nice. And then to your point, the cheers sometimes, you know,

575
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:05,285
Speaker 2:  Nicole loves a plank. I do not, but I try

576
00:40:06,425 --> 00:40:10,125
Speaker 2:  and when I'm, when I'm struggling in, in the plank, sometimes someone

577
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:13,925
Speaker 2:  will send a cheer and I'm like, oh, that's nice. I can't let this random

578
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:17,245
Speaker 2:  person down, let me, let me, let me hold out an extra 10 seconds in the plank.

579
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:21,245
Speaker 2:  And I was so surprised to see how that actually impacted

580
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:25,165
Speaker 2:  me. So, you know, but that's kind of the positive side of

581
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:28,645
Speaker 2:  gamifying. There are other kind of more mixed,

582
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:32,885
Speaker 2:  I have complicated feelings about streaks for example,

583
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:37,285
Speaker 2:  and getting really mentally fixated

584
00:40:37,345 --> 00:40:40,725
Speaker 2:  and obsessive about streaks to the point where I get injured where I don't

585
00:40:40,915 --> 00:40:44,565
Speaker 2:  take the rest in. So how, how, how do you think about an

586
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:48,525
Speaker 2:  approach the gamified features so that you

587
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:52,005
Speaker 2:  keep people engaged, you, you do keep them feeling positive but you don't

588
00:40:52,245 --> 00:40:55,845
Speaker 2:  overload them and you make Yep. Their mental health worse in, in some

589
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:56,245
Speaker 2:  cases.

590
00:40:57,475 --> 00:41:01,285
Speaker 10:  Yeah, e every feature we design and So I, this is true, everything

591
00:41:01,285 --> 00:41:04,925
Speaker 10:  you've seen in the app is all aimed at helping to keep you

592
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:08,165
Speaker 10:  consistent with your workouts. So they're not just random features to be

593
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,565
Speaker 10:  there, they're there because they have some correlation to

594
00:41:11,565 --> 00:41:15,525
Speaker 10:  motivation or correlation to, to workouts streak

595
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:19,445
Speaker 10:  mapped well to our value prop of helping you stay consistent with a

596
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:23,325
Speaker 10:  plan and rewarding co consistency. But we made

597
00:41:23,325 --> 00:41:27,165
Speaker 10:  changes to shrinks based on some of the points that you just made.

598
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:31,125
Speaker 10:  When we first launched the app, our user was on the more

599
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:34,645
Speaker 10:  advanced end of strength, strength training that's changed as we've grown

600
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:38,645
Speaker 10:  and added new modalities and found fits with a broader basket

601
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:42,685
Speaker 10:  of users. But our streak was four workouts per week, which

602
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:46,605
Speaker 10:  we learned pretty quickly was not realistic for many of our

603
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:50,445
Speaker 10:  members. And so it was like this, it was having the opposite effect.

604
00:41:50,545 --> 00:41:54,085
Speaker 10:  It was not motivational, it was like, well I can't do that So I don't really

605
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:57,925
Speaker 10:  care about this and I'm constantly underperforming. And so that was a, that

606
00:41:57,925 --> 00:42:01,405
Speaker 10:  was an important insight and we, we changed the streak based on feedback

607
00:42:01,405 --> 00:42:04,205
Speaker 10:  for our members and watching what was happening and we moved it to three

608
00:42:04,545 --> 00:42:07,845
Speaker 10:  and we had a core group of people that said like, you're making this softer

609
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:11,405
Speaker 10:  and easier, but for the most part, most folks were excited about it

610
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:15,565
Speaker 10:  and, and thought that it made a ton of sense and actually was now a motivational

611
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:19,365
Speaker 10:  feature. Fast forward to last month, we launched

612
00:42:19,765 --> 00:42:23,605
Speaker 10:  Streak Freeze because we know that life gets in the way and we would get

613
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:27,685
Speaker 10:  support tickets folks saying, Hey, I got married this week, I

614
00:42:27,685 --> 00:42:31,645
Speaker 10:  had a death in my family, I had a 53 week streak

615
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:34,725
Speaker 10:  And I losses or anything you could do and we would help 'em and we would

616
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:38,325
Speaker 10:  repair the streak. Like we would, we would repair it. And Streak Freeze

617
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:42,165
Speaker 10:  was introduced to help solve some of these motivational elements or

618
00:42:42,215 --> 00:42:45,965
Speaker 10:  deter defeat when it's just not possible to, to

619
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:48,885
Speaker 10:  reach the goal from a consistency perspective.

620
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:53,125
Speaker 2:  Cool. And then, you know, just getting on the, the sense of quitting, like

621
00:42:53,345 --> 00:42:56,765
Speaker 2:  how do you get people back on the horse because I think that's a, that's

622
00:42:56,805 --> 00:43:00,485
Speaker 2:  a problem that a lot of fitness tech, wearable tech

623
00:43:00,555 --> 00:43:04,285
Speaker 2:  basically my entire beat is, is like obsessed with

624
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:08,405
Speaker 2:  is is just never getting you to quit. How do we get people to stick with

625
00:43:08,405 --> 00:43:12,365
Speaker 2:  it? Because behavioral change is really hard. Like yep, I am, I'm dedicated

626
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:16,165
Speaker 2:  to fitness and even I have like months long slumps where I'm like, Ooh, I'm

627
00:43:16,165 --> 00:43:19,525
Speaker 2:  not doing as much as I should be. So how do you get people back on the horse?

628
00:43:19,545 --> 00:43:20,845
Speaker 2:  How do you approach that challenge?

629
00:43:22,075 --> 00:43:25,885
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I, I think like making sure the experience is fun and motivated

630
00:43:25,945 --> 00:43:29,805
Speaker 10:  has been core from our, to our product from

631
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:33,445
Speaker 10:  the beginning. So whether that's your on a routine and we're trying to keep

632
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:37,365
Speaker 10:  you excited for the next workout, all of those experience and levers

633
00:43:37,465 --> 00:43:41,405
Speaker 10:  are designed to keep you going. I think one, like you have to get

634
00:43:41,475 --> 00:43:45,365
Speaker 10:  results, right? It has to prove that it's working and we need to tell

635
00:43:45,365 --> 00:43:49,045
Speaker 10:  you that it's working and that doesn't mean that the scale is changing.

636
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:53,085
Speaker 10:  It could, it could mean you feel better, it could mean that things are

637
00:43:53,085 --> 00:43:56,485
Speaker 10:  happening to your mood that are driving outcomes that are positive to your

638
00:43:56,485 --> 00:44:00,285
Speaker 10:  life. And so we use these features to reinforce

639
00:44:00,395 --> 00:44:04,125
Speaker 10:  that, hey, you just hit a pr, like that's a new accomplishment for you.

640
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:07,885
Speaker 10:  We celebrate badges, micro wins that aren't about the actual

641
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:11,685
Speaker 10:  outcome but that you did, you did something hard. All of those are motivating

642
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:15,765
Speaker 10:  and helpful I think to, to stay excited even though weekly

643
00:44:15,955 --> 00:44:19,685
Speaker 10:  drop. So our workouts are new every week, they're progressive,

644
00:44:20,145 --> 00:44:23,965
Speaker 10:  but no two workouts have ever been the same. And so even

645
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:27,685
Speaker 10:  that is really unique versus other, other apps in our

646
00:44:27,685 --> 00:44:31,290
Speaker 10:  space. We work with our coaches on programming, looking at the data every

647
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,765
Speaker 10:  single week. It's informing what's happening the next week. But that element

648
00:44:34,945 --> 00:44:38,765
Speaker 10:  of surprise and variability or what are we doing this week is a

649
00:44:38,765 --> 00:44:42,525
Speaker 10:  real motivator for folks. So we, we use that as a moment.

650
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:46,525
Speaker 10:  We call it the drop We release workouts on Sunday evening, it's the highest

651
00:44:46,525 --> 00:44:49,885
Speaker 10:  moment engagement of the week. People come into the app to see what the

652
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:53,485
Speaker 10:  workouts for the week will look like. There's anticipation and fun.

653
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:56,685
Speaker 10:  If you, again, if you look at our app store reviews, 'cause we, we always

654
00:44:56,695 --> 00:45:00,605
Speaker 10:  trust the words of our members. What they'll say is like, I'm having way

655
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:03,965
Speaker 10:  more fun than I would've expected or I'm way more motivated than I thought

656
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:07,725
Speaker 10:  I was. When people are falling off, like we have moments that

657
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:11,845
Speaker 10:  are like natural reentry points that we use to

658
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:15,005
Speaker 10:  bring you back in and the strength series is a big, a big part of that.

659
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:19,285
Speaker 10:  Maybe you fell off for reset the first strength series of the year. Well

660
00:45:19,285 --> 00:45:22,925
Speaker 10:  we have another one coming and we'll use that moment, those two weeks in

661
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:26,845
Speaker 10:  between to try to pull you back in and get you excited and say

662
00:45:26,845 --> 00:45:29,925
Speaker 10:  it's, it's now a great time to restart. Like you're not behind. We're all

663
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:33,885
Speaker 10:  starting together tomorrow and that, that is really effective. I mean if

664
00:45:33,885 --> 00:45:37,645
Speaker 10:  you look at everyone who has left our app or turned our app, almost a third

665
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:38,365
Speaker 10:  have come back,

666
00:45:38,665 --> 00:45:39,525
Speaker 2:  Oh that's pretty wild.

667
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:43,205
Speaker 10:  It's a really important motion from the company side, which is like,

668
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:46,725
Speaker 10:  hey, maybe it wasn't the right time for you, like un understand, but we're

669
00:45:46,725 --> 00:45:50,005
Speaker 10:  gonna try to bring you back in and get you completing workouts again and

670
00:45:50,005 --> 00:45:52,845
Speaker 10:  trying to help you stay consistent and getting to the goals that you're

671
00:45:52,845 --> 00:45:53,525
Speaker 10:  looking to achieve.

672
00:45:54,325 --> 00:45:57,445
Speaker 2:  I guess one thing I wanted to ask was what's next

673
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:01,645
Speaker 2:  for Ladder? Obviously you're iterating, you're thinking, do you ever feel

674
00:46:01,645 --> 00:46:04,925
Speaker 2:  like you get to a point where you're like, hey we we've we've got a pretty

675
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:08,805
Speaker 2:  cool formula or or is it just a, a case where

676
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:12,205
Speaker 2:  everyone has ideas all the time and it's fine tuning,

677
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:16,685
Speaker 10:  It never stops it it, which is a good thing. Like there

678
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:20,965
Speaker 10:  we, we have more things that we know we need to build

679
00:46:21,275 --> 00:46:24,965
Speaker 10:  than time and resources, which is a good problem that we're, that we're

680
00:46:24,965 --> 00:46:27,805
Speaker 10:  solving. There are some like big exciting

681
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:32,365
Speaker 10:  projects that are, that are jumping out at us from our members words

682
00:46:32,595 --> 00:46:35,845
Speaker 10:  like we built the Ladder journal. The Ladder journal helps you track reps

683
00:46:35,845 --> 00:46:39,245
Speaker 10:  and weights. We now have 200 million data points from our members

684
00:46:40,075 --> 00:46:43,925
Speaker 10:  that have been inserted into that journal and

685
00:46:43,945 --> 00:46:47,885
Speaker 10:  now we wanna figure out how do we take all that data and then help tell

686
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:51,765
Speaker 10:  you what to do. Not just looking backwards at what you did, but what weight

687
00:46:51,785 --> 00:46:54,365
Speaker 10:  you should pick up when you should push harder when you're getting close

688
00:46:54,365 --> 00:46:58,205
Speaker 10:  to a pr, let's use all of this information just like a coach

689
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:01,645
Speaker 10:  who would be standing with you and saying these things, reacting and watching.

690
00:47:02,015 --> 00:47:05,765
Speaker 10:  Let's use that information and help customize the experience even more.

691
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:09,685
Speaker 10:  Giving you perspective on what to do next. That's at the user level, not

692
00:47:09,685 --> 00:47:13,325
Speaker 10:  just at the, at the T-Mobile. So I think there's a lot of opportunity on

693
00:47:13,505 --> 00:47:17,405
Speaker 10:  Ladder Journal and using all this incredible information that

694
00:47:17,405 --> 00:47:21,125
Speaker 10:  we have to make the experience better and more, more personal.

695
00:47:21,635 --> 00:47:25,165
Speaker 10:  There's a lot of exciting things on community that we're excited about.

696
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:28,805
Speaker 10:  People want private tribes or small groups,

697
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:32,325
Speaker 10:  whether that's opting into a smaller group. It could be

698
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:36,565
Speaker 10:  women in New York who go to the gym. It could be

699
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:40,485
Speaker 10:  you started on a team or a program at the same time, but creating a micro

700
00:47:40,615 --> 00:47:43,805
Speaker 10:  experience that's even more relevance to the people who are in that group

701
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:47,645
Speaker 10:  with you. Not degrading team chat but additive to the

702
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:50,645
Speaker 10:  experience. So there's a whole bunch of things we're excited about on the

703
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:54,765
Speaker 10:  community side now that it's growing and there are people

704
00:47:54,765 --> 00:47:58,525
Speaker 10:  coming to the app who know of other people, their friends and there

705
00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:02,365
Speaker 10:  isn't really a great way to go find them and have a shared experience. You

706
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:06,285
Speaker 10:  can imagine, you know, a lot of our members have a text group with their

707
00:48:06,285 --> 00:48:09,125
Speaker 10:  workout buddies where they're talking about progress and they're sharing

708
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:13,125
Speaker 10:  what's going on. That stuff should be in the app, especially as you have

709
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:16,605
Speaker 10:  more and more people who are using Ladder. We should create an ability to

710
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:21,045
Speaker 10:  let you challenge your friends or cheer on your friends away

711
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:24,885
Speaker 10:  or aside from the team or agnostic to what team you are on.

712
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:28,685
Speaker 10:  So we're really excited about, about those components. And the third like

713
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:32,805
Speaker 10:  big, big chunk from our perspective that we're, we're

714
00:48:32,805 --> 00:48:36,685
Speaker 10:  on learn mode right now is on nutrition. Like our members are, are

715
00:48:36,685 --> 00:48:40,645
Speaker 10:  screaming at us to think about nutrition and think about how do you

716
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:45,125
Speaker 10:  consolidate this experience into one 'cause if, if you think about it,

717
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:49,205
Speaker 10:  it's really one consumer with one goal or one problem.

718
00:48:49,745 --> 00:48:53,285
Speaker 10:  So they're looking to lose weight or put on muscle mass.

719
00:48:53,755 --> 00:48:57,525
Speaker 10:  That goal has inputs and outputs. Outputs are

720
00:48:57,555 --> 00:49:01,325
Speaker 10:  workout or physical activity. What's coming out of your body as a

721
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:04,965
Speaker 10:  result of the workouts that you're doing and inputs is food and diet

722
00:49:05,105 --> 00:49:08,685
Speaker 10:  and nutrition. And those two things have to work together

723
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:11,645
Speaker 10:  to get to the outcome that you are solving for.

724
00:49:12,555 --> 00:49:16,365
Speaker 2:  Cool. And you know, So I gotta ask, you know I'm a wearables reviewer,

725
00:49:16,925 --> 00:49:20,885
Speaker 2:  I test a lot of this stuff. Everybody's adding in a ton of

726
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:24,525
Speaker 2:  ai, AI summaries. Yep. AI

727
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:27,405
Speaker 2:  chatbot coaches. What's your take on that?

728
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:32,085
Speaker 10:  AI in general has been central to our team and how we work for

729
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:36,165
Speaker 10:  a long time. Like we have 20 x this business

730
00:49:36,235 --> 00:49:40,125
Speaker 10:  over the last couple of years and our team is roughly the

731
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:43,925
Speaker 10:  same size. So we're 40 people including all of our coaches

732
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,925
Speaker 10:  who are full-time teammates with us. So it's a very small team for the work

733
00:49:47,925 --> 00:49:51,605
Speaker 10:  that we're doing. And the, the reason is we've, we've used AI to

734
00:49:51,705 --> 00:49:55,525
Speaker 10:  10 x every individual and so we, we don't have many people or

735
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,405
Speaker 10:  any who are managing folks as a job, but

736
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:03,205
Speaker 10:  they're using AI to amplify the work that they're doing. We use

737
00:50:03,265 --> 00:50:06,925
Speaker 10:  AI a lot with our coaches in a variety of ways

738
00:50:07,035 --> 00:50:10,485
Speaker 10:  like Team Chat, some of our teams have a hundred thousand people in 'em

739
00:50:10,945 --> 00:50:14,925
Speaker 10:  and it's not a good use of time for the coach to read thousands of

740
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:18,765
Speaker 10:  messages to understand what's happening in team chat, what's the temperament,

741
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,965
Speaker 10:  what questions are people asking, where are people getting stuck? And so

742
00:50:21,965 --> 00:50:25,245
Speaker 10:  we've created tools on the backend that let them very quickly

743
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:29,445
Speaker 10:  ingest all the content from the day, understand the mood and the temperament,

744
00:50:29,845 --> 00:50:33,525
Speaker 10:  identify top questions members who have questions that have never been

745
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:37,405
Speaker 10:  responded to and we help the coach prioritize what

746
00:50:37,405 --> 00:50:40,925
Speaker 10:  to say and when using tools like that. So it's very much

747
00:50:40,925 --> 00:50:44,845
Speaker 10:  integrated from a workflow perspective. I think over

748
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:48,725
Speaker 10:  the next, you know, year or so, you'll start to see

749
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:52,565
Speaker 10:  it driving more personalization in the experience itself.

750
00:50:52,905 --> 00:50:56,885
Speaker 10:  The latter journal for example, that will all be powered by ai which is

751
00:50:56,885 --> 00:51:00,485
Speaker 10:  we have all this information, how do we help use it to tell you or help

752
00:51:00,485 --> 00:51:04,365
Speaker 10:  you know what to do next if we enter nutrition will be

753
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:08,205
Speaker 10:  a very similar approach and you can imagine long term like we had

754
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:11,685
Speaker 10:  that coach chat that one-to-one I talked about in the beginning. There's

755
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:15,285
Speaker 10:  probably an opportunity to have a companion in the app that knows

756
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:18,645
Speaker 10:  everything from a fitness and food perspective and is able to

757
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:23,085
Speaker 10:  interact with you and on a one-to-one basis to help you get closer

758
00:51:23,305 --> 00:51:27,125
Speaker 10:  to to your goal. So I would say chapter one for us is, is

759
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:30,885
Speaker 10:  workflow and using these tools to deliver a better experience with the team

760
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:34,765
Speaker 10:  that we have. And chapter two will be using it to improve the

761
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:38,565
Speaker 10:  experience but personalize, not degrading the team atmosphere but using

762
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:42,565
Speaker 10:  all of this data and information to help give it back to you in a way

763
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:46,125
Speaker 10:  that's consumable and helps navigate you know, what the next thing should

764
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,925
Speaker 10:  be that you're, you're solving for.

765
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:51,925
Speaker 2:  Very cool. Thank you so much for taking the time to chat.

766
00:51:52,505 --> 00:51:55,005
Speaker 10:  Of course. Thanks for having me. It was a lot of fun. I appreciate it. Yeah.

767
00:51:56,035 --> 00:51:59,445
Speaker 2:  Alright, so we're gonna take a quick break and then After that we've got

768
00:51:59,525 --> 00:52:01,405
Speaker 2:  a question from The Vergecast hotline.

769
00:54:40,545 --> 00:54:44,325
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the hotline as always. The number is

770
00:54:44,325 --> 00:54:48,245
Speaker 2:  8 6 6 VERGE one one and the email is vergecast at

771
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:52,205
Speaker 2:  The Verge dot com. Very, very, very easy email. Anyway, we

772
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,405
Speaker 2:  love all your questions and we try to answer at least one on the show every

773
00:54:55,475 --> 00:54:59,165
Speaker 2:  week. And this week we have an email about

774
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:03,205
Speaker 2:  AI Fitness insights, which this is a follow-up conversation

775
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:07,325
Speaker 2:  to one that David And I had before he abandoned us for, you know,

776
00:55:07,615 --> 00:55:10,925
Speaker 2:  fatherhood. Again, the rudeness.

777
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:15,045
Speaker 2:  Anyway, the email is from Kevin from San Diego and it says,

778
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:19,965
Speaker 2:  I have two questions slash prompts related to your recent discussion of Apple

779
00:55:19,995 --> 00:55:23,925
Speaker 2:  Fitness Buddy, or whatever it is called, and other AI and fitness

780
00:55:24,035 --> 00:55:28,005
Speaker 2:  tracker offerings. For background, I'm a very happy whoop user. Ooh, I got

781
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:31,405
Speaker 2:  the whoop on right now. It's my favorite wearable I've ever used.

782
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:35,285
Speaker 2:  Having said that, I don't find their AI coach useful and agree with David

783
00:55:35,345 --> 00:55:38,605
Speaker 2:  and V's. Takes my questions. Are the optimistic,

784
00:55:39,075 --> 00:55:42,765
Speaker 2:  does some set of users out there enjoy these and why? What

785
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:46,605
Speaker 2:  prompts are they putting in and what are we missing out on? And the

786
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:50,725
Speaker 2:  cynical, do the companies themselves whoop or a Garmin Apple even

787
00:55:50,905 --> 00:55:54,765
Speaker 2:  see these are good? Or if you gave them the truth serum, would

788
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:58,645
Speaker 2:  they just admit that they suck and they just have to offer one because everyone

789
00:55:58,645 --> 00:56:02,365
Speaker 2:  else does? Ooh, ooh goodness.

790
00:56:02,575 --> 00:56:06,165
Speaker 2:  Kevin from San Diego, very spicy, a very spicy email.

791
00:56:06,865 --> 00:56:10,645
Speaker 2:  And it's a really well timed email because I actually just wrote up

792
00:56:11,245 --> 00:56:15,205
Speaker 2:  a story on The Verge called the Unbearable Obviousness of AI Fitness

793
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:19,405
Speaker 2:  Insights call back to my, one of my favorite books, the Unbearable

794
00:56:19,405 --> 00:56:23,400
Speaker 2:  Lightness of Being. And you know what? Let's take the optimistic

795
00:56:23,605 --> 00:56:27,565
Speaker 2:  question and the cynical question because do some set of users

796
00:56:27,745 --> 00:56:31,325
Speaker 2:  out there enjoy these and why? So when I was doing

797
00:56:31,645 --> 00:56:35,445
Speaker 2:  research for that story, I actually reached out to Aura, I reached

798
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:39,205
Speaker 2:  out to Strava And I reached out to B to

799
00:56:39,425 --> 00:56:43,085
Speaker 2:  say like, you know, what's the feedback that you've gotten from

800
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:46,165
Speaker 2:  people using this? Because I personally,

801
00:56:47,685 --> 00:56:51,445
Speaker 2:  I like to go on the subreddits for these companies and read

802
00:56:52,185 --> 00:56:55,725
Speaker 2:  the, the, the discourse. Anytime I get a really

803
00:56:55,905 --> 00:56:58,005
Speaker 2:  stupid AI fitness summary.

804
00:56:59,545 --> 00:57:03,445
Speaker 2:  And you know, as you can imagine, what the companies told me was

805
00:57:03,445 --> 00:57:07,365
Speaker 2:  that, yeah, people actually really like it. But the numbers that

806
00:57:07,365 --> 00:57:10,325
Speaker 2:  they gave me, and it's, it's in the article, which we'll put in the show

807
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:14,245
Speaker 2:  notes, they were kind of, let's just say there was some words that were

808
00:57:14,245 --> 00:57:18,205
Speaker 2:  doing heavy lifting. I think, you know, they were like, they

809
00:57:18,285 --> 00:57:22,085
Speaker 2:  use them weekly. Okay. Like of

810
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:25,965
Speaker 2:  the weekly users who decided to give feedback, well, you know,

811
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:29,525
Speaker 2:  the decided to give feedback is doing a lot of heavy lifting there.

812
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:34,365
Speaker 2:  But I do think that if you have people who are enjoying

813
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:37,965
Speaker 2:  these very milk toast summaries, they are gonna be the

814
00:57:38,085 --> 00:57:41,885
Speaker 2:  beginners. They're gonna be people who are very new to fitness, who don't

815
00:57:41,885 --> 00:57:45,685
Speaker 2:  necessarily have the foundational knowledge of like, what makes

816
00:57:45,805 --> 00:57:49,445
Speaker 2:  a good habit? What are good nutritional things to think about?

817
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:53,525
Speaker 2:  How does rest interplay with your diet and nutrition? So

818
00:57:53,545 --> 00:57:57,325
Speaker 2:  for those people, they might bring insights that are,

819
00:57:57,585 --> 00:58:01,125
Speaker 2:  you know, not really insights, but they're there in the app and they're convenient

820
00:58:01,505 --> 00:58:04,885
Speaker 2:  and easily summarized. So maybe

821
00:58:05,825 --> 00:58:09,005
Speaker 2:  as for what prompts they're putting in, well that depends. 'cause there's

822
00:58:09,005 --> 00:58:12,485
Speaker 2:  two types of AI fitness features, and one of them are these just very

823
00:58:12,795 --> 00:58:16,645
Speaker 2:  blanket regurgitated AI summaries. There's no prompts being put into those,

824
00:58:17,345 --> 00:58:21,285
Speaker 2:  but some like Aura and whoop actually have chat bots that you can

825
00:58:21,685 --> 00:58:25,645
Speaker 2:  somewhat interact with. There's generally little prompts that they like

826
00:58:25,645 --> 00:58:27,245
Speaker 2:  pre-filled out prompts that you can do.

827
00:58:28,925 --> 00:58:32,605
Speaker 2:  I don't necessarily think we're missing out. I found that you can

828
00:58:32,985 --> 00:58:36,885
Speaker 2:  get a decent response if you spend a lot of time

829
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:40,805
Speaker 2:  talking to this chat bott. It's like you got, I had to train the oral chat

830
00:58:40,825 --> 00:58:44,165
Speaker 2:  bot quite a bit by like kind of taking its

831
00:58:44,165 --> 00:58:47,485
Speaker 2:  non-existent AI hand and going like, okay, I've had a very stressful week.

832
00:58:47,765 --> 00:58:51,565
Speaker 2:  I think my glucose is up because I'm really stressed out. Is that a

833
00:58:51,685 --> 00:58:55,125
Speaker 2:  factor that affects glucose Also, I got injured also. I did this also. I

834
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:58,725
Speaker 2:  did that. And then the answers that it gives to me are a little more tailored

835
00:58:58,825 --> 00:59:02,725
Speaker 2:  to that specific situation, but it's still stuff that I could

836
00:59:02,725 --> 00:59:06,325
Speaker 2:  have found on Google and or through common sense in that

837
00:59:06,355 --> 00:59:10,205
Speaker 2:  respect. I think the people who do enjoy them

838
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:14,045
Speaker 2:  again, are those who just don't, they're coming into this fitness

839
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:17,755
Speaker 2:  journey completely new, completely fresh. They don't

840
00:59:17,785 --> 00:59:21,485
Speaker 2:  have the basic know-how that you might have as,

841
00:59:21,585 --> 00:59:25,285
Speaker 2:  as someone who is a extensive whoop user. 'cause

842
00:59:25,335 --> 00:59:29,285
Speaker 2:  let's be real, the whoop user set, they're generally very experienced

843
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:33,365
Speaker 2:  athletes or they're very comfortable with these concepts of rest

844
00:59:33,585 --> 00:59:37,525
Speaker 2:  and recovery and how that plays into fitness where you play up

845
00:59:37,585 --> 00:59:41,565
Speaker 2:  or play down the, the intensity based on the amount of

846
00:59:41,565 --> 00:59:45,125
Speaker 2:  strain you've taken on. And so let's get to the cynical part of

847
00:59:45,155 --> 00:59:49,045
Speaker 2:  Kevin's question where it says, do the companies themselves even see these

848
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:53,125
Speaker 2:  are good? Or if we gave them a truth serum, would they admit they suck?

849
00:59:53,635 --> 00:59:57,605
Speaker 2:  Well, I've made it my personal mission to ask the CEOs of

850
00:59:57,605 --> 01:00:01,405
Speaker 2:  all these companies when I interview them, you know, let's

851
01:00:01,405 --> 01:00:05,245
Speaker 2:  be real here. And the media training absolutely kicks on,

852
01:00:05,425 --> 01:00:08,965
Speaker 2:  and they, I don't blame them at all for that. They, they absolutely have

853
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:12,925
Speaker 2:  to kind of sell this because let's be real, they do have to offer

854
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:16,885
Speaker 2:  this because this is what investors wanna see from them at

855
01:00:16,885 --> 01:00:20,605
Speaker 2:  this point in time with the AI zeitgeist. But, but,

856
01:00:20,705 --> 01:00:23,885
Speaker 2:  but, but, but I'm gonna give them a little credit because

857
01:00:25,105 --> 01:00:28,965
Speaker 2:  the problem with AI fitness and with wearables at

858
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:32,205
Speaker 2:  large is that you are generating a huge amount of data. I've been testing

859
01:00:32,315 --> 01:00:34,045
Speaker 2:  this, this particular

860
01:00:35,685 --> 01:00:39,365
Speaker 2:  category or beat for close to a decade now. I have close to a

861
01:00:39,365 --> 01:00:43,165
Speaker 2:  decade's worth of personal data amassed across

862
01:00:44,235 --> 01:00:47,725
Speaker 2:  several different platforms. And I'm pretty

863
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:51,765
Speaker 2:  adept at looking at it, understanding my baseline and pulling out insights

864
01:00:51,765 --> 01:00:55,365
Speaker 2:  naturally. But even I need help from time to time to

865
01:00:55,365 --> 01:00:59,285
Speaker 2:  contextualize what it is that I'm seeing. And I can't crunch

866
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:02,765
Speaker 2:  those numbers all by myself. So theoretically,

867
01:01:03,265 --> 01:01:07,165
Speaker 2:  if we could have an AI that was saying something along the

868
01:01:07,165 --> 01:01:11,125
Speaker 2:  lines of, you know, I'm gonna use my personal life, for example, I ate

869
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,005
Speaker 2:  it recently while on a run, I just completely,

870
01:01:15,365 --> 01:01:19,045
Speaker 2:  I was overly optimistic about what my body could handle after taking a break

871
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:22,925
Speaker 2:  because I had a crazy last two months. So I'm

872
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:26,405
Speaker 2:  coming off of a prolonged training break where I was mostly doing maintenance,

873
01:01:26,405 --> 01:01:30,165
Speaker 2:  And I was like, yeah, you know, it's, it's hot outside And I'm gonna do my

874
01:01:30,405 --> 01:01:34,205
Speaker 2:  heat acclimation training with a 3.25 mile run because that

875
01:01:34,225 --> 01:01:38,205
Speaker 2:  is so easy for me. It's so easy for me when I am at, at

876
01:01:38,325 --> 01:01:41,805
Speaker 2:  i on the top of my game, I can do a 3.25 mile run in my sleep

877
01:01:42,385 --> 01:01:46,205
Speaker 2:  in the history of my running history. But in the last two months,

878
01:01:46,945 --> 01:01:50,885
Speaker 2:  you know, 3.25 is actually a bit more when you're putting it in the

879
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:54,365
Speaker 2:  context that it was 88 degrees And I hadn't done

880
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:58,685
Speaker 2:  a proper heat acclimatizing training regimen for two weeks. It takes

881
01:01:58,685 --> 01:02:01,885
Speaker 2:  about two weeks for your body to get used to the new heat and humidity when

882
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:05,605
Speaker 2:  you switch seasons. So I ate it. I absolutely ate it. And that's

883
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:09,125
Speaker 2:  despite the fact that I had all the hydration that I needed with me, that

884
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:13,165
Speaker 2:  I was prepped And I went at an early time of day. I completely ate it.

885
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:15,805
Speaker 2:  I have, you could see this bandage that I have on my hand.

886
01:02:17,705 --> 01:02:21,485
Speaker 2:  And what I would've wanted from these AI to be like, Hey,

887
01:02:21,485 --> 01:02:25,285
Speaker 2:  girl, you had real bad sleep the last two months and

888
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:29,005
Speaker 2:  your training was extremely reduced. You've probably lost some fitness.

889
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:33,285
Speaker 2:  And given the 10 years of history we have on you, you tend

890
01:02:33,285 --> 01:02:36,885
Speaker 2:  to come back from prolonged breaks, way too ambitious and have a

891
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:40,765
Speaker 2:  ton of self-reported injuries from doing all that. See, I know that because

892
01:02:41,085 --> 01:02:44,885
Speaker 2:  I can sit back and reflect on my patterns and where I went wrong, the AI

893
01:02:44,905 --> 01:02:48,165
Speaker 2:  was just like, wow, you had a real intense run. Good job.

894
01:02:48,705 --> 01:02:51,965
Speaker 2:  And that was across multiple platforms. And I was like, okay, so you not

895
01:02:51,965 --> 01:02:55,085
Speaker 2:  only could not synthesize the insight that I wanted

896
01:02:55,955 --> 01:02:59,925
Speaker 2:  from my years of data, you just basically gave me a book

897
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:03,645
Speaker 2:  report that was the equivalent of a fourth grader

898
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:07,525
Speaker 2:  who decided not to do the assignment and read the summary on Wikipedia, and

899
01:03:07,525 --> 01:03:11,365
Speaker 2:  it reads like that. You know? So I think

900
01:03:11,365 --> 01:03:15,245
Speaker 2:  that's kind of the state of where AI fitness summaries are

901
01:03:15,385 --> 01:03:19,245
Speaker 2:  at. They're there because they are trying to solve a

902
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:23,125
Speaker 2:  very real problem, which is data without context doesn't mean much, but

903
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:26,725
Speaker 2:  they're not as good as you are. Once you've learned your own context

904
01:03:26,945 --> 01:03:29,405
Speaker 2:  and your own patterns and reflected on all of that,

905
01:03:30,715 --> 01:03:34,485
Speaker 2:  they're not as good as you are at knowing yourself. So

906
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:38,205
Speaker 2:  that's just where we're at now. They're gonna pursue it. I keep, you know,

907
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:41,845
Speaker 2:  looking at 'em going, eh, eh, raising my eyebrow. And they keep going,

908
01:03:41,915 --> 01:03:45,805
Speaker 2:  like their eyes are frozen and they, I know they're being held

909
01:03:45,805 --> 01:03:48,885
Speaker 2:  captive by their capitalist investors, And I understand it's the little dance

910
01:03:48,885 --> 01:03:52,285
Speaker 2:  that we do, but there is a time and place for them

911
01:03:53,105 --> 01:03:56,445
Speaker 2:  if you're a textual learner And maybe the charts that are right there

912
01:03:56,835 --> 01:04:00,325
Speaker 2:  with the same exact information, but for some reason you see it

913
01:04:00,485 --> 01:04:04,045
Speaker 2:  regurgitated in a little sentence, maybe that's more digestive for you. I'm

914
01:04:04,045 --> 01:04:07,365
Speaker 2:  not saying that there's absolutely no purpose for it, but for the vast majority

915
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:11,325
Speaker 2:  of people looking for these features, wanting to have those

916
01:04:11,645 --> 01:04:15,045
Speaker 2:  insights, we're just not there yet. We just aren't. So yeah,

917
01:04:15,305 --> 01:04:19,045
Speaker 2:  that's it. Thanks for your question, Kevin. It was a really good one. I got

918
01:04:19,045 --> 01:04:22,525
