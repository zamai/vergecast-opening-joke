Description: David Pierce and Richard Lawler are joined by The Verge's Ash Parrish and Andrew Webster to talk about the Nintendo Switch 2 launch — all the things we know, and all the things we don't. (There's a lot of both.) Then The Verge's Adi Robertson joins to talk about the latest machinations in the potential TikTok ban, plus a Supreme Court hearing about adult content that might just be about the future of the internet. Finally, in the lightning round, David and Richard talk about Patrick Spence leaving Sonos, the Blue Origin launch, Drake's latest beef with Kendrick Lamar, and more.

00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:41,405
Speaker 6:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of additional

3
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:45,365
Speaker 6:  USB ports. I'm your friend David Pierce. Neil a Patel is doing some fancy

4
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,365
Speaker 6:  journalism thing today that I don't totally understand so he's not here.

5
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:50,085
Speaker 6:  Richard Lawler is here. Hi Richard.

6
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:51,445
Speaker 7:  Hey, how you doing?

7
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:55,445
Speaker 6:  We do not do fancy journalism things here. That's NE's job.

8
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,365
Speaker 6:  We're just here to talk about Nintendo. Ash Parrish is here. Hi Ash.

9
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,485
Speaker 6:  Hi. And Andrew Webster is here. Hi Andrew. Hello

10
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:06,605
Speaker 6:  Andrew. True or false, the last time you were on camera was the last time

11
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:07,645
Speaker 6:  there was a Nintendo Switch.

12
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:10,835
Speaker 7:  That is correct. 2017 in New York.

13
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:12,235
Speaker 6:  How does it feel to be back?

14
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:13,355
Speaker 7:  I'm here,

15
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,355
Speaker 6:  I'll take it. So there's a lot of stuff to talk about today.

16
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:23,035
Speaker 6:  The TikTok ban either is or is not going to happen and literally

17
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:25,595
Speaker 6:  no one knows and everybody changes their mind every five minutes. There's

18
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:29,395
Speaker 6:  a bunch of Sonos news, a whole bunch of policy and politics stuff

19
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:32,635
Speaker 6:  happening. As the Biden administration comes to a close and the Trump administration

20
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:36,755
Speaker 6:  comes to a start. But we have to start with The Nintendo Switch, which

21
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:40,915
Speaker 6:  after, I don't know months, Andrew of you

22
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:43,915
Speaker 6:  sort of waking up every morning wondering if the today was going to be the

23
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:47,155
Speaker 6:  day that The Switch too came out finally exists

24
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,755
Speaker 6:  ish. Kind of Andrew, just explain what we know

25
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:54,515
Speaker 6:  and learned about The Switch today.

26
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:58,595
Speaker 7:  I mean pretty much what you said it exists. We have a three minute video

27
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,125
Speaker 7:  that shows shows it's a real thing and a press release that tells us

28
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:05,965
Speaker 7:  that it's a real thing but we know nothing else. It's bigger.

29
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:10,245
Speaker 7:  They won't say what size the screen is. The Joy Con are

30
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:13,925
Speaker 7:  slightly different. How, I don't know, they attach differently.

31
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:16,045
Speaker 7:  That's pretty much it. It is

32
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:19,845
Speaker 6:  Like The Switch too in every way that If you had sat down and been like,

33
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:23,485
Speaker 6:  what might The Switch to be? You would've come up with basically this, right?

34
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:27,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's like that old allergy clip where he is like, I, I always

35
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:30,245
Speaker 7:  thought they should make a PlayStation but better. And then they came up

36
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:33,485
Speaker 7:  with the PlayStation too. It's, it's that, but Nintendo did it.

37
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:37,165
Speaker 6:  Ash, Andrew and I have been talking forever about how this is like roughly

38
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,805
Speaker 6:  what we wanted out of The Switch. Is this what you wanted out of The Switch?

39
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:44,685
Speaker 8:  I don't want anything out of them. I just accept what they give

40
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:47,685
Speaker 8:  me because there's no way to anticipate and there's definitely no way to

41
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,485
Speaker 8:  demand of them. So like I'm, I'm pleased. This is exactly

42
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,245
Speaker 8:  what I expect because I had no expectations patients,

43
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:59,085
Speaker 8:  but we, we can say at least one potential thing is that there's a new

44
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:03,005
Speaker 8:  Mario Kar. True. We did get a brief glimpse

45
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:07,085
Speaker 8:  of what looks to be a new Mario Kar. It looks like it might support more

46
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:10,845
Speaker 8:  racers than normal, which might hint at some

47
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:14,485
Speaker 8:  increased multiplayer capacity. So that's cool.

48
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:18,125
Speaker 8:  But it's all, you know, caveated heavily with might and could.

49
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:22,665
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And that's actually like a bigger deal than it sounds 'cause like there

50
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:26,225
Speaker 7:  hasn't been a Mario, a New Mario Kart since the Weu technically, even though

51
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,985
Speaker 7:  Mario karts The Switch is bestselling game, it's just, it's a port. So they

52
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:32,545
Speaker 7:  haven't like done a brand new one in a very long time.

53
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:36,545
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So can I just run down the list of the things that I I that we,

54
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:39,465
Speaker 6:  we think we learned from this trailer and you guys tell me what I missed.

55
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:43,025
Speaker 6:  So like you said, bigger screen, smaller bezels

56
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:47,665
Speaker 6:  joy cons are black and bigger

57
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:52,675
Speaker 6:  and some of the, the, the triggers are bigger. There's a new button somewhere

58
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:56,515
Speaker 6:  on the thing. There's also a new port on the top next to the headphone jack.

59
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:57,555
Speaker 6:  Yes. Is that

60
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:57,915
Speaker 8:  It? Yes,

61
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:58,635
Speaker 6:  That might be.

62
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:01,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah that sounds correct.

63
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:03,525
Speaker 6:  And then some like little tiny design tweaks.

64
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:04,425
Speaker 8:  Yeah,

65
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:06,145
Speaker 7:  Yeah. The kickstand looks a little different.

66
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:10,425
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah, the kickstand. I will say the fact that there is like a good kickstand

67
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:15,915
Speaker 6:  or seemingly better kickstand that does more than one thing seems

68
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,755
Speaker 6:  very exciting. The kickstand on my switch is trash and does not

69
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:22,475
Speaker 6:  hold it at a usable angle and makes me angry every single time.

70
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:26,395
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Honestly the OLED version is like good for its screen but the

71
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:30,595
Speaker 7:  the improved kickstand makes it like the best version

72
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,155
Speaker 7:  of The Switch. Yeah. For that reason.

73
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:36,075
Speaker 6:  So I, is there anything else? Is that, did I miss anything on the list of

74
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,995
Speaker 6:  like things we actually learned from this trailer?

75
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,135
Speaker 8:  I'm trying to go over the video trailer in my head to Sure. Did make seem

76
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:43,455
Speaker 8:  connect

77
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:44,535
Speaker 7:  Just slightly differently.

78
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:49,055
Speaker 8:  Yeah, so they don't slide down anymore. They kind of like slot

79
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:52,775
Speaker 8:  in and there's like a little port or ping

80
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,815
Speaker 8:  protrusion that they kind of hook into.

81
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:57,445
Speaker 8:  Oh, also, also there's

82
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:00,525
Speaker 6:  Also some people online being worried about that, that that might be like

83
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:01,965
Speaker 6:  a thing that can break.

84
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:06,125
Speaker 8:  I mean there, there's that concern but from what it looks like it doesn't

85
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:10,005
Speaker 8:  look like it sticks out far enough to be breakable unless you like

86
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:13,845
Speaker 8:  really wanna get your fingers in there and break it deliberately. Oh, another

87
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:17,605
Speaker 8:  thing that you did potentially miss is that the, the, the joy cons might

88
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:21,485
Speaker 8:  have like some kind of cool mouse functionality because in the video we saw

89
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:24,845
Speaker 8:  them like snap to their little covers and then like zoom around like it was

90
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,805
Speaker 8:  a mouse. So that might be also something new to expect.

91
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:29,045
Speaker 8:  I

92
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:32,085
Speaker 6:  Saw people saying that and I, I went back through the video and I was like,

93
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:34,845
Speaker 6:  what in the holy hell is everybody talking about? I cannot see where this

94
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:37,245
Speaker 6:  thing is acting like a mouse. But there's that moment where it's like they're,

95
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:40,885
Speaker 6:  they're sort of on their edge like scooting around the table. Is that what

96
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:41,685
Speaker 6:  you're talking about? Yeah.

97
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:44,885
Speaker 8:  And it like at first glance it might look like oh this is just like a cool

98
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:48,725
Speaker 8:  affectation to show off the controllers but it actually might belie something

99
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:49,845
Speaker 8:  functional.

100
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:53,605
Speaker 7:  Yeah and that's because there was like leaks before saying it's gonna have

101
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:57,005
Speaker 7:  mouse stuff. I think if we didn't have those, no one would put that together.

102
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:57,885
Speaker 7:  What would skating

103
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,925
Speaker 6:  Around that be four though? Like are we playing, do we want like a pointer

104
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:02,245
Speaker 6:  on The Switch?

105
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:07,645
Speaker 8:  So I heard from people who are discussing this that it could potentially

106
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,765
Speaker 8:  lead to like things where we could see more three Ds

107
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,445
Speaker 8:  games on The Switch and that's how it interacts somehow. Maybe

108
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:19,225
Speaker 8:  possibly not sure. But that's an idea that people are spitballing.

109
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:22,905
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And you also think of all the PC games that are like portable now because

110
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:26,185
Speaker 7:  of the steam deck and it makes a lot of sense and you know,

111
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:30,525
Speaker 7:  it's been a long time since there's been a new Mario paint so. Hmm.

112
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:36,685
Speaker 6:  I I mean I do wonder how many of those things are now

113
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:40,245
Speaker 6:  sort of due for a rev because I, I went back and I watched the original

114
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:44,705
Speaker 6:  trailer to the first switch from 2017, which is like vibes

115
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:48,385
Speaker 6:  wise the complete opposite of Yeah the one that we got today.

116
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:52,465
Speaker 6:  Like that one is pure lifestyle video, right? It's like it's all

117
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:55,585
Speaker 6:  like people running around hanging out with each other and like there's a

118
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,985
Speaker 6:  party on a rooftop and then a bunch of people who are like playing multiplayer

119
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:02,785
Speaker 6:  games and they're like diagramming like a soccer plays or something

120
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:06,705
Speaker 6:  that had for reasons. But they were like trying to get you to understand

121
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:09,705
Speaker 6:  like here is what this thing is for and all the different ways you can use

122
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:13,145
Speaker 6:  it on an airplane and all this stuff. This one was just pure like we took

123
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:16,095
Speaker 6:  the thing and we changed the size and shape of it the end,

124
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:20,775
Speaker 6:  which is probably true but it does make me think like, okay, if

125
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:24,655
Speaker 6:  you're not going to blow people's mind with some like new idea about

126
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:28,615
Speaker 6:  hardware, maybe, maybe the games push is gonna have to be

127
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,575
Speaker 6:  bigger. That they're gonna have to reinvent some of that stuff for this in

128
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:36,455
Speaker 6:  order to make this feel as exciting as a new console Rev might be. Does

129
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:40,095
Speaker 9:  It have to be They sell a million of billion switches anyway. Yeah.

130
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:41,095
Speaker 9:  With no changes.

131
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:46,095
Speaker 8:  It's true. And they didn do anything with like there was no Switch Pro

132
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:50,495
Speaker 8:  we got an ole which was just like a bigger brighter screen, but we did

133
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:54,055
Speaker 8:  like, we didn't have any like real console refreshes for The Switch and it

134
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:57,885
Speaker 8:  still sold like gangbusters. There's no need to reinvent the wheel with this.

135
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:58,765
Speaker 8:  Nintendo knows that.

136
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah, this video is just like we won, like we figured it out.

137
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:04,405
Speaker 7:  Like what else is there to do?

138
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:10,415
Speaker 7:  And like even, even, I don't know, I'd be surprised if when they do the the

139
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,935
Speaker 7:  game reveal stuff, there's a lot of stuff that's like exclusive exclusive

140
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:17,815
Speaker 7:  'cause they still have like 150 million switches out there and people wanted

141
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:21,375
Speaker 7:  to buy games for it. So I think there's gonna be like, in the same way that

142
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:25,335
Speaker 7:  like with the PS five and Xbox series, whatever, it's been like

143
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:29,015
Speaker 7:  a long transition period to getting games that only play on there. I think

144
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:30,535
Speaker 7:  it's gonna be similar to The Switch too.

145
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:35,215
Speaker 6:  Okay. And speaking of that, we, there was some slightly vague

146
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:39,175
Speaker 6:  information about how games are gonna work on this thing, right?

147
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:42,295
Speaker 6:  Because the, the last bit of news we got, if I'm remembering this correctly,

148
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:45,695
Speaker 6:  was on election night in the United States when they just dropped this thing

149
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:49,655
Speaker 6:  about games being backward compatible. But then it sounds like the, the

150
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:52,855
Speaker 6:  trailer puts a little bit of an asterisk on

151
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:56,135
Speaker 8:  That. Yeah, they said some, they will be able to play

152
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:00,895
Speaker 8:  physical and digital copies of games from the original switch, but not

153
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:04,615
Speaker 8:  everything would transfer over and they did haven't given us an idea

154
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:08,375
Speaker 8:  of what games won't. But we can imagine at least some

155
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:12,415
Speaker 8:  things like the Nintendo Labo stuff, like that's not gonna be

156
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:12,855
Speaker 8:  compatible.

157
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:18,215
Speaker 8:  I can't think of anything else. But that one's the fur foremost in my mind.

158
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:22,095
Speaker 8:  Like those really, really, really weird gimmicky Nintendo Switch games

159
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:23,375
Speaker 8:  probably won't pour over.

160
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:27,015
Speaker 6:  Right. But I will say the, the thing that made me worried and maybe I'm worrying

161
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:30,255
Speaker 6:  about this for no reason, is that what that might mean is that

162
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:34,615
Speaker 6:  anybody who makes a switch game has to do something in order to support

163
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:38,615
Speaker 6:  The Switch too. That there is some like, I don't know what, like when

164
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:42,055
Speaker 6:  Apple introduces a new screen size, you have to like go in and it's not a

165
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:45,455
Speaker 6:  ton of work, but it is some work to like make it work on the new thing that

166
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:49,375
Speaker 6:  maybe it was gonna be like that and not just sort of pure

167
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,855
Speaker 6:  outta the box backward compatibility.

168
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:54,415
Speaker 7:  I think it's entirely the controllers is my guess. Mm. Like

169
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:59,055
Speaker 7:  Labo only is designed specifically for those tinier versions of the

170
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,735
Speaker 7:  JoyCon to fit in. So there's no way to make it work with the bigger one.

171
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,575
Speaker 7:  I think like

172
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:08,015
Speaker 7:  Ring Fit Adventure might be a similar one 'cause it has an accessory that

173
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:11,335
Speaker 7:  like it fits snugly in there. You can't put a bigger one in there. I think

174
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:14,095
Speaker 7:  it's just those weird oddball ones. I mean we'll, we'll like, we'll find

175
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:18,055
Speaker 7:  out soon, but there's always, I think with every Nin hano platform there's

176
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:21,935
Speaker 7:  always like one or two of those. Like we made something weird and now

177
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:25,895
Speaker 7:  it doesn't work. But the backwards compatibility thing, I think

178
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:26,695
Speaker 7:  it'll be those ones

179
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:30,855
Speaker 6:  Which I think is fine. Like I, I don't know that Labo backwards compatibility

180
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,335
Speaker 6:  is like a thing I'm super concerned about for the next version of The Switch.

181
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:38,615
Speaker 7:  I mean maybe the better screen will make Zelda and VR slightly Lewis

182
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,495
Speaker 7:  nauseous, who knows,

183
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:45,415
Speaker 6:  Counts for something I suppose. Yeah. So the only game we saw at all

184
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:49,895
Speaker 6:  was this potentially new Mario Kart. We'll see what that turns out to be.

185
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:54,965
Speaker 6:  Did it surprise any of you guys that we didn't see more games? I sort of

186
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:55,965
Speaker 6:  assumed we'd see more games.

187
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:59,885
Speaker 8:  I mean we didn't see any games hardly for the first one. We saw a glimpse

188
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:03,765
Speaker 8:  of a breath of the wild and Skyrim of all games. Oh yeah. And that was it.

189
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:07,925
Speaker 8:  So this isn't too far off the mark where we

190
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:11,605
Speaker 8:  have one fewer game and though second game was like a a,

191
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:15,605
Speaker 8:  a game that Bethesda has been trotting out for the last 20 years. So I don't

192
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:16,285
Speaker 8:  think we're missing much.

193
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:20,165
Speaker 6:  Why does Nintendo do this like this? Like the, the, I was, I was, I was thinking

194
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:23,125
Speaker 6:  about the cadence of this right before we were getting on and it's like,

195
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,725
Speaker 6:  okay, Nintendo puts out a video and then says we're gonna have more to share

196
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:30,765
Speaker 6:  at a direct in April three full months from

197
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:33,885
Speaker 6:  now and then there's gonna be a bunch of hands-on stuff and then it's launching

198
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:37,565
Speaker 6:  for some price at some time in the future this year, like

199
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:41,525
Speaker 6:  no other company launches a product like this. What what like

200
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:45,805
Speaker 6:  Andrew, I, I grant that trying to understand Nintendo as a company is, is

201
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:49,445
Speaker 6:  insane and no one should try to do it, but what is going on here?

202
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:50,605
Speaker 6:  Why would Nintendo,

203
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:54,645
Speaker 7:  This one is like very simple. Like the answer is the we you like when that

204
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:58,525
Speaker 7:  was announced, no one knew what this was like literally like

205
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,485
Speaker 7:  I remember writing the, the breaking news post and I was like, is this a

206
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:04,605
Speaker 7:  we accessory, is this new console? Like nobody knew. Oh, interesting. The

207
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:08,365
Speaker 7:  messaging around that was like so confusing and it was,

208
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,525
Speaker 7:  you know, a massive flaw after like

209
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,325
Speaker 7:  how do you mess up after the we that was like a huge breakthrough console,

210
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:15,645
Speaker 7:  right?

211
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:20,525
Speaker 7:  So like whatever you say about Nintendo, like they have become very

212
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:25,245
Speaker 7:  good and precise at messaging and so they are doing it

213
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:28,885
Speaker 7:  in stages so you don't mess things up. Like the first message is just like,

214
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:32,245
Speaker 7:  you know, you guys are safe. We didn't mess it up, we just made a bigger

215
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:36,125
Speaker 7:  we or a bigger switch. And then they get into the other stuff after

216
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,815
Speaker 7:  they like, I think they're just very

217
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:45,395
Speaker 7:  certain that like there's of what they wanna say

218
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:47,115
Speaker 7:  and they wanna make sure it gets out clearly.

219
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:51,155
Speaker 6:  So if that's true, it seems to me the one thing Nintendo

220
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:55,275
Speaker 6:  whiffed on is not saying something about

221
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:58,835
Speaker 6:  the processor. Like looking at our comments and looking at social and looking

222
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:01,835
Speaker 6:  all and, and like even my own reaction is like, the main thing I want to

223
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:05,195
Speaker 6:  know is if this thing is more powerful because

224
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:09,355
Speaker 6:  it needs to be, and the The Switch was like,

225
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,155
Speaker 6:  it wasn't underpowered when it came out, but it wasn't

226
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:17,865
Speaker 6:  powerful when it came out and it has like since gotten

227
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:22,105
Speaker 6:  sort of pathetic in a certain way, like as a raw horsepower

228
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:26,025
Speaker 6:  thing. And overwhelmingly like what people seem to have wanted

229
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:28,985
Speaker 6:  to know is like, is this thing going to be more powerful? Is it going to

230
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:31,505
Speaker 6:  be able to run the kinds of games that I want? Is it gonna be able to run

231
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:35,465
Speaker 6:  like new kinds of games over time? And we will

232
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:37,745
Speaker 6:  get the answer to that in two and a half months and maybe it doesn't matter

233
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:40,265
Speaker 6:  because it's a new switch and everybody's gonna buy it anyway. Richard, like

234
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:44,185
Speaker 6:  you were saying, but it does feel like that's the biggest detail that we

235
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:45,585
Speaker 6:  still don't know anything about.

236
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:48,865
Speaker 7:  But again, that's just like clouding their message. I think

237
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:53,465
Speaker 7:  you, I think you look at like the PS five pro reveal and they have like Mark

238
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:57,385
Speaker 7:  Cerney talking about whatever tariff flops are and like no normal

239
00:14:57,385 --> 00:15:01,225
Speaker 7:  person knows what that video is saying. Sure. And anyone who's complaining

240
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:04,665
Speaker 7:  about not knowing the specs is a person who's still gonna buy a new switch

241
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:08,065
Speaker 7:  anyways. Like Yeah I think that is like the thing

242
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:12,105
Speaker 7:  in the same way that the original video was like all about vibes, like this

243
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:15,385
Speaker 7:  is it, it's just they want, they don't wanna tell you everything. They want

244
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:19,265
Speaker 7:  to tell you the most important thing, which is it's The Switch and

245
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:20,385
Speaker 7:  bigger. Like that's it. Right?

246
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:23,265
Speaker 6:  That's well that's the thing. It's like the, and and there were a bunch of

247
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:26,185
Speaker 6:  folks in our comments who were like, there this is like a passive aggressive

248
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:30,105
Speaker 6:  launch video, which I didn't immediately read it as,

249
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,105
Speaker 6:  but there is kind of something to that where Nintendo is like, yeah,

250
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:37,745
Speaker 6:  dumb asses switch to whatever, leave us

251
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:41,625
Speaker 6:  alone here. It's, and like there, there is a little bit to that where it's

252
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,625
Speaker 6:  like we don't have to tell you anything. It's a switch to you'll buy it shut

253
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:44,745
Speaker 6:  up.

254
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:48,625
Speaker 9:  Not only will you buy it, you'll buy several of these. Yeah, you'll own more

255
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:52,025
Speaker 9:  than one. You know it, we know it. Everyone knows it. We don't have to tell

256
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:55,385
Speaker 9:  you how powerful it is and really, I'm not sure of how powerful it is matters

257
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:58,385
Speaker 9:  that much because they don't, they don't need that much horsepower to be

258
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:01,945
Speaker 9:  a slightly better Fortnite machine. Like they need a little bit but, but

259
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,585
Speaker 9:  only a little And it's, it's, I think at this point

260
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:06,625
Speaker 8:  Nobody's playing Fortnite on The Switch.

261
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:08,985
Speaker 7:  Well we need to get Charles on here. You know

262
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,705
Speaker 9:  What it, you know what some of my teammates would, would disagree.

263
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:17,375
Speaker 8:  Not enough. Not a lot. But yeah, part of the thing that

264
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:21,175
Speaker 8:  makes Nintendo Nintendo is the fact that they are very good at doing more

265
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:24,735
Speaker 8:  with less. And I don't think I want to see them change that

266
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,855
Speaker 8:  anyway by building a better mousetrap or a more powerful mousetrap

267
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,695
Speaker 8:  anyway. So we can wait for them to reveal all of the

268
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:36,455
Speaker 8:  specs. The, the only thing that's of concern to me is the fact that, you

269
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:40,055
Speaker 8:  know, can we play games like Kingdom Hearts and not have to do it via cloud

270
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:43,895
Speaker 8:  streaming because that was not a great feeling at all. So as

271
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,455
Speaker 8:  long as it can take care of that, I'm okay.

272
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:50,915
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like to be clear like that stuff is important. It's just not the important

273
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:54,235
Speaker 7:  thing, which is the first message they want to be out there. Right.

274
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:58,395
Speaker 6:  And what is that message other than just yes, The Switch two exists? No,

275
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:01,595
Speaker 7:  That's it, it's it's the number two. That's it. That's the message.

276
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:06,395
Speaker 6:  I did see somebody, I think it was Brian CTE who wrote a thing who was like

277
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,995
Speaker 6:  weird. He, he had a lot of feelings about the fact that it was called The

278
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,435
Speaker 6:  Switch two and not the Super Switch or anything else. And he was saying it

279
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:17,355
Speaker 6:  was the first time ever that Nintendo has just done like the numeral after

280
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:21,395
Speaker 6:  the console, which I thought was sort of fascinating. And

281
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:23,995
Speaker 6:  it's like there there's a bunch of like Galaxy Brain theories you can have

282
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:27,355
Speaker 6:  about Nintendo as a company here and Andrew you have some of those and I'd

283
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:31,315
Speaker 6:  like to hear them, but I don't know there is, there is part of me that

284
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:34,995
Speaker 6:  is like this console is both exactly what I wanted and maybe less

285
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:37,995
Speaker 6:  imaginative than you would expect from a company like Nintendo right

286
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:41,835
Speaker 8:  Now. Well can you, If you imagine like them calling it the Super

287
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:45,315
Speaker 8:  Switch or The Switch Advance or something like that, I feel like that

288
00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:49,075
Speaker 8:  muddles the message more than just calling it The Switch

289
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:52,525
Speaker 8:  too, because unlike, you know,

290
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:55,925
Speaker 8:  PlayStation or whatever, like we, we know like the

291
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:59,445
Speaker 8:  the, The Switch is like a family console, right? And so you've got a lot

292
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,205
Speaker 8:  of grandmas and grandpas and people who don't know what video games are buying

293
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:06,165
Speaker 8:  these consoles for their kids or even for themselves and muddying it by calling

294
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:09,605
Speaker 8:  it like a Super Switch or a switch advance or some other, you know, kind

295
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:13,125
Speaker 8:  of name kind of messes with that. I'm sorry, I'm trying not to curse and

296
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,565
Speaker 8:  just calling it simply The Switch too clearly informs those,

297
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:20,005
Speaker 8:  those kinds of buyers that okay, this is the next step. It's

298
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:22,325
Speaker 6:  Like the opposite of the Ds, which I feel like by the end of it had like

299
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:26,245
Speaker 6:  800 names that were totally indiscernible from one

300
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:26,405
Speaker 6:  another.

301
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:30,125
Speaker 8:  Yeah, you had the three Ds and the two Ds and you know, xl.

302
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:34,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So you had no idea If you were like a layman for lack of a better

303
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:38,165
Speaker 8:  term. Like okay, what does, what is this an advancement? Is this like a

304
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:42,125
Speaker 8:  same thing but you know, with more bells and whistles keep a simple stupid

305
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:46,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think you just need to look at like Xbox's naming scheme to see

306
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:48,885
Speaker 7:  like how badly that can go. Yeah. Because

307
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:50,445
Speaker 8:  Like 100% you mean

308
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:54,205
Speaker 6:  Going from Xbox to 360 to one doesn't that, that's not,

309
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:55,805
Speaker 6:  that's not simple. That doesn't make sense to you.

310
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:59,485
Speaker 7:  Listen, anyone who's ever tried to put series x slash S in a headline

311
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:02,165
Speaker 7:  absolutely despises this naming scheme.

312
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:06,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That I mean that's fair. And the the PlayStation thing like

313
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:10,005
Speaker 6:  we made a PlayStation but better and it's called the PlayStation, like it

314
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:13,405
Speaker 6:  it does kind of work. That's that's fair. And Andrew, you also made the case

315
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:17,445
Speaker 6:  that I think is right, that this is like just an

316
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:21,125
Speaker 6:  incredible flex from Nintendo that they're like, yeah this thing we did almost

317
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:25,125
Speaker 6:  a decade ago, like we crushed it and you suckers are like still

318
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,685
Speaker 6:  trying to catch up to this thing that we did forever ago and so we're just

319
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:32,565
Speaker 6:  gonna kick it and continue to win because we

320
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:36,085
Speaker 6:  are a thousand miles ahead of where everyone else has been this entire time.

321
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:40,445
Speaker 7:  Yeah and like everything about the way they did this to even like

322
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:44,525
Speaker 7:  not pre announcing it, like Nintendo usually is like, you

323
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:48,485
Speaker 7:  know, on Wednesday we're gonna have a direct and we're gonna announce blah

324
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:52,245
Speaker 7:  blah blah and they give some information. This was like, nope, it's 8:00 AM

325
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:55,885
Speaker 7:  on a Thursday, here's our new console. So it's like they know

326
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,485
Speaker 7:  like people will pay attention no matter what. Yeah.

327
00:19:58,485 --> 00:20:01,925
Speaker 6:  Richard, what do you make of this thing? Is this, is this everything you

328
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:02,485
Speaker 6:  wanted it to be?

329
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,485
Speaker 9:  How does it work with the alarm mode?

330
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:07,445
Speaker 6:  Maybe that's what the USB port is for

331
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:10,125
Speaker 9:  When I know the answer to that question I'll have have my answer for you,

332
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:13,725
Speaker 9:  but I mean otherwise yeah. You know, it's a switch. It, it will continue

333
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:16,645
Speaker 9:  to switch and I thought that it was interesting it, especially when you look

334
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:19,805
Speaker 9:  back at the original video for the, for the first switch

335
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:24,365
Speaker 9:  that the, the actual joy, the actual kickstand is better

336
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:27,645
Speaker 9:  now. So you can actually use it to do the things that they advertise the

337
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:31,365
Speaker 9:  first one to do. Yeah. So maybe an admission of some mistakes, but yes,

338
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:34,845
Speaker 9:  that overall their, their viewpoint that their angle, that the, the way that

339
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:36,845
Speaker 9:  they're going, they're saying this is right.

340
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:40,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I don't know. There there is a thing where it's like this is, this

341
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:44,565
Speaker 6:  is the equivalent of like the iPhone 12 to 13 where they're just

342
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:47,365
Speaker 6:  like, we made everything a little better. We've been working on the things

343
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:50,405
Speaker 6:  that you work on and now here's some new ones.

344
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:55,525
Speaker 6:  And I, I can't decide how much of me is

345
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:00,005
Speaker 6:  bummed that Nintendo didn't do something insane and weird and

346
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:03,645
Speaker 6:  potentially bad because I think that's like fun and interesting versus

347
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:08,155
Speaker 6:  assuming the specs are what I think that they are. Like when I look at my

348
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:11,715
Speaker 6:  switch, my, I have this like gross yellow switch from

349
00:21:11,715 --> 00:21:15,635
Speaker 6:  2017 that I still use and literally all I want out of

350
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:19,595
Speaker 6:  it is a faster wifi chip. Like the, the wifi on my

351
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:23,475
Speaker 6:  switch is trash and if they would just make it fast wifi so that

352
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:27,235
Speaker 6:  my pings would go down in the games I play online, I would be perfectly happy

353
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:30,675
Speaker 6:  with this console. And so I'm, I'm torn between like I wish they had done

354
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:33,675
Speaker 6:  more and also like I'm super, super glad they didn't do more

355
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:38,275
Speaker 6:  and like we unify The Switch and make it worse. There's

356
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:42,155
Speaker 8:  Still time, I mean there's a lot of breathing room between now

357
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:46,115
Speaker 8:  and April 2nd that is fair for them to show, you know, go crazy with it.

358
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:48,075
Speaker 8:  So I mean don't count 'em out.

359
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:51,595
Speaker 6:  What crazy is there to do though? That's The Switch too. They're like, yeah

360
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:53,115
Speaker 6:  we finished this thing years ago,

361
00:21:53,585 --> 00:21:57,355
Speaker 8:  It's Nintendo. They have ways of surprising, like we have no

362
00:21:57,355 --> 00:22:00,475
Speaker 8:  idea what they, it's in what's in store for us. Kind of like what Andrew

363
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:03,635
Speaker 8:  has written about on The Verge about like I've given up trying to predict

364
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:07,155
Speaker 8:  what Nintendo will do. They still have that element of, you know, the ability

365
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:07,835
Speaker 8:  to surprise.

366
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:11,395
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I do think the the the surprise things will be

367
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:16,105
Speaker 7:  not directly tied to the console. It'll be like we're using this in some

368
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:20,025
Speaker 7:  weird way in like a Labo like project. 'cause that's

369
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:23,505
Speaker 7:  like, you know, doing it, making it a core part of the console is like

370
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:27,305
Speaker 7:  a huge risk which they don't want to take obviously,

371
00:22:28,165 --> 00:22:31,665
Speaker 7:  but you know, if no one buys some weird ass cardboard device,

372
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:36,305
Speaker 7:  you know, they're still experimenting but it's not like a big loss. So I

373
00:22:36,305 --> 00:22:39,385
Speaker 7:  think they're still gonna take weird swings because that's who they are.

374
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,825
Speaker 7:  But I think it's just not baked into the hardware

375
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:45,665
Speaker 6:  And I feel like the last decade of big swings in gaming

376
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,505
Speaker 6:  sort of teaches us that that's the right approach. Right? I feel like every

377
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:52,945
Speaker 6:  time, and Microsoft just can't help itself from doing this, but every time

378
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:57,105
Speaker 6:  somebody has a big bonkers idea that they like build into the

379
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:00,905
Speaker 6:  console in a really meaningful way, it goes sideways, right? Microsoft is

380
00:23:00,905 --> 00:23:04,305
Speaker 6:  like, we're gonna reinvent entertainment through the Xbox and everybody's

381
00:23:04,305 --> 00:23:07,545
Speaker 6:  like, no thank you. And then they're like, the connect is now bundled in

382
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:10,865
Speaker 6:  and everybody's like, no thank you. Whereas like the PlayStation has just

383
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:13,865
Speaker 6:  continued to be like, it's mostly about playing games with a controller sitting

384
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:16,945
Speaker 6:  on your couch If you want some other stuff, here's some other stuff that

385
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:19,745
Speaker 6:  we'll sell you, here's VR and here's Move and here's all these other things.

386
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:23,425
Speaker 6:  If you want those things, terrific. But fundamentally we're just building

387
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:27,305
Speaker 6:  a thing to hold in your hands and play games. That has continued to be

388
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:30,745
Speaker 6:  the thing that works. And I feel like even with the first switch, what

389
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:34,625
Speaker 6:  Nintendo has done is essentially build a pretty straightforward thing

390
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:37,385
Speaker 6:  and an escalating series of insane accessories.

391
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:41,345
Speaker 7:  Even like the gimmicks that they had initially. Like no one uses them. I

392
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:43,865
Speaker 7:  don't know If you guys remember when like The Switch was announced and they

393
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:47,445
Speaker 7:  were testing it, like HD Rumble was like a big thing and they were like showing

394
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:50,925
Speaker 7:  executives like listening to Ice cubes. You could tell how many ice cubes

395
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:54,645
Speaker 7:  were falling into something by the vibrations and that's like

396
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:58,885
Speaker 7:  a relatively minor gimmick and didn't end up, you know, they enforce every

397
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:01,525
Speaker 7:  developer to put that in their games and so it didn't screw things up but

398
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:05,405
Speaker 7:  like that's the kind of thing I think we're gonna see is like stuff

399
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:07,165
Speaker 7:  that you can ignore if, If you need to

400
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:09,885
Speaker 9:  Street fast is coming back. Hmm. Get ready.

401
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:11,965
Speaker 7:  That's what, that's what the button's for

402
00:24:12,725 --> 00:24:15,045
Speaker 8:  Picto chat. I want Picto chat back.

403
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:16,565
Speaker 6:  What was Picto chat dude

404
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:17,645
Speaker 8:  From the the ds?

405
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:19,445
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah,

406
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:21,605
Speaker 8:  That was

407
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:22,205
Speaker 6:  Fun. Oh my

408
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:24,685
Speaker 7:  God, I don't know If you want Picto chat in. Okay.

409
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:26,245
Speaker 8:  Yeah, maybe not 2025 now.

410
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:29,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it was simpler times when we hit Picto chat.

411
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:35,755
Speaker 6:  So what Andrew, your, your long national nightmare of having to

412
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:37,675
Speaker 6:  follow The Switch to launch is is not over.

413
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:42,555
Speaker 6:  What is the next kind of drumbeat here?

414
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:45,675
Speaker 7:  Well, we'll see, I mean they said they're gonna talk about in April, but

415
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:49,195
Speaker 7:  I've also been hearing there may be like a gaming

416
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:53,355
Speaker 7:  direct games focused direct in February, so

417
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:57,285
Speaker 7:  there's gonna be more beats to this and there will probably be

418
00:24:58,035 --> 00:25:01,445
Speaker 7:  dropped on us on a random evening of

419
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:03,045
Speaker 7:  importance for American politics.

420
00:25:03,995 --> 00:25:06,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean there's one of those coming up on Monday, so like it's it might

421
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:06,965
Speaker 6:  happen.

422
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,245
Speaker 7:  That's when the price is coming.

423
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:09,565
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Right.

424
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:12,165
Speaker 6:  What do you guys think the price is gonna be? Let's, let's make some educated

425
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:15,405
Speaker 6:  guesses here. What do we think this thing is gonna cost

426
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:18,835
Speaker 8:  If it costs more than $400? I'll be surprised.

427
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:21,345
Speaker 6:  What was the original switch when it

428
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:25,145
Speaker 8:  Came out? 300. Okay, let's set that. And the OLED was three 50, like

429
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:28,985
Speaker 8:  the 404 50, that's it. And even four 50

430
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:32,305
Speaker 8:  sounds wrong in my ears. In my, yeah. To, to me

431
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:33,545
Speaker 6:  Four 50 feels like a lot.

432
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:37,345
Speaker 8:  Yeah it does. But if, I guess we have no way of knowing unless we know the,

433
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:41,225
Speaker 8:  the specs on it because four 50 absolutely might be a justified price depending

434
00:25:41,225 --> 00:25:44,905
Speaker 8:  on what's in that thing. But 400 has to be,

435
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,825
Speaker 8:  I mean Nintendo's a, they're not like, you know, a PlayStation or an Xbox

436
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:52,225
Speaker 8:  where they can show you the big shiny box and charge you like 600 bucks for

437
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:55,425
Speaker 8:  it because you know it's a family company and they, they work with families

438
00:25:55,425 --> 00:25:58,425
Speaker 8:  that have budgets and they don't wanna, you know, they wanna, they don't

439
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:01,865
Speaker 8:  wanna price people out like their core audience of people out. So it's gotta

440
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:05,705
Speaker 8:  be, you know, of course adjusted for inflation and the cost of like

441
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:09,825
Speaker 8:  computer chips and things like that, but it still have to be affordable so

442
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:10,865
Speaker 8:  it's probably gonna be 400 bucks.

443
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:13,305
Speaker 6:  Richard, you're making a face that makes me think you're about to be like,

444
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,305
Speaker 6:  it's a thousand dollars.

445
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:16,945
Speaker 9:  That's what The Switch to pro will be.

446
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,745
Speaker 9:  I think the, I think The Switch to like, maybe they'll just keep it at 300

447
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:22,585
Speaker 9:  or three 50.

448
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:24,425
Speaker 8:  That would be incredible. I

449
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:28,145
Speaker 9:  Think one of the questions I have is like, is The Switch going to, is the

450
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:30,665
Speaker 9:  original switch that's going to kind of disappear? I, I expected it won't,

451
00:26:30,665 --> 00:26:34,065
Speaker 9:  they'll keep selling it and sell them side by side at least for a while.

452
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:38,145
Speaker 9:  And how long is it until we get games that are only for The Switch too? Or

453
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:41,225
Speaker 9:  do they have reduced capabilities if you're playing on The Switch or, or

454
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,870
Speaker 9:  If you have like someone like that in your party or something like that.

455
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:47,805
Speaker 9:  That's probably the, I think the bigger question is, is

456
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:51,605
Speaker 9:  how quickly does your old switch get deprecated? Mm.

457
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:55,605
Speaker 7:  I like how all of Richard's answers relate to his Apex legend squad.

458
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:58,765
Speaker 9:  That's the most important thing. Yeah,

459
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:02,685
Speaker 6:  Don't take this away from me. Nintendo, Andrew, what about you? What do you

460
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:03,245
Speaker 6:  think? I've

461
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:07,085
Speaker 7:  Been trying to convert into American dollars. I do, I do think it'll be

462
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:10,845
Speaker 7:  like less than 400 because the whole point of them

463
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:14,805
Speaker 7:  having the lower specs is because they find the cheapest

464
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:18,885
Speaker 7:  tech older technology to squeeze into these things. So that's,

465
00:27:19,185 --> 00:27:23,085
Speaker 7:  if you're not gonna do that, then what's the point? Like you may as

466
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:26,525
Speaker 7:  well put out, you know, a powerful device if you're gonna go for a higher

467
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:30,325
Speaker 7:  price. So the whole point of cheaping it on there is like to pass

468
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:33,645
Speaker 7:  that on to consumers. So it's gotta be sub 400

469
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:37,765
Speaker 6:  If this thing stays at 2 99 or whatever, it's, that's gonna be pretty

470
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:38,685
Speaker 6:  spectacular.

471
00:27:39,035 --> 00:27:42,965
Speaker 7:  They're gonna do that and then put The Switch down to like a super

472
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:45,725
Speaker 7:  cheap price purely so they can beat the PS two.

473
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:47,405
Speaker 6:  Oh that's interesting. Yeah.

474
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:49,845
Speaker 7:  In terms of lifetime sales, that's what's gonna happen.

475
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:53,765
Speaker 6:  They just like, they, they want the, they want the victory even one Yeah.

476
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:56,085
Speaker 6:  Teeny tiny margin at a time. Yeah.

477
00:27:56,365 --> 00:28:00,085
Speaker 7:  I I think If you put like the, the original switch down to like a very cheap

478
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:01,525
Speaker 7:  price, it's still gonna move a ton.

479
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:05,855
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean truly other than, well okay I have two grapes

480
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:08,655
Speaker 6:  with my switch and thank you for coming to my Ted talk about the things I

481
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:12,415
Speaker 6:  hate about my 7-year-old switch. One is that I lost the cable

482
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:15,135
Speaker 6:  for the dock and I can't find another power cable for the dock that makes

483
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:18,375
Speaker 6:  it work. So it's just, it's just useless now because it only works at the

484
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:21,975
Speaker 6:  one stupid cable and I don't wanna buy a whole nother doc just for the one

485
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:25,925
Speaker 6:  stupid cable and the other one is the wifi

486
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:29,725
Speaker 6:  chip. Just simple things. They're like, and, and then like people have had

487
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:33,445
Speaker 6:  issues with the joycons over the years. I think they're like fine. But I

488
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,445
Speaker 6:  know a lot of people are much more sophisticated controller users than I

489
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:39,845
Speaker 6:  am who are very curious about how these joycons are gonna work. I just feel

490
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:42,805
Speaker 6:  like there's, there's all these like little tiny things that if Nintendo

491
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,695
Speaker 6:  would just do those and change nothing else, I will be a very happy

492
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:49,735
Speaker 6:  owner of somewhere between one and six switch tos.

493
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:53,535
Speaker 8:  We'll see what colors they come up with and if they release like a special

494
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:57,175
Speaker 8:  win waker edition because that one is gonna sell like hotcakes.

495
00:28:57,475 --> 00:29:01,195
Speaker 6:  Do we think there's gonna be another like huge

496
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:03,835
Speaker 6:  earth shattering game that comes with it? I mean like we got Breath of the

497
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:07,815
Speaker 6:  Wild with The Switch. Is Mario Kart gonna

498
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:10,375
Speaker 6:  be that thing for The Switch too? Like is that just where we're headed? Could

499
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:10,735
Speaker 6:  be Mario

500
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:14,615
Speaker 7:  Kart could be the Pokemon 'cause that's like a huge launch style Pokemon.

501
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:18,255
Speaker 7:  What the hell is it called? Legend Z.

502
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:18,655
Speaker 8:  It's legend.

503
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:22,855
Speaker 7:  ZAZA. Yeah, I think either of those is, that's like a launch

504
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:26,815
Speaker 7:  title for sure. Those are bestselling games. I love Metro

505
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,895
Speaker 7:  but that's not like a A system seller for No for launch.

506
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:33,615
Speaker 7:  So either one of those. You're good.

507
00:29:35,095 --> 00:29:36,855
Speaker 8:  Probably a new 3D Mario.

508
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:38,165
Speaker 7:  Yes,

509
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:41,805
Speaker 6:  That's true. Yeah. But even that doesn't feel quite as big as

510
00:29:42,745 --> 00:29:46,245
Speaker 6:  as like Pokemon feels like the only one that's kind of at the level of Zelda

511
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:49,485
Speaker 6:  in terms of like culture shaking release. Nah,

512
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:50,365
Speaker 6:  the

513
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:52,965
Speaker 8:  Terrible. I feel like Mario occupies that space as well. You

514
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:53,485
Speaker 6:  Think? Yeah.

515
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:54,925
Speaker 7:  Terrible movie made a billion dollars

516
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:59,965
Speaker 6:  So I mean that's fair. Other people who aren't you liked that movie

517
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:00,685
Speaker 6:  I will say,

518
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:03,125
Speaker 7:  Well they haven't had to watch it as many times as me.

519
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:05,965
Speaker 6:  So did you like it the first time you saw it?

520
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,005
Speaker 7:  It was fine. It was, it was inoffensive.

521
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:12,485
Speaker 6:  Now you're just increasingly mad at the song peaches every time you hear

522
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:14,045
Speaker 6:  it. Is that, is that what's happening? Pretty much.

523
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:20,005
Speaker 6:  Fair enough. Anything else on the, on The Switch? Do we, we're still in this

524
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:22,285
Speaker 6:  place where like this thing has launched and we still don't know all that

525
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:24,525
Speaker 6:  much about it's gonna very three

526
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:25,845
Speaker 9:  Months talk about, let's do it, let's get into it.

527
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:29,725
Speaker 8:  Let's not, I hope The Switch two cartridges taste better.

528
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:32,745
Speaker 6:  Do you?

529
00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:34,065
Speaker 8:  No, let's, let's

530
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:34,465
Speaker 6:  Talk about that.

531
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:37,385
Speaker 8:  That was a choke

532
00:30:39,535 --> 00:30:40,025
Speaker 6:  Richard.

533
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:41,865
Speaker 7:  We do not, we do not endorse child

534
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,425
Speaker 8:  Danger material. Yeah, please don't. Please don't put those in your mouth

535
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:48,345
Speaker 6:  Richard. You can have 20 seconds to talk about DL Ss and then we're taking

536
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:50,065
Speaker 6:  a break. Here you go. Ready? I go. I'm just

537
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:53,145
Speaker 9:  Saying that AI in graphics processing is very important. It could be really

538
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:57,065
Speaker 9:  relevant to the games that we play on our switch tools. It it is the number

539
00:30:57,265 --> 00:30:59,585
Speaker 9:  one factor that I'm waiting to hear more about. Thank you.

540
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:02,945
Speaker 6:  There we go. Alright, we're gonna take a break. Ash and Andrew, thank you

541
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,105
Speaker 6:  guys for being here. Unfortunately

542
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:51,525
Speaker 6:  All right, we're back. Addie Robertson's here. Hi Addie. Hi. Our

543
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:55,485
Speaker 6:  resident RedNote expert, as it turns out, was just teaching us how to pronounce

544
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:59,325
Speaker 6:  the correct name of everybody's favorite new TikTok competitor. Do you want

545
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:01,405
Speaker 6:  to, do you wanna give us a lesson here on what it's actually called?

546
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:05,765
Speaker 10:  I need to caveat this that I am not Chinese and I have not spoken

547
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:08,725
Speaker 10:  Chinese for a very long time. My impression is

548
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:12,125
Speaker 6:  Okay, Richard, how do you feel about that?

549
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:17,755
Speaker 9:  I'm getting there. Yeah, a little. I feel like I feel like I'm getting I

550
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:20,155
Speaker 9:  I'll, I'll have it by the next week. I'll be a star on

551
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:21,155
Speaker 10:  The first

552
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:26,435
Speaker 10:  is as little and then Hong is red

553
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:28,395
Speaker 10:  and then Shu, which is book

554
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:32,325
Speaker 6:  It's, this app is literally called Little Red Book

555
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,065
Speaker 10:  I believe so yeah,

556
00:35:34,705 --> 00:35:36,105
Speaker 9:  I think the US governor is gonna love that

557
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:40,325
Speaker 10:  Possible that, you know, there's a better colloquial translation.

558
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:44,605
Speaker 6:  This is what we've come to. So, okay, the, the scene setting I

559
00:35:44,605 --> 00:35:48,285
Speaker 6:  just wanna do here real quick before we get into it is the, the

560
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:52,485
Speaker 6:  potential TikTok ban is now two days away. As you're hearing

561
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:56,085
Speaker 6:  this three days away as we're recording it, we did a whole thing with Lauren

562
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:59,205
Speaker 6:  Finer on Tuesday show talking about what might happen and then it feels like

563
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:02,885
Speaker 6:  a hundred new possibilities appeared since Tuesday about what might happen.

564
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:07,325
Speaker 6:  So I want to talk through some of the things that have come

565
00:36:07,325 --> 00:36:11,285
Speaker 6:  up, some of the things we think might be happening and the deep polarity

566
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:15,205
Speaker 6:  of what everyone has done in response to the impending TikTok

567
00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:15,445
Speaker 6:  ban.

568
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:20,685
Speaker 6:  But let me just start by throwing out some of the like

569
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:24,245
Speaker 6:  possible outcomes that seem to have arisen over the last few days and we

570
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:27,685
Speaker 6:  can talk a little bit about them. Outcome number one, I would say

571
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:32,365
Speaker 6:  probably most likely in terms of actual things that might happen is

572
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:35,805
Speaker 6:  some kind of delay in the ban.

573
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:41,165
Speaker 6:  Senator Ed Markey introduced something or said he was

574
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,885
Speaker 6:  gonna introduce something that would give it a 270 day extension to either

575
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:48,885
Speaker 6:  divest or be banned. There was, was it Trump was gonna do

576
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:51,805
Speaker 6:  an executive order that was gonna delay it by 60 or 90 days?

577
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:53,405
Speaker 10:  Yeah, he is floated one at least.

578
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:57,125
Speaker 6:  Okay, so a lot of ideas in the area that like we're just gonna kick the can

579
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,645
Speaker 6:  down the road a little bit. Addie do either. Does that, does that strike

580
00:37:00,645 --> 00:37:02,405
Speaker 6:  you as like a real plausible outcome here?

581
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:05,725
Speaker 10:  Well there was always the option of kicking the can down the road 90 days

582
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:09,685
Speaker 10:  if there is a deal in place and depending on the definition of

583
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,445
Speaker 10:  what a deal is, I think that's kind of where people le are leaning

584
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:16,325
Speaker 10:  is we're just gonna give them time to figure this out.

585
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:21,365
Speaker 10:  It seems pretty unlikely to me that they're going to pass a whole new law

586
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:23,645
Speaker 10:  in what, like three days.

587
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:29,285
Speaker 6:  I mean there's, there's some other stuff going on in in the political universe

588
00:37:29,285 --> 00:37:32,525
Speaker 6:  too. So I I think you're probably right on that. This is the thing that I

589
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:36,325
Speaker 6:  don't understand though is like, can anyone actually do this

590
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:40,205
Speaker 6:  stuff? 'cause there's like, there's, there's the ban on Sunday and

591
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:42,725
Speaker 6:  then there's an inauguration day on Monday and then

592
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:48,155
Speaker 6:  something will happen and TikTok will be back. Like there's, there's

593
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:51,475
Speaker 6:  rumors that TikTok is gonna go away just for a day and then potentially come

594
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:55,275
Speaker 6:  back. Like, I just dunno how to handicap the realistic possibility

595
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:56,555
Speaker 6:  of any of this right now.

596
00:37:56,945 --> 00:38:00,835
Speaker 10:  Some of it depends on what the Supreme Court does and unfortunately we have

597
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:04,595
Speaker 10:  been frantically waiting for a ruling for several

598
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:08,475
Speaker 10:  days now. But part of the question is, okay, so

599
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:12,915
Speaker 10:  the rule here is it's either banned or they have to bite dance

600
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:16,875
Speaker 10:  has to divest it. And the question of what divestiture means, like

601
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:20,675
Speaker 10:  what can actually satisfy that requirement is a little bit of an open

602
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:24,715
Speaker 10:  question. I think the thing that Trump really wants and that a lot of people

603
00:38:24,715 --> 00:38:28,395
Speaker 10:  really want is the idea that they can just switch a little bit of

604
00:38:28,395 --> 00:38:31,875
Speaker 10:  ownership around and maybe shuffle, shuffle the board a bit

605
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:36,445
Speaker 10:  in a way that satisfies the Chinese government and the ruling for divestiture.

606
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:40,085
Speaker 10:  And then nothing necessarily changes that much, but it comes under

607
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:44,445
Speaker 10:  the ownership of someone American and the Chinese government doesn't feel

608
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:48,085
Speaker 10:  like it's lost the TikTok algorithm or like it's gotten

609
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:51,965
Speaker 10:  strong armed. And then at that point, if there are disagreements,

610
00:38:51,985 --> 00:38:55,285
Speaker 10:  you still get to have this three month delay in which they could hammer

611
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:55,725
Speaker 10:  them out.

612
00:38:55,995 --> 00:38:59,285
Speaker 6:  What would that in theory look like? If it's, if it's basically, so the,

613
00:38:59,285 --> 00:39:02,965
Speaker 6:  the number I've heard at least is that this, the, the bar

614
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:06,685
Speaker 6:  for foreign ownership under this bill is I think it's 20%

615
00:39:06,685 --> 00:39:10,405
Speaker 6:  ownership. Yeah. So in theory all all bite dance would have to do is

616
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:14,605
Speaker 6:  find a way to lower its ownership stake under 20%

617
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:17,245
Speaker 6:  and then everything would be okay. Is that, is that the idea here?

618
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:21,165
Speaker 10:  I think that's a thing that could happen and could be logical. It is

619
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:24,605
Speaker 10:  possible that you could still then have questions about, all right, but

620
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:27,245
Speaker 10:  does ance still potentially have some kind of backdoor?

621
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:31,845
Speaker 10:  But at the very least, that does seem like it has

622
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:36,485
Speaker 10:  some kind of reasonable standard in the law that yeah, you just

623
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:39,015
Speaker 10:  reduce the, the dependence. I,

624
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,455
Speaker 6:  That just doesn't make any sense to me because again, like if, if the

625
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:45,815
Speaker 6:  big argument we're having here is about national security and access to data,

626
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:49,775
Speaker 6:  like, you know what buys you the back door is 20%. Like whether

627
00:39:49,795 --> 00:39:53,695
Speaker 6:  you have 49% or 20% or 99%,

628
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:57,295
Speaker 6:  like you're still gonna have the admin login, right? Richard? Like, am I,

629
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:00,975
Speaker 6:  am I insane here that it feels like this solves nothing? If this is an actual

630
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:01,975
Speaker 6:  thing we're gonna do, would

631
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:05,895
Speaker 9:  You give a 20% owner an admin login? Yeah. No, no, no. You're, you're,

632
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:08,855
Speaker 9:  you're a minority owner. No, no admin login for you. And they've already

633
00:40:08,855 --> 00:40:11,455
Speaker 9:  done some things like the project Texas moving the data around

634
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:15,495
Speaker 9:  it. It just, it sounds like we've got this group project that's due on Sunday

635
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:18,735
Speaker 9:  and no one has done the work. You know, you, you got the Chinese government,

636
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:21,415
Speaker 9:  they're not picking up the phone. You got one of these students that's already

637
00:40:21,415 --> 00:40:25,015
Speaker 9:  checked out Biden, he, he's, he's on his way out. This, this is not his grade.

638
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:28,495
Speaker 9:  You got someone coming in, but they're not gonna be here before the due date

639
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:31,575
Speaker 9:  and Congress and the Supreme Court just haven't done it.

640
00:40:31,975 --> 00:40:34,975
Speaker 10:  I really wish I had a clever way to build on this analogy, but the things

641
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:38,855
Speaker 10:  that complicate that are that a, nobody wants to finish the project. Everybody's

642
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:42,455
Speaker 10:  sick of this. Trump doesn't want to TikTok to shut down on his watch Biden

643
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:46,415
Speaker 10:  as far as we can tell, there's some level of buyer's remorse and the

644
00:40:46,415 --> 00:40:50,175
Speaker 10:  administration is maybe trying to find a way to delay it. And then

645
00:40:50,435 --> 00:40:54,255
Speaker 10:  the Chinese government, and by dance obviously before the ban, they're going

646
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:58,055
Speaker 10:  to give you the most apocalyptic pronouncement ever. They're not gonna say,

647
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,695
Speaker 10:  oh yeah, no, it's fine. We're in talks with all these other guys. They're

648
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:05,255
Speaker 10:  going to just wait until the last minute to see if they can hammer on a

649
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:05,975
Speaker 10:  deal. Yeah,

650
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:09,495
Speaker 6:  I mean to that end, there was a, a report going around. I forget exactly

651
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:13,135
Speaker 6:  where I thought that that one possible outcome is that TikTok will just kind

652
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:17,015
Speaker 6:  of performatively go away, just like pull the plug

653
00:41:17,015 --> 00:41:20,855
Speaker 6:  more aggressively than it even needs to on the 19th just to prove how

654
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:24,255
Speaker 6:  bad it would be if TikTok was gone. 'cause I think a lot of people have been

655
00:41:24,255 --> 00:41:27,895
Speaker 6:  talking about the idea that what might happen is it might just sort of slowly

656
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:30,895
Speaker 6:  degrade over time that people who have it on their phones will be able to

657
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:34,285
Speaker 6:  continue to use it. But that actually what might happen is TikTok will just

658
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:38,205
Speaker 6:  be like, oh, you wanna see TikTok gone? Tiktoks gone suck on that. And

659
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:42,285
Speaker 6:  it'll just be sort of, it'll, it'll just make everybody miss it

660
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:46,085
Speaker 6:  a little bit for 24 hours and then we'll come back on inauguration

661
00:41:46,105 --> 00:41:50,085
Speaker 6:  day with, with Chuchu the ceo, EO sitting on the day

662
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:54,055
Speaker 6:  I said Inauguration day with Trump. Like there's

663
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:56,575
Speaker 6:  a version of that that actually makes a lot of sense to me that TikTok is

664
00:41:56,575 --> 00:42:00,405
Speaker 6:  gonna be like, oh, you wanna ban us? Check this out. Just as a

665
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:00,645
Speaker 6:  flex,

666
00:42:01,075 --> 00:42:05,045
Speaker 10:  That both makes political sense and it might kind of be necessary

667
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:08,805
Speaker 10:  because hosting services also have to work with, have to cease working

668
00:42:08,805 --> 00:42:12,525
Speaker 10:  with by dance and Oracle hosts a bunch of American data,

669
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,485
Speaker 10:  right? So it's possible that you're gonna see that no matter what.

670
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:20,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I So are we really at a point where like just

671
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:23,365
Speaker 6:  none of this makes sense and anything could happen? I guess we might get

672
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:27,285
Speaker 6:  a real answer if and when we hear from the Supreme Court, which I would

673
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:30,645
Speaker 6:  say we're all sort of surprised, has taken this long to issue any kind of

674
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:31,765
Speaker 6:  pronouncement about how it

675
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:34,765
Speaker 10:  Feels. I think not everyone is surprised, but it is definitely

676
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:38,525
Speaker 10:  very annoying and not people's first choice.

677
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:43,355
Speaker 10:  This is also all ignoring the, obviously I say this

678
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:47,155
Speaker 10:  in a way where it's bad, but to me, much like by far funniest option, which

679
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:50,675
Speaker 10:  is the law goes into effect and Trump says he's not going to enforce it.

680
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:54,275
Speaker 10:  And then he asked all of the app stores have to play chicken

681
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:58,435
Speaker 10:  and like see if they're going to go with these rules.

682
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:03,475
Speaker 10:  So, which based on Supreme Court arguments, it sounds like that's still

683
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:07,355
Speaker 10:  a pretty huge risk for them, but that is still an outcome that

684
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:08,955
Speaker 10:  people have not completely ruled out.

685
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:11,435
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Can you just game that out a little bit? We talked about this with

686
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,915
Speaker 6:  Lauren A. Little on Tuesday too, but it, it does seem like this question

687
00:43:14,935 --> 00:43:18,905
Speaker 6:  of if, if Trump puts out an executive order on

688
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:21,785
Speaker 6:  day one saying, I'm not going to enforce this law

689
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:27,135
Speaker 6:  for some period of time, in theory, everyone could just

690
00:43:27,135 --> 00:43:31,095
Speaker 6:  go terrific and resume business as normal and, and TikTok

691
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,215
Speaker 6:  continues, but there, there, there seems to be this sort of extent

692
00:43:35,455 --> 00:43:39,335
Speaker 6:  pressure on all of the players that exist even outside of that.

693
00:43:39,395 --> 00:43:42,255
Speaker 6:  Can you just explain like what, what the tension is there for those companies?

694
00:43:42,385 --> 00:43:42,735
Speaker 6:  There

695
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:46,615
Speaker 10:  Are a few different tensions. The first tension is that it is very risky

696
00:43:46,715 --> 00:43:50,535
Speaker 10:  to trust Trump's loyalty on a thing. And that this

697
00:43:50,535 --> 00:43:53,855
Speaker 10:  creates a lot of leverage to, If you make him mad,

698
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:58,215
Speaker 10:  let him do something that's going to hurt you very badly. There is

699
00:43:58,215 --> 00:44:02,015
Speaker 10:  also the chance that the administration could be held in contempt of court

700
00:44:02,155 --> 00:44:05,455
Speaker 10:  if they have gotten an explicit order to enforce this law and they just

701
00:44:05,455 --> 00:44:09,335
Speaker 10:  refuse to. And then there's also the chance that even if they say they're

702
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:13,055
Speaker 10:  not going to enforce it, the platforms and the app stores say, yeah, this

703
00:44:13,055 --> 00:44:15,855
Speaker 10:  is just too big a risk. It doesn't matter what you say, we're kicking them

704
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:16,055
Speaker 10:  off.

705
00:44:16,205 --> 00:44:19,775
Speaker 6:  Richard, what would you do if, if I'm who in this? You're Google,

706
00:44:20,435 --> 00:44:23,815
Speaker 6:  you're, you're Sundar Phai and you're, you're sitting there in front of the

707
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:27,615
Speaker 6:  TikTok is in the app store switch, what are you doing? I'm

708
00:44:27,615 --> 00:44:28,815
Speaker 6:  replacing it with YouTube shorts.

709
00:44:32,435 --> 00:44:35,605
Speaker 6:  Just every time someone searches TikTok, it just instantly takes you to YouTube

710
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:38,765
Speaker 6:  shorts. The thing is that I love is that Google legitimately has the power

711
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:42,805
Speaker 6:  technically to just do that. Like If you google TikTok, it's like,

712
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,205
Speaker 6:  nevermind, you want to YouTube shorts, right?

713
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:46,005
Speaker 9:  There's only YouTube shorts now

714
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:51,125
Speaker 6:  TikTok never existed. You didn't even, you TikTok was a figment of your

715
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:55,085
Speaker 6:  imagination. There has only ever been YouTube shorts. Speaking

716
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:59,045
Speaker 6:  of YouTube shorts, this comes back to our favorite

717
00:44:59,105 --> 00:45:03,045
Speaker 6:  app, RedNote slash Little Red Book. One of the

718
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:07,205
Speaker 6:  funniest things that has happened this week is a lot of people, rather

719
00:45:07,555 --> 00:45:10,655
Speaker 6:  than leave TikTok for

720
00:45:12,065 --> 00:45:16,055
Speaker 6:  quote unquote more stable places like Instagram or YouTube

721
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:19,775
Speaker 6:  shorts, these other platforms that have just basically relentlessly copied

722
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:23,775
Speaker 6:  TikTok for several years. People have instead gone the other way and found

723
00:45:24,845 --> 00:45:26,295
Speaker 6:  more Chinese apps.

724
00:45:27,885 --> 00:45:31,175
Speaker 6:  RedNote and Lemonade being I would say the, the big two.

725
00:45:32,385 --> 00:45:35,895
Speaker 6:  Addie can you, can you explain what these apps are and how this is happening

726
00:45:35,895 --> 00:45:36,295
Speaker 6:  like this?

727
00:45:36,645 --> 00:45:40,215
Speaker 10:  Okay, so Lemonade and RedNote are both, they're

728
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:44,335
Speaker 10:  Chinese apps that present in theory basically all of the same

729
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:48,415
Speaker 10:  risks as TikTok Lemonade is owned by Ance the same parent

730
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,335
Speaker 10:  company as TikTok. And I feel like at this point right now,

731
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:55,695
Speaker 10:  there's a little bit of, it's kind of a free for all. People are just, this

732
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:59,655
Speaker 10:  is summer break, everybody's experimenting and that if TikTok were

733
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:03,175
Speaker 10:  long-term band, then we would see people say, I need to make

734
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:06,695
Speaker 10:  money. I'm going to go to these platforms even though I find them boring

735
00:46:06,715 --> 00:46:07,615
Speaker 10:  and they annoy me.

736
00:46:09,155 --> 00:46:13,095
Speaker 10:  So I don't know what the long-term future would be, but yeah, the short-term

737
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:16,615
Speaker 10:  future is that people have gone to just the exact

738
00:46:16,805 --> 00:46:20,535
Speaker 10:  same thing and possibly it to some level

739
00:46:20,565 --> 00:46:24,215
Speaker 10:  just to actively spite the people who passed this law.

740
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:27,895
Speaker 6:  Oh. I mean I think it's, I think it's extremely just spite those people.

741
00:46:27,975 --> 00:46:31,935
Speaker 6:  I mean the, the like goodbye to my Chinese spy thing has been, has

742
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,615
Speaker 6:  become rampant on TikTok and everybody's making fun of it by going to these

743
00:46:35,615 --> 00:46:39,535
Speaker 6:  apps. Like, what was the thing I saw today? Duolingo is booming and

744
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:42,695
Speaker 6:  suddenly ton tons of people are wanting to learn Mandarin in order to be

745
00:46:42,695 --> 00:46:46,535
Speaker 6:  on these apps. Like this bit has now gone so far that I'm like, at what point

746
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:49,695
Speaker 6:  is this not a bit, and at what point is everybody just going to excitedly

747
00:46:49,695 --> 00:46:51,935
Speaker 6:  start using Chinese social media apps?

748
00:46:52,095 --> 00:46:54,455
Speaker 9:  I think we're there. I think, I think we're at the point where it's, it has

749
00:46:54,455 --> 00:46:57,175
Speaker 9:  stopped being a bit, I mean people went over to this, this app,

750
00:46:58,645 --> 00:47:02,135
Speaker 9:  Schu Chu I'm gonna get there, I'm gonna get the pronunciation right

751
00:47:02,685 --> 00:47:06,215
Speaker 9:  just So I can, I can get my following up. They found out that Cardi B has

752
00:47:06,215 --> 00:47:10,095
Speaker 9:  been there for years posting really, you know this. Yes. The

753
00:47:10,115 --> 00:47:13,455
Speaker 9:  the weird thing about it is that unlike the other apps, they don't separate

754
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,695
Speaker 9:  their Chinese and American audience or Chinese and international audiences.

755
00:47:16,755 --> 00:47:19,935
Speaker 9:  So you suddenly have these people talking directly to people from China in

756
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:23,465
Speaker 9:  a way that they probably never have. And

757
00:47:23,535 --> 00:47:26,545
Speaker 9:  there's, there's something there. I, I don't know, I don't know how long

758
00:47:26,545 --> 00:47:30,325
Speaker 9:  it will last if it will be banned two or, or what, what might happen, but

759
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:33,955
Speaker 9:  something has happened also, American companies apparently

760
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:35,555
Speaker 9:  cannot make good algorithms.

761
00:47:35,985 --> 00:47:38,715
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I I will say I I have continued to be

762
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:43,155
Speaker 6:  flummoxed by this fact that like, it, it is clearly

763
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:46,835
Speaker 6:  true that there is something about TikTok that neither

764
00:47:46,835 --> 00:47:50,635
Speaker 6:  YouTube nor Instagram has replicated despite both

765
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:54,595
Speaker 6:  being desperate to replicate TikTok. Like they're just nakedly trying to

766
00:47:54,595 --> 00:47:57,315
Speaker 6:  do TikTok. They're not even trying to do like their own versions of TikTok.

767
00:47:57,315 --> 00:48:00,115
Speaker 6:  They're just trying to do TikTok and still

768
00:48:00,865 --> 00:48:04,115
Speaker 6:  nothing has been able to quite do it. And, and to your point, Richard, people

769
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:06,915
Speaker 6:  are, are flooding to these other apps and being like, yes, this gives me

770
00:48:06,915 --> 00:48:10,755
Speaker 6:  the same thing. And it is like, what, what have these Chinese companies

771
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:14,395
Speaker 6:  in particular by dance, which just keeps making identical looking apps under

772
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:17,955
Speaker 6:  different names, apparently they've just figured out some

773
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:22,555
Speaker 6:  turn in the system here that no one else has figured out or is willing to

774
00:48:22,555 --> 00:48:26,275
Speaker 6:  do or something. And it's just very strange to me, like somebody

775
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:30,555
Speaker 6:  Adam Macer should be able to just turn the dial to full TikTok

776
00:48:30,695 --> 00:48:34,535
Speaker 6:  and they should have just known how to do this by now and yet they

777
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:34,815
Speaker 6:  can't.

778
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:38,535
Speaker 9:  Yeah. I mean, have you used Instagram reels? Like, it's awesome. Sometimes

779
00:48:38,535 --> 00:48:42,255
Speaker 9:  I'll get stuff that I like, but sometimes it'll show me like something absolutely

780
00:48:42,575 --> 00:48:46,415
Speaker 9:  horrible that makes me never want to open that app again. And TikTok has

781
00:48:46,415 --> 00:48:47,295
Speaker 9:  that problem much less,

782
00:48:47,575 --> 00:48:51,295
Speaker 6:  I will say YouTube is the one that really gets me. YouTube is the, is the

783
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:54,255
Speaker 6:  one that I hate the most and frustrates me the most because YouTube,

784
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,985
Speaker 6:  no service on the internet has as much

785
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:03,785
Speaker 6:  good declarative information about what I want than

786
00:49:03,785 --> 00:49:07,065
Speaker 6:  YouTube. I have clicked on so many things on YouTube on purpose

787
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:11,665
Speaker 6:  for 15 years. I have been like, I would like to watch this video for

788
00:49:11,665 --> 00:49:15,585
Speaker 6:  20 minutes, like it should have my interests nailed. And

789
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:18,145
Speaker 6:  like YouTube music is actually very good as a result of that because you

790
00:49:18,145 --> 00:49:20,385
Speaker 6:  turn on YouTube music and it just looks at everything you've ever watched

791
00:49:20,385 --> 00:49:23,905
Speaker 6:  and listened to on YouTube before and suddenly starts giving you recommendations.

792
00:49:23,905 --> 00:49:27,225
Speaker 6:  So the, like the Cold Start problem there is solved and it's awesome

793
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:32,155
Speaker 6:  and yet shorts is nonsense. Like it doesn't make any sense to me that it's

794
00:49:32,155 --> 00:49:36,075
Speaker 6:  like you YouTube knows me or should know me better than

795
00:49:36,075 --> 00:49:40,035
Speaker 6:  any service on the internet and it cannot figure out which short to

796
00:49:40,235 --> 00:49:43,315
Speaker 6:  recommend to me. And like, and TikTok is just like, do you wanna watch New

797
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:45,795
Speaker 6:  Girl Clips? And I'm like, sure, I'll watch New Girl Clips. Like, great, let's

798
00:49:45,795 --> 00:49:48,315
Speaker 6:  do it. YouTube cannot do that. And it drives me nuts.

799
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,675
Speaker 9:  And Eddie, Eddie, I wanna know what you think about this, but I, I think

800
00:49:51,675 --> 00:49:55,315
Speaker 9:  that the saying goodbye to my Chinese spy taps into

801
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:58,835
Speaker 9:  my personal conspiracy theory about TikTok that I've always had, which is

802
00:49:58,835 --> 00:50:02,195
Speaker 9:  that, and also about a lot of AI things is that it's not ai, it's just a

803
00:50:02,195 --> 00:50:05,435
Speaker 9:  guy named Al. And that there's a lot more human curation behind the scenes.

804
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,515
Speaker 9:  And that's why it's so good is because you're kind of tapping into these

805
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:12,515
Speaker 9:  cues of content and there's just someone saying, oh yeah, that's a good video.

806
00:50:12,515 --> 00:50:16,315
Speaker 9:  I'll put it at the top. And that's why you keep getting good videos. That's,

807
00:50:16,315 --> 00:50:20,195
Speaker 9:  that's my guess. And I, whatever it

808
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:22,555
Speaker 9:  is, it would be great if someone else could figure it out because someone

809
00:50:22,555 --> 00:50:26,435
Speaker 9:  needs to know that I want to see 1980s car ads and that's

810
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:29,095
Speaker 9:  the only thing I wanna see. And If you just show me that I'll never close

811
00:50:29,095 --> 00:50:31,615
Speaker 9:  the app ever again. But Eddie, what do you think?

812
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:36,055
Speaker 10:  I unfortunately cannot speak to the actual algorithmic changes here. I know

813
00:50:36,055 --> 00:50:39,975
Speaker 10:  that for a long time, TikTok did really push to be sort of the

814
00:50:39,975 --> 00:50:43,855
Speaker 10:  shiny happy place on the internet, which sometimes produce weird, very

815
00:50:44,035 --> 00:50:47,815
Speaker 10:  bad effects. Like it would demote content from people who seemed likely

816
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,735
Speaker 10:  to be bullied, which was say LGBT people.

817
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:55,895
Speaker 10:  But it's possible that it's just optimizing for a different metric than

818
00:50:57,205 --> 00:51:00,985
Speaker 10:  say Instagram or which is constantly dialing up and down

819
00:51:00,985 --> 00:51:04,585
Speaker 10:  things like political content and news and can't seem to figure out what

820
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:08,385
Speaker 10:  it's going for. At least that's meta in general. So I

821
00:51:08,385 --> 00:51:12,105
Speaker 10:  can't tell if it's that it would be a, it's badly tuned or if it's tuned

822
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:15,585
Speaker 10:  in a way that has sort of different business logic

823
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:19,745
Speaker 10:  and that just produces less of a certain thing or possibly that it's the

824
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:23,585
Speaker 10:  user base itself ended up producing a thing and the

825
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:25,785
Speaker 10:  network effects kind of snowballed that.

826
00:51:26,385 --> 00:51:29,425
Speaker 6:  I do think there's something to that last part in particular that I think

827
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:33,905
Speaker 6:  TikTok got kind of a last mover advantage that

828
00:51:34,005 --> 00:51:37,665
Speaker 6:  by, by being able to just show up from scratch and build something,

829
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:41,505
Speaker 6:  especially in kind of the, like it, it blew up in the

830
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:44,465
Speaker 6:  US especially during the pandemic when everything was weird and everybody

831
00:51:44,465 --> 00:51:47,905
Speaker 6:  just wanted like an escape and dance challenges suddenly made sense that

832
00:51:47,945 --> 00:51:51,545
Speaker 6:  I think in the same way that If you had just like in 2019 and

833
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:55,305
Speaker 6:  2020 just flooded Instagram with dance challenges, a lot of people actually

834
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:59,225
Speaker 6:  would've hated it. But on TikTok, because it was new and different and

835
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:03,105
Speaker 6:  people hadn't really experienced it yet it, it felt good.

836
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:06,945
Speaker 6:  And So I think like to some extent on Instagram and on other places,

837
00:52:06,945 --> 00:52:10,825
Speaker 6:  you're, you're trying to like, you have to unlearn some things before

838
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:13,825
Speaker 6:  you can relearn some things, whereas TikTok just got to show up and do things

839
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:17,385
Speaker 6:  differently. And I think that actually really worked to its benefit.

840
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:20,665
Speaker 6:  But then again, I keep coming back to this idea that everyone has decided

841
00:52:20,855 --> 00:52:24,825
Speaker 6:  that TikTok is the best at it. So just go do that. Like just piss

842
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:28,065
Speaker 6:  off all the Instagram users for three days and then they will decide that

843
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:31,625
Speaker 6:  they love it because everybody hates reels and the only thing anybody says

844
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:34,905
Speaker 6:  about reels is that it is just old tiktoks. And so it's like you're, you

845
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:38,505
Speaker 6:  don't have anything to lose, just throw the thing away and make it TikTok

846
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:40,225
Speaker 6:  and it'll probably work.

847
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:44,665
Speaker 9:  Throwing out the rule book had had some advantages and I think like a

848
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:47,385
Speaker 9:  lot of people during the pandemic, I opened up TikTok, I was kind of bored

849
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:50,425
Speaker 9:  and it immediately diagnosed me with a DH adhd, you know, waving an app.

850
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:53,865
Speaker 9:  It should not do, it's bad, it should not, no, that's, that's not diagnose

851
00:52:53,865 --> 00:52:55,945
Speaker 9:  medical conditions like that. It was correct

852
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:02,145
Speaker 9:  and Instagram reels doesn't really do that and I'm just like, you

853
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:05,505
Speaker 9:  could probably do a little bit more to, to figure out who your users are.

854
00:53:05,775 --> 00:53:07,105
Speaker 9:  Yeah, you have enough data.

855
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,145
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's just, it's just sitting there. So okay, we should talk about one

856
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:14,025
Speaker 6:  other possible TikTok outcome before we fully throw up our

857
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:17,745
Speaker 6:  hands and just wait for somebody to tell us what's happening, which is the

858
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:21,665
Speaker 6:  Elon Musk of it all. Richard, can you, can you make this make sense to me?

859
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:25,610
Speaker 6:  There, there has been some sort of loose reporting that maybe what'll

860
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,125
Speaker 6:  happen is Elon Musk will save TikTok.

861
00:53:27,595 --> 00:53:30,845
Speaker 9:  Well, in one of the possibilities that that you know, Addie has mentioned

862
00:53:30,905 --> 00:53:34,705
Speaker 9:  is that by dance could divest, that they could own less of TikTok.

863
00:53:34,705 --> 00:53:37,265
Speaker 9:  So someone would need to own more, someone who has a lot of money and who

864
00:53:37,265 --> 00:53:40,945
Speaker 9:  can get a lot of money because TikTok is unquestionably worth a lot.

865
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:44,865
Speaker 9:  So who can get a lot of money in a hurry to buy a social media site.

866
00:53:45,295 --> 00:53:48,625
Speaker 9:  Elon Musk, who is much loved in China, Elon Musk,

867
00:53:49,245 --> 00:53:52,945
Speaker 9:  who might be able to be influenced by the Chinese government because he needs

868
00:53:52,945 --> 00:53:56,825
Speaker 9:  to sell cars in the country and they control that and also the resources

869
00:53:56,825 --> 00:53:58,905
Speaker 9:  in the country to make those cars. Elon Musk

870
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:03,395
Speaker 9:  Fitz a lot, I mean I don't know if he checks all of the boxes, but he does

871
00:54:03,395 --> 00:54:04,035
Speaker 9:  check a lot of them.

872
00:54:04,385 --> 00:54:07,515
Speaker 10:  Also the box of being tied specifically to the Trump administration, which

873
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:08,995
Speaker 10:  has made China hawkishness a big deal.

874
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:12,955
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's as close as you can come to selling part of your company to

875
00:54:12,955 --> 00:54:16,595
Speaker 6:  the United States as you can kind of get right now is selling it to Elon

876
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:20,485
Speaker 6:  Musk. Do we think this is a real possibility, Addie, If you were to

877
00:54:20,485 --> 00:54:23,765
Speaker 6:  like handicap this on the list of possible outcomes, do you think this is

878
00:54:24,115 --> 00:54:28,005
Speaker 6:  like X absorbs TikTok is a, is a real thing that might

879
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:28,165
Speaker 6:  happen?

880
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:32,805
Speaker 10:  I might phrase it as TikTok absorbs X, but Sure, I think it's

881
00:54:32,825 --> 00:54:34,885
Speaker 10:  not impossible. It it seems like much,

882
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:37,725
Speaker 6:  You know, he'd rename it X though. He'd be, it would be called like X video

883
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:41,005
Speaker 6:  and everybody would be like, oh, I'm an X video now.

884
00:54:44,165 --> 00:54:47,965
Speaker 10:  I mean once all the porn sites get banned, X videos will be up for sale

885
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:51,885
Speaker 10:  again. Yeah, no, I think that for a while there

886
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:54,645
Speaker 10:  was a lot of noise about how the Chinese government absolutely was going

887
00:54:54,645 --> 00:54:58,165
Speaker 10:  to refuse, but given all the reports now it certainly doesn't seem

888
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:58,965
Speaker 10:  impossible.

889
00:54:59,305 --> 00:55:03,085
Speaker 6:  It seems like a terrible idea. Like I hate the idea that this might happen,

890
00:55:03,085 --> 00:55:06,405
Speaker 6:  which makes it potentially likely that it's going to happen. Yeah, like Richard

891
00:55:06,505 --> 00:55:10,485
Speaker 6:  to your point, no, like I, I think one of the, the two

892
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:14,245
Speaker 6:  things really that I have seen as, as total impediments to this are TikTok

893
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:17,965
Speaker 6:  is enormously expensive and China is not interested in

894
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:21,925
Speaker 6:  selling. And I do think it's possible that Elon Musk is the only person capable

895
00:55:22,025 --> 00:55:25,605
Speaker 6:  of solving both of those problems. He has clearly an infinite ability to

896
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:29,565
Speaker 6:  raise money and also, like you were just

897
00:55:29,565 --> 00:55:32,965
Speaker 6:  explaining is, is as palatable to the Chinese government as any person in

898
00:55:32,965 --> 00:55:34,605
Speaker 6:  the United States for a variety of reasons.

899
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:40,055
Speaker 6:  It like, it, it fits, I don't like it, but it kind of fits.

900
00:55:40,645 --> 00:55:42,655
Speaker 9:  Well I guess I'll see you guys on Seattle. Shoot,

901
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:47,495
Speaker 10:  I'm interested in it because I think it will be the absolute

902
00:55:47,795 --> 00:55:50,895
Speaker 10:  purest test of inertia you could possibly devise

903
00:55:51,605 --> 00:55:55,415
Speaker 10:  that TikTok is just so notoriously moderated

904
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:59,655
Speaker 10:  that is the thing that defines it. And it also, it is a place

905
00:55:59,655 --> 00:56:03,255
Speaker 10:  that tends to try to at least I think, focus on positivity

906
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:07,215
Speaker 10:  ostensibly that is the absolute opposite of what Elon Musk is interested

907
00:56:07,275 --> 00:56:11,215
Speaker 10:  in. It is a thing that is notably full of silos and

908
00:56:11,215 --> 00:56:14,895
Speaker 10:  you're trying to just split people up into the perfect

909
00:56:14,945 --> 00:56:18,575
Speaker 10:  thing for them as much as possible. And X has now become a thing that just

910
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,095
Speaker 10:  feeds you Elon tweets, they're just kind of polar

911
00:56:22,455 --> 00:56:26,445
Speaker 10:  opposites to each other. And it seems to be not really just a business decision

912
00:56:26,465 --> 00:56:29,565
Speaker 10:  on Musk's part, it's a thing that he just genuinely thinks social media

913
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:33,365
Speaker 10:  should be. And I'm very curious how the TikTok community would react to

914
00:56:33,365 --> 00:56:33,445
Speaker 10:  that.

915
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:37,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean I I, I keep coming back to, I, I made the, the ship of theses

916
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:42,125
Speaker 6:  comparison on Tuesday's show too, but there, there is to me

917
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:45,885
Speaker 6:  this real thing where like there is no version of TikTok that

918
00:56:45,885 --> 00:56:49,795
Speaker 6:  gets divested that still to me feels like TikTok

919
00:56:49,895 --> 00:56:53,875
Speaker 6:  and, and so it's like the upside is it, it would continue to be TikTok, it

920
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:57,775
Speaker 6:  would have a lot of users, it might be called X videos, but it,

921
00:56:57,775 --> 00:57:01,655
Speaker 6:  it would, the people wouldn't have to go somewhere else. And like you

922
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:04,775
Speaker 6:  said, that's a very powerful thing, but like,

923
00:57:05,575 --> 00:57:08,695
Speaker 6:  I don't know, it turns out people are willing to go somewhere else. The number

924
00:57:08,695 --> 00:57:12,015
Speaker 6:  of people who just randomly signed up for a, an app with

925
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:15,655
Speaker 6:  literally a Chinese name in the American app store, like

926
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:20,335
Speaker 6:  it, it actually turns out maybe the inertia is not nearly as strong as anybody

927
00:57:20,335 --> 00:57:22,895
Speaker 6:  thought that when people need somewhere to go, they'll go,

928
00:57:23,215 --> 00:57:26,335
Speaker 10:  I don't wanna overdetermine that given just how big TikTok is. And of course

929
00:57:26,335 --> 00:57:30,135
Speaker 10:  some people are going to jump ship, but I do. Yeah, it does

930
00:57:30,135 --> 00:57:34,095
Speaker 10:  seem like other platforms say x have meaningfully lost some number of

931
00:57:34,095 --> 00:57:35,935
Speaker 10:  users and that that definitely can happen.

932
00:57:36,605 --> 00:57:39,815
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean it, it is, I think the, the X thing is actually a really interesting

933
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:42,495
Speaker 6:  comparison there because like we, we've talked about this a lot where there

934
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:46,215
Speaker 6:  was the, there was the big boom on Mastodon that slowed down and then there

935
00:57:46,215 --> 00:57:49,735
Speaker 6:  was the big boom on threads that continues to happen. But

936
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:53,575
Speaker 6:  now threads is weird and there's now there's been a big boom on Blue Sky

937
00:57:53,575 --> 00:57:57,535
Speaker 6:  and Blue Sky is like meaningful and and large now, but is still

938
00:57:57,695 --> 00:58:01,495
Speaker 6:  a tiny fraction of the size of threads, which is still a fraction of the

939
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:05,255
Speaker 6:  size of X. And so maybe for Elon Musk what you've learned is,

940
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:09,855
Speaker 6:  I you you can weather these storms because they end up being really vocal

941
00:58:09,995 --> 00:58:11,695
Speaker 6:  and maybe not that sticky over time.

942
00:58:11,975 --> 00:58:15,255
Speaker 9:  I, I think one thing that gets really tricky there is what happens to cap

943
00:58:15,255 --> 00:58:19,055
Speaker 9:  cut in really any of these scenarios because in a way that's maybe

944
00:58:19,055 --> 00:58:22,895
Speaker 9:  different from all other kinds of social platforms, the way

945
00:58:22,895 --> 00:58:26,655
Speaker 9:  that you make the videos really influences the videos that are on the platform

946
00:58:26,655 --> 00:58:30,295
Speaker 9:  and the people who want to use the app and having an a video editor that

947
00:58:30,855 --> 00:58:34,015
Speaker 9:  a lot of people like to use and find easy to use to make really high quality

948
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:37,055
Speaker 9:  videos has been a huge part of tiktoks appeal.

949
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:42,535
Speaker 9:  So that's a kind of just another question that has to be asked. And in the,

950
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:45,255
Speaker 9:  in the case of something like X or something like that, that's, that's not

951
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,775
Speaker 9:  really the issue. You, you everyone can type into the box the same way that

952
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:51,255
Speaker 9:  they did before, but if something happens to the editor

953
00:58:51,925 --> 00:58:53,975
Speaker 9:  just as much as the algorithm, that's a problem.

954
00:58:54,225 --> 00:58:57,615
Speaker 6:  Right. And on the flip side, it that combination of things might make

955
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,825
Speaker 6:  TikTok harder to copy than anything else. Like you,

956
00:59:01,885 --> 00:59:05,545
Speaker 6:  you could sort of peel away each of the pieces that makes it work,

957
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:09,945
Speaker 6:  but as long as it has that collection of things, it's, it's gonna be

958
00:59:10,145 --> 00:59:13,505
Speaker 6:  harder to copy TikTok than it is to just like in theory all you need is a

959
00:59:13,505 --> 00:59:17,305
Speaker 6:  bunch of people in text boxes and you can beat X at its own game. Like

960
00:59:17,305 --> 00:59:21,085
Speaker 6:  that's essentially what Threads has been trying to do. TikTok has

961
00:59:21,305 --> 00:59:23,625
Speaker 6:  a larger collection of things that are hard to beat.

962
00:59:23,855 --> 00:59:26,585
Speaker 10:  Yeah, there are also just sort of symbiotic

963
00:59:27,585 --> 00:59:31,345
Speaker 10:  businesses like they've tried to move into book publishing based on the

964
00:59:31,345 --> 00:59:35,225
Speaker 10:  popularity of book talk, which is not like a killer app, it's not

965
00:59:35,225 --> 00:59:38,025
Speaker 10:  going to destroy it but it does mean there's just a lot of stuff going on

966
00:59:38,025 --> 00:59:38,225
Speaker 10:  here

967
00:59:38,685 --> 00:59:41,985
Speaker 6:  For sure. Alright, well this is like

968
00:59:42,765 --> 00:59:45,945
Speaker 6:  God help us, we're gonna do this again next week I'm sure, but be before

969
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:49,745
Speaker 6:  we, before we go to a break adding, can we talk about the other Supreme Court

970
00:59:49,745 --> 00:59:53,465
Speaker 6:  thing that happened this week? We can, you spent I would say an unusual amount

971
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:57,065
Speaker 6:  of your week listening to Supreme Court live streams like this is not like

972
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:58,985
Speaker 6:  a normal thing you spend most of your time doing.

973
00:59:59,765 --> 01:00:03,105
Speaker 10:  The court is definitely Sunday before a group project mode right now.

974
01:00:04,815 --> 01:00:08,745
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So okay so it was, this was the the porn trial. Can you explain what's

975
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:09,105
Speaker 6:  going on here?

976
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,865
Speaker 10:  Alright, so this is the trial called Free Speech Coalition v Paxton

977
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:16,025
Speaker 10:  and the idea is that Texas passed this

978
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:20,145
Speaker 10:  law that's very similar to a lot of other state laws that says that if a

979
01:00:20,145 --> 01:00:23,345
Speaker 10:  site has a more than a third adult content,

980
01:00:24,575 --> 01:00:28,385
Speaker 10:  then it needs to age gate its platform in a way that is

981
01:00:28,535 --> 01:00:32,265
Speaker 10:  more rigorous than like clicking a box that says I'm 18. And in

982
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,665
Speaker 10:  Texas's case it also has to put up these warnings that

983
01:00:36,055 --> 01:00:39,785
Speaker 10:  porn destroys your health, which is not scientifically

984
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:43,385
Speaker 10:  proven that causes addiction and harms minors and all that.

985
01:00:43,525 --> 01:00:43,945
Speaker 10:  That's

986
01:00:43,945 --> 01:00:45,985
Speaker 6:  Just a thing you can say If you want to I guess. Sure.

987
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:50,585
Speaker 10:  So this was then taken up to the court, a district court blocked

988
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:53,865
Speaker 10:  it said look, there are all kinds of problems with making people hand over

989
01:00:54,265 --> 01:00:57,985
Speaker 10:  identifying information before they go and look at sensitive

990
01:00:58,215 --> 01:01:01,945
Speaker 10:  content, especially during a period where Texas is say

991
01:01:01,945 --> 01:01:05,825
Speaker 10:  cracking down on LGBT people and then the

992
01:01:05,825 --> 01:01:09,665
Speaker 10:  fifth circuit, which is where law goes to die, said, no this

993
01:01:09,665 --> 01:01:13,345
Speaker 10:  is fine. We're gonna apply just the lowest standard for considering

994
01:01:13,345 --> 01:01:16,865
Speaker 10:  speech, not literally the lowest standard but an unusually low standard

995
01:01:17,725 --> 01:01:21,385
Speaker 10:  for considering whether this is going to chill speech,

996
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:24,465
Speaker 10:  which means okay we're good, let this happen. It happened

997
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:29,515
Speaker 10:  and then after that it is gone to the Supreme Court. It was

998
01:01:29,515 --> 01:01:33,075
Speaker 10:  argued yesterday, it is probably not even remotely close to over

999
01:01:33,495 --> 01:01:37,435
Speaker 10:  but we got a pretty broad section of questions about

1000
01:01:37,435 --> 01:01:37,555
Speaker 10:  it.

1001
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:41,315
Speaker 6:  So what is the free speech argument here? I think age verification is the

1002
01:01:41,315 --> 01:01:44,315
Speaker 6:  kind of thing that has come up a bunch of different times in a bunch of different,

1003
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:49,315
Speaker 6:  you know, cases around the the legal world recently. But why

1004
01:01:49,315 --> 01:01:51,795
Speaker 6:  is this a free speech debate at all? So

1005
01:01:51,865 --> 01:01:55,715
Speaker 10:  This has come up a few times. It has primarily during the

1006
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:59,545
Speaker 10:  late nineties and early aughts, which is that If

1007
01:01:59,805 --> 01:02:03,425
Speaker 10:  you put a burden on people to access

1008
01:02:03,425 --> 01:02:07,345
Speaker 10:  something that is speech related, that burden has to have a compelling interest

1009
01:02:07,445 --> 01:02:11,305
Speaker 10:  and it has to be sort of the, the thing that's really

1010
01:02:11,445 --> 01:02:15,145
Speaker 10:  the best solution that there can't be a sort of more narrow,

1011
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:19,205
Speaker 10:  less onerous system. And a lot lot of

1012
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:22,525
Speaker 10:  the argument for making age verification

1013
01:02:22,545 --> 01:02:26,325
Speaker 10:  unconstitutional is first of all it's just a barrier to access speech

1014
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:30,685
Speaker 10:  for children and adults alike. It adds this process to get

1015
01:02:30,685 --> 01:02:33,685
Speaker 10:  to something that is legal and that is protected by the First Amendment.

1016
01:02:34,065 --> 01:02:38,005
Speaker 10:  The other issue is there really has never been an age verification

1017
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:41,765
Speaker 10:  system that is both rigorous enough that it's not trivial to

1018
01:02:41,765 --> 01:02:45,725
Speaker 10:  circumvent and not producing something that creates

1019
01:02:45,965 --> 01:02:49,685
Speaker 10:  a pretty significant security and privacy risk. Right? So

1020
01:02:49,845 --> 01:02:53,125
Speaker 6:  I feel like the one end of that spectrum is like the the things on the alcohol

1021
01:02:53,155 --> 01:02:56,365
Speaker 6:  webpage where they're just like enter your birthday and you just enter like

1022
01:02:56,485 --> 01:03:00,125
Speaker 6:  I was born in 1931 and it's like terrific and lets you in,

1023
01:03:00,435 --> 01:03:03,885
Speaker 6:  it's like we have, we have satisfied something here but we're not actually

1024
01:03:03,885 --> 01:03:07,245
Speaker 6:  accomplishing anything all the way to the flip side of like you can make

1025
01:03:07,245 --> 01:03:10,565
Speaker 6:  these things very secure but then they cause all kinds of other problems,

1026
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:14,805
Speaker 10:  Right? The sort of worst case scenario is you put your

1027
01:03:14,975 --> 01:03:18,885
Speaker 10:  government issued ID into a system and it permanently

1028
01:03:18,935 --> 01:03:22,765
Speaker 10:  links you with a something that you don't want people to see and then a

1029
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,565
Speaker 6:  List of all the porn you watch, you mean? Yeah.

1030
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:28,645
Speaker 10:  And then everything gets hacked and then the exact details of

1031
01:03:28,755 --> 01:03:32,725
Speaker 10:  your viewing of adult video is out there for everyone to see. This is not

1032
01:03:33,005 --> 01:03:36,085
Speaker 10:  how most age verification systems work at this point. They have added in

1033
01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:38,685
Speaker 10:  more safeguards but we still don't have

1034
01:03:40,185 --> 01:03:43,705
Speaker 10:  a really great solution. And anyway, back to

1035
01:03:43,845 --> 01:03:47,585
Speaker 10:  20 years ago, the thing they determined at that point was the internet as

1036
01:03:47,585 --> 01:03:51,265
Speaker 10:  it stands then you just, you have the better

1037
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:54,625
Speaker 10:  option of content filtering that it is possible for you to

1038
01:03:55,055 --> 01:03:58,785
Speaker 10:  prevent children from accessing porn on your computer by

1039
01:03:58,785 --> 01:04:02,465
Speaker 10:  putting a filter on it. And that means we are not going to go

1040
01:04:02,535 --> 01:04:06,505
Speaker 10:  this extra higher step of burdening everybody including adults

1041
01:04:06,935 --> 01:04:10,865
Speaker 10:  with a system that creates privacy and security risks and now it's been

1042
01:04:10,985 --> 01:04:12,385
Speaker 10:  20 years and we're considering this again.

1043
01:04:12,605 --> 01:04:16,275
Speaker 6:  So is the question now, does that still

1044
01:04:16,545 --> 01:04:19,155
Speaker 6:  work? Like is that still the right approach, the content filtering thing?

1045
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:22,315
Speaker 6:  Like is that, is that again the question, is that a better way the,

1046
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:26,555
Speaker 10:  The question before the Supreme Court at this point was actually what standard

1047
01:04:26,615 --> 01:04:30,475
Speaker 10:  do you apply to evaluate whether this chill speech which

1048
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:32,235
Speaker 10:  is known as scrutiny, it's

1049
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,275
Speaker 6:  One of those of those where they're like, we're not even arguing the case,

1050
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:37,435
Speaker 6:  we're just arguing the case about the case and it's just like we're just

1051
01:04:37,435 --> 01:04:38,675
Speaker 6:  gonna lawyer it all the way down.

1052
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:43,565
Speaker 10:  It's kind of a little bit in between, which is that? Yeah, that's the question

1053
01:04:43,785 --> 01:04:47,565
Speaker 10:  is whether we send this back and say you have to decide this based on

1054
01:04:47,725 --> 01:04:51,245
Speaker 10:  a different standard. But there were also a lot of questions that were about

1055
01:04:51,245 --> 01:04:54,085
Speaker 10:  the broader issue of, alright well has the internet changed?

1056
01:04:55,105 --> 01:04:58,565
Speaker 10:  Do has age verification changed? Is there a compelling enough

1057
01:04:59,005 --> 01:05:02,845
Speaker 10:  interest in protecting children from adult content that

1058
01:05:02,845 --> 01:05:06,685
Speaker 10:  we should reconsider this? It was, it was a hearing that

1059
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:10,885
Speaker 10:  I think doesn't necessarily provide a clear picture of what's gonna happen

1060
01:05:10,915 --> 01:05:11,205
Speaker 10:  next.

1061
01:05:11,555 --> 01:05:15,485
Speaker 6:  Well that sounds like every tech related hearing anyone has had in the

1062
01:05:15,485 --> 01:05:18,445
Speaker 6:  last several years. So I'm glad we're making a lot of progress in just kind

1063
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:21,605
Speaker 6:  of arguing around the edges without actually talking about the real things

1064
01:05:21,605 --> 01:05:22,405
Speaker 6:  going on for people

1065
01:05:22,595 --> 01:05:26,165
Speaker 10:  With the exception of TikTok, which after that everyone was like, oh TikTok,

1066
01:05:26,165 --> 01:05:27,085
Speaker 10:  TikTok is screwed.

1067
01:05:27,405 --> 01:05:31,245
Speaker 6:  That's fair. That is, that is very fair. So you actually make

1068
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:34,245
Speaker 6:  the case that these two cases are somewhat connected to each other that you

1069
01:05:34,245 --> 01:05:37,925
Speaker 6:  can kind of draw a line between the, the porn hub hearing and the TikTok

1070
01:05:37,925 --> 01:05:39,565
Speaker 6:  hearing. Can you, can you explain the connection there?

1071
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:43,565
Speaker 10:  I think this is not necessarily the biggest issue in either of these, but

1072
01:05:43,585 --> 01:05:47,565
Speaker 10:  in both cases what you're doing is pitting two government interests

1073
01:05:47,565 --> 01:05:50,885
Speaker 10:  against each other. In TikTok you've got, there is this national security

1074
01:05:50,995 --> 01:05:54,805
Speaker 10:  risk, the Chinese government could harvest everybody's data

1075
01:05:55,025 --> 01:05:58,885
Speaker 10:  or push covert propaganda and we're going to pit this

1076
01:05:58,885 --> 01:06:02,805
Speaker 10:  against the speech rights of a company that operates

1077
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:06,205
Speaker 10:  in the United States and a bunch of people who are using that platform for

1078
01:06:06,205 --> 01:06:09,605
Speaker 10:  speech. So it's national security versus speech.

1079
01:06:10,275 --> 01:06:14,245
Speaker 10:  Then in FSCV Paxton you've got

1080
01:06:14,245 --> 01:06:17,925
Speaker 10:  this issue of, alright, there is a compelling state interest in protecting

1081
01:06:17,925 --> 01:06:21,845
Speaker 10:  miners. If you run a store, you can't sell

1082
01:06:21,915 --> 01:06:25,725
Speaker 10:  Playboy to a minor in like a brick and mortar outlet.

1083
01:06:26,075 --> 01:06:29,365
Speaker 10:  Okay, we're gonna try to apply the same thing to the internet because there

1084
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:32,605
Speaker 10:  is just such a clear risk for minors accessing

1085
01:06:33,335 --> 01:06:37,085
Speaker 10:  adult content and we're gonna weigh that against everybody

1086
01:06:37,225 --> 01:06:37,965
Speaker 10:  else's rights.

1087
01:06:38,305 --> 01:06:42,085
Speaker 6:  As we've talked about so many times in this show, we're at a moment politically

1088
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:45,945
Speaker 6:  where it feels like If you want to get any kind of broad agreement

1089
01:06:45,945 --> 01:06:49,065
Speaker 6:  about technology, you have to either yell about children or yell about China.

1090
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:52,385
Speaker 6:  And it's very funny that we are just kind of simultaneously doing both of

1091
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:55,865
Speaker 6:  those things in the Supreme Court right now. It just feels like we've, we've

1092
01:06:55,865 --> 01:06:56,785
Speaker 6:  hit a nexus of something.

1093
01:06:57,225 --> 01:07:00,745
Speaker 10:  Children in the national security are Yeah, clear the classic

1094
01:07:01,245 --> 01:07:05,025
Speaker 10:  we are going to change speech law. Yeah, I think we're also just at a moment

1095
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:08,345
Speaker 10:  where the First amendment has just produced a lot of side effects that make

1096
01:07:08,345 --> 01:07:11,825
Speaker 10:  everybody mad and a lot of them are legitimately really

1097
01:07:12,185 --> 01:07:16,065
Speaker 10:  frustrating. And so there's this sort of, if the law you

1098
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:19,825
Speaker 10:  made led you here what uses the law idea going around,

1099
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:20,425
Speaker 10:  right?

1100
01:07:20,565 --> 01:07:22,945
Speaker 6:  And and yeah, and it is, I mean and and you've, you've written about this

1101
01:07:23,025 --> 01:07:26,145
Speaker 6:  a few times that the, the question underneath all of it is like

1102
01:07:27,005 --> 01:07:30,145
Speaker 6:  how important is the first amendment right? And it's like are we, are we

1103
01:07:30,145 --> 01:07:34,065
Speaker 6:  ready to start tearing it down piece by piece in

1104
01:07:34,065 --> 01:07:37,505
Speaker 6:  order to solve some of these other problems or is the first amendment worth

1105
01:07:37,505 --> 01:07:38,345
Speaker 6:  these other problems?

1106
01:07:38,565 --> 01:07:40,985
Speaker 10:  And we're looking at Europe right now, which is passing a bunch of tech

1107
01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:44,585
Speaker 10:  regulation and obviously has a different speech framework and there are

1108
01:07:44,585 --> 01:07:48,465
Speaker 10:  things there that I think that I would say have not worked out great

1109
01:07:49,085 --> 01:07:52,305
Speaker 10:  but we're also looking at this and saying the internet could be different

1110
01:07:52,325 --> 01:07:54,225
Speaker 10:  and I think there are people for whom that's appealing

1111
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:58,465
Speaker 6:  Fair. So I think we have a pretty clear sense of how

1112
01:07:58,465 --> 01:08:02,345
Speaker 6:  the Supreme Court was leaning with the TikTok stuff. We're still infuriatingly

1113
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:05,585
Speaker 6:  waiting on them to issue some actual information. But I feel like everybody

1114
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:09,545
Speaker 6:  came outta that hearing pretty aligned on where it seemed like the,

1115
01:08:09,565 --> 01:08:12,985
Speaker 6:  the winds were blowing. What's your sense with the the PornHub stuff?

1116
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:16,445
Speaker 10:  I really don't know. We talked to several people and they were like, we

1117
01:08:16,445 --> 01:08:20,365
Speaker 10:  really don't necessarily know. Interesting. I do think that, so one of

1118
01:08:20,365 --> 01:08:24,125
Speaker 10:  the things that came out of this was this quote everybody kind of dunked

1119
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:28,085
Speaker 10:  on, which was that Justice Alito says alright so one of the covered

1120
01:08:28,485 --> 01:08:32,005
Speaker 10:  companies here is PornHub, right? Or one of the covered platforms. Alright

1121
01:08:32,105 --> 01:08:36,085
Speaker 10:  so If you go on PornHub, do you have essays on there? Do you have

1122
01:08:36,105 --> 01:08:39,805
Speaker 10:  the equivalent of Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley Jr. And everyone was

1123
01:08:39,805 --> 01:08:42,885
Speaker 10:  like, Alito, what are you doing? Do you have any idea how PornHub works?

1124
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:46,925
Speaker 10:  And I think that was actually, I think that's the wrong read of it.

1125
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:50,245
Speaker 10:  I think that maybe I am wrong on this but I don't think really for a minute

1126
01:08:50,275 --> 01:08:53,125
Speaker 10:  that he genuinely thinks this thing is

1127
01:08:54,775 --> 01:08:58,035
Speaker 10:  has a bunch of intellectual value and I think there was just this really

1128
01:08:58,035 --> 01:09:01,835
Speaker 10:  running through line of we are going to prove that anything that is

1129
01:09:01,835 --> 01:09:05,715
Speaker 10:  porn on the internet is worthless and that it should not have speech protections.

1130
01:09:05,735 --> 01:09:09,515
Speaker 10:  It is obviously just harmful, harmful to kids. You're making this argument

1131
01:09:09,585 --> 01:09:13,195
Speaker 10:  that it's going to hurt sexual health sites or

1132
01:09:13,305 --> 01:09:17,035
Speaker 10:  educational content or things that aren't artistic and no

1133
01:09:17,035 --> 01:09:18,755
Speaker 10:  we're saying no it doesn't have Gore. Al

1134
01:09:19,275 --> 01:09:23,075
Speaker 6:  I read PornHub for the articles is really, it's like that was your, you put

1135
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,915
Speaker 6:  that in in one of the stories and it is the best sentence that has been on

1136
01:09:25,915 --> 01:09:27,795
Speaker 6:  the verse.com this week. I was very proud of that moment.

1137
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:31,795
Speaker 10:  And there is they, the lawyer did raise the point that there is like sexual

1138
01:09:31,795 --> 01:09:35,195
Speaker 10:  health content. There is funnily enough a woman whose deal is that she just

1139
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:39,155
Speaker 10:  does video essays and like teaches things and

1140
01:09:39,325 --> 01:09:40,155
Speaker 10:  makes money off it.

1141
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:42,075
Speaker 6:  Apparently the rev share on PornHub is very good.

1142
01:09:42,665 --> 01:09:42,955
Speaker 10:  Yeah,

1143
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:46,035
Speaker 6:  The economics, maybe that's where TikTok will go. Go, go do that.

1144
01:09:46,225 --> 01:09:50,155
Speaker 6:  pornhub.com/tiktok make it happen. So this could do it.

1145
01:09:50,945 --> 01:09:54,875
Speaker 6:  Richard, what do you think about PornHub just in general? What are your

1146
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:55,115
Speaker 6:  thoughts?

1147
01:09:55,415 --> 01:09:58,955
Speaker 9:  I'm gonna talk about free speech and an app that you can use

1148
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:02,075
Speaker 9:  where you can see what it's like without the first amendment. It's called

1149
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:04,955
Speaker 9:  Yahoo Shoe. You should try it out.

1150
01:10:06,475 --> 01:10:08,835
Speaker 9:  A lot of people on there who can do can talk to you about the Constitution,

1151
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,875
Speaker 9:  why they don't use it.

1152
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:13,915
Speaker 6:  Yeah, say hello to your Chinese spy while you're there. Alright, we gotta

1153
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:16,995
Speaker 6:  take one more break. Addie, thank you for joining us Richard. We're gonna

1154
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:19,755
Speaker 6:  come back and we're gonna blow through some news because holy God is there

1155
01:10:19,755 --> 01:10:21,755
Speaker 6:  a lot going on this week. We'll be right back.

1156
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:36,555
Speaker 6:  All right, we're back. There's more policy stuff. Let me just

1157
01:13:36,555 --> 01:13:40,235
Speaker 6:  read you some headlines. Joe Biden signs, executive orders speed AI data

1158
01:13:40,235 --> 01:13:44,075
Speaker 6:  center reconstruction, US finalizes rule to effectively ban

1159
01:13:44,075 --> 01:13:47,995
Speaker 6:  Chinese vehicles, FTCs Sues John Deere, which is not a sentence I expected

1160
01:13:48,015 --> 01:13:51,795
Speaker 6:  to read this week. There's some DJ I stuff

1161
01:13:51,815 --> 01:13:55,395
Speaker 6:  and controversy going on. I don't wanna talk about policy and politics anymore.

1162
01:13:55,395 --> 01:13:58,075
Speaker 6:  There's like, there's a lot of this to come for the next few weeks.

1163
01:13:59,105 --> 01:14:01,915
Speaker 6:  Richard, do you care about any of that at this moment or can we just like

1164
01:14:01,915 --> 01:14:05,675
Speaker 6:  move on to more fun gadgety things? Remember drones just, just saying remember

1165
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:08,995
Speaker 6:  drones, remember drones? I feel the same way about drones in 3D printers

1166
01:14:08,995 --> 01:14:12,270
Speaker 6:  where like for years everybody was like, everybody's gonna have one of these.

1167
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:15,805
Speaker 6:  And it's like, probably not though. Seems unlikely. I was at CES and there

1168
01:14:15,805 --> 01:14:18,965
Speaker 6:  were a bunch of people who were like, it's time for the the second coming

1169
01:14:18,985 --> 01:14:22,805
Speaker 6:  of the at-home 3D printer for mainstream users. And I was like, okay,

1170
01:14:23,395 --> 01:14:26,125
Speaker 6:  best of luck with that friends. And they're, the thing they were showing

1171
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:29,965
Speaker 6:  off was like six feet tall and like $4,000 and I was like,

1172
01:14:30,005 --> 01:14:33,645
Speaker 6:  I don't think this is the one y'all. But anyway, all right, let's talk about

1173
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:37,285
Speaker 6:  Sonos because I actually think in the, in the gadget world,

1174
01:14:37,955 --> 01:14:41,825
Speaker 6:  this was probably the biggest and both most

1175
01:14:41,825 --> 01:14:44,505
Speaker 6:  surprising and most unsurprising thing that happened this week. What happened

1176
01:14:44,505 --> 01:14:44,985
Speaker 6:  this week? Richard,

1177
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:49,635
Speaker 9:  Their CEO stepped down and some other executives left

1178
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:53,315
Speaker 6:  Full house cleaning at Sonos. Basically. Yeah, like

1179
01:14:53,315 --> 01:14:56,755
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it turns out that releasing an app update that doesn't work when your

1180
01:14:56,755 --> 01:15:00,155
Speaker 9:  whole thing is giving people a system that works when they want it to work

1181
01:15:00,795 --> 01:15:04,035
Speaker 9:  is bad and means that a lot of the leaders of your company have to leave.

1182
01:15:04,225 --> 01:15:07,795
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So, okay, so Patrick Spence, the CEO is out

1183
01:15:08,975 --> 01:15:12,675
Speaker 6:  Tom Conrad who is, I would argue one of the most sort of quietly

1184
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:16,755
Speaker 6:  fascinating people in tech. He has just been like at every weird inflection

1185
01:15:16,755 --> 01:15:19,715
Speaker 6:  point in the tech industry over the years. Can I just quickly read you a

1186
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:23,155
Speaker 6:  list of some of the places that Tom Conrad has worked over the years? Hit

1187
01:15:23,155 --> 01:15:27,035
Speaker 6:  me. He was at Pandora for 10 years in the middle of like

1188
01:15:27,035 --> 01:15:30,635
Speaker 6:  the crazy online music revolution. He was the VP of product at Snapchat.

1189
01:15:30,855 --> 01:15:34,635
Speaker 6:  He was the chief product officer at Quibi for all of qui

1190
01:15:34,695 --> 01:15:38,595
Speaker 6:  B's life. Yeah, quibi, everybody's favorite number one streaming service

1191
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:43,635
Speaker 6:  and now was the director of the board at Sonos for a

1192
01:15:43,635 --> 01:15:47,555
Speaker 6:  while and is now the interim CEO. But according to like the

1193
01:15:47,565 --> 01:15:50,715
Speaker 6:  memos we've seen and the changes that are being made sure seems like he is

1194
01:15:50,715 --> 01:15:54,315
Speaker 6:  not acting like an interim CEO. So Tom Conrad, just like

1195
01:15:55,335 --> 01:15:59,275
Speaker 6:  guy around the tech industry when weird things are happening. Very interesting.

1196
01:15:59,425 --> 01:15:59,955
Speaker 6:  Real Jeff

1197
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:00,995
Speaker 9:  Teague of tech execs.

1198
01:16:01,785 --> 01:16:05,755
Speaker 6:  It's exactly right. Who knows if he's as good a podcaster as

1199
01:16:05,755 --> 01:16:08,635
Speaker 6:  Jeff Teague though Tom Conrad, If you ever wanna come to The Vergecast and

1200
01:16:08,635 --> 01:16:11,955
Speaker 6:  tell war stories about your time in the NBA, let us know we're ready.

1201
01:16:13,055 --> 01:16:16,675
Speaker 6:  But yeah, so the, the chief product officer also leaving, I think the chief

1202
01:16:16,675 --> 01:16:19,635
Speaker 6:  commercial officer I believe was her title, also leaving the company

1203
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,825
Speaker 6:  Big huge changes at Sonos.

1204
01:16:24,775 --> 01:16:28,685
Speaker 6:  This feels both like maybe the right thing given what

1205
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:32,485
Speaker 6:  has happened to Sonos, but also like not a good sign that

1206
01:16:32,515 --> 01:16:36,445
Speaker 6:  this company is like, it's one thing to say we made a mistake. I think

1207
01:16:36,445 --> 01:16:39,645
Speaker 6:  it's, it's pretty obvious now that Sonos got kind of way out over its skis.

1208
01:16:39,645 --> 01:16:42,885
Speaker 6:  They were like, we need new things to do and new ways to make money as a

1209
01:16:42,885 --> 01:16:45,205
Speaker 6:  public company. So they decided to make headphones and they were like, we're

1210
01:16:45,205 --> 01:16:48,765
Speaker 6:  gonna get into the TV space and had all these big ideas about expansions

1211
01:16:48,765 --> 01:16:50,965
Speaker 6:  when actually what they should have done is just kept making really good

1212
01:16:50,965 --> 01:16:54,935
Speaker 6:  speakers that people liked. And you can see how

1213
01:16:55,595 --> 01:16:59,295
Speaker 6:  the next thing to do is kind of retrench, but I think in many cases

1214
01:16:59,475 --> 01:17:03,255
Speaker 6:  you can do that without turning over

1215
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:07,215
Speaker 6:  all of the leadership of your company. And this just seems

1216
01:17:07,215 --> 01:17:11,205
Speaker 6:  like not a great sign for what is happening and what

1217
01:17:11,205 --> 01:17:13,285
Speaker 6:  is maybe to come from Sonos at this point.

1218
01:17:13,505 --> 01:17:17,085
Speaker 9:  It feels like it usually doesn't work out well. But yeah, so they, they had

1219
01:17:17,085 --> 01:17:20,085
Speaker 9:  to get those headphones out, just had to release these Sonos the headphones,

1220
01:17:20,085 --> 01:17:23,765
Speaker 9:  so they kinda had to change all of their technology. And I mean, as I understand,

1221
01:17:23,785 --> 01:17:27,365
Speaker 9:  I'm one of the few people I think who doesn't own a Sonos system, but it's

1222
01:17:27,365 --> 01:17:30,645
Speaker 9:  always seemed like Sono sells multi-room audio that costs a little too much,

1223
01:17:30,865 --> 01:17:33,165
Speaker 9:  but it works. Yeah. Is that that? No,

1224
01:17:33,165 --> 01:17:36,765
Speaker 6:  I think that's exactly right. And for years it was the only thing like it

1225
01:17:36,835 --> 01:17:40,245
Speaker 6:  that it was like, it was, it was too expensive probably by,

1226
01:17:41,045 --> 01:17:43,765
Speaker 6:  I don't know, 40 or 50%, right? It was like you could get, you could get

1227
01:17:43,805 --> 01:17:47,645
Speaker 6:  a speaker that sounded just as good for somewhere in the range of half

1228
01:17:47,645 --> 01:17:50,565
Speaker 6:  the price, but then If you wanted a bunch of them and you wanted it to make

1229
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:53,805
Speaker 6:  sense and work with the apps that you used, there just wasn't anything like

1230
01:17:53,805 --> 01:17:57,565
Speaker 6:  it. And then Google started building a system like it and then they got

1231
01:17:57,565 --> 01:18:01,205
Speaker 6:  into that whole lawsuit about it and you know, Amazon's audio systems got

1232
01:18:01,205 --> 01:18:05,005
Speaker 6:  better and then you, you can just like cast audio around and like Bluetooth

1233
01:18:05,005 --> 01:18:08,765
Speaker 6:  speakers work fine. And so we're, we're at a point now where the idea

1234
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:13,045
Speaker 6:  of w Sonos is basic thing I think is a

1235
01:18:13,045 --> 01:18:16,885
Speaker 6:  little less special than it once was. But still

1236
01:18:17,535 --> 01:18:21,005
Speaker 6:  until this app fiasco Sonos was still better at this than everybody else.

1237
01:18:21,505 --> 01:18:25,365
Speaker 6:  And it feels like over the last 12 months in,

1238
01:18:25,385 --> 01:18:29,045
Speaker 6:  in order to ship headphones that I never, ever hear anyone talk about and

1239
01:18:29,045 --> 01:18:32,965
Speaker 6:  have never once seen in the wild, just burned all

1240
01:18:32,965 --> 01:18:36,125
Speaker 6:  of its goodwill. And I think I'm at the point now where like I, I wouldn't

1241
01:18:36,565 --> 01:18:40,365
Speaker 6:  consider Sonos to be the thing that just works, even though like my SOO system

1242
01:18:40,365 --> 01:18:43,605
Speaker 6:  still works great, I have zero problems with it. I never used the Sonos app,

1243
01:18:43,695 --> 01:18:47,165
Speaker 6:  which is I think part of it, but like it

1244
01:18:47,455 --> 01:18:50,365
Speaker 6:  we're sort of at a point both where with all this product stuff and now with

1245
01:18:50,365 --> 01:18:53,605
Speaker 6:  all of this change, it's like I Sonos feels unstable like

1246
01:18:54,225 --> 01:18:58,075
Speaker 6:  existentially in a way that I think is sometimes very hard to come back

1247
01:18:58,075 --> 01:18:58,595
Speaker 6:  from. I

1248
01:18:58,675 --> 01:19:02,475
Speaker 9:  I think that the takeaway that I'm, I'm getting from this is that that

1249
01:19:02,475 --> 01:19:05,315
Speaker 9:  reputation is something that's, that's worth a lot to people. That that's

1250
01:19:05,315 --> 01:19:08,395
Speaker 9:  what people were paying for is that they, they knew Sonos was the one that

1251
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:11,635
Speaker 9:  they could buy and it would probably work pretty well and if it didn't work,

1252
01:19:11,635 --> 01:19:14,755
Speaker 9:  you know, you could probably be get somebody to make it work for you. And

1253
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:17,475
Speaker 9:  so of these other tech companies, yeah, I mean, okay, so Google's getting

1254
01:19:17,475 --> 01:19:21,195
Speaker 9:  into Multiroom audio, apple is sort of in in

1255
01:19:21,195 --> 01:19:24,235
Speaker 9:  speakers, but neither of them were very serious about it. It's just a side

1256
01:19:24,435 --> 01:19:27,155
Speaker 9:  business for them. Person Sonos, it's their business. They care, they wanna

1257
01:19:27,155 --> 01:19:31,105
Speaker 9:  make it, they wanna make the experience good for you. But then they, they

1258
01:19:31,165 --> 01:19:34,145
Speaker 9:  it, it was the one thing, it was the one thing that they had that their competitors

1259
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:38,065
Speaker 9:  really couldn't buy even with all of their tech billions and they seem

1260
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:38,745
Speaker 9:  to have squandered it.

1261
01:19:39,215 --> 01:19:43,105
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I I I completely agree and I think it's, it's

1262
01:19:43,155 --> 01:19:47,025
Speaker 6:  maybe not impossible to get it back, but it's gonna take a lot of work and

1263
01:19:47,025 --> 01:19:50,905
Speaker 6:  there are a lot of like long time Sonos users. One of the things that

1264
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,745
Speaker 6:  Sonos had going for it, like the company's greatest problem was

1265
01:19:54,845 --> 01:19:58,425
Speaker 6:  nobody needed to upgrade their Sonos stuff because it was so good. And I

1266
01:19:58,425 --> 01:20:02,385
Speaker 6:  think there are a lot of people now who are feeling pretty burned by that

1267
01:20:02,385 --> 01:20:05,945
Speaker 6:  relationship and getting that back is gonna be a real challenge.

1268
01:20:06,485 --> 01:20:10,285
Speaker 6:  Anyway, this is a lightning round as you can tell already. We're going

1269
01:20:10,285 --> 01:20:14,205
Speaker 6:  very quickly through this. Let's do a few more. We got some information

1270
01:20:14,205 --> 01:20:17,565
Speaker 6:  about the, the supposed slim iPhone 17,

1271
01:20:18,415 --> 01:20:22,165
Speaker 6:  which might be called the iPhone 17 air. Richard, I hate this.

1272
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:25,385
Speaker 6:  I hate it. That's it, that's all I have to tell you.

1273
01:20:26,105 --> 01:20:29,185
Speaker 9:  Speaking of companies that are very successful and need to build a new product

1274
01:20:29,285 --> 01:20:32,825
Speaker 9:  for some reason to sell something else, here comes a slim iPhone that you

1275
01:20:32,825 --> 01:20:35,945
Speaker 9:  didn't ask for. I think some of the rumors have have been that this could

1276
01:20:35,945 --> 01:20:39,845
Speaker 9:  replace the, the plus model that those big but still

1277
01:20:39,845 --> 01:20:43,245
Speaker 9:  with the lower specs. So I think based on the rumors that we've heard is

1278
01:20:43,245 --> 01:20:46,725
Speaker 9:  that this is something that would be, have a design that looks a lot different

1279
01:20:46,795 --> 01:20:50,045
Speaker 9:  than the current iPhone than, you know, the regular iPhones and iPhone pros.

1280
01:20:51,065 --> 01:20:54,565
Speaker 9:  It maybe wouldn't have quite as high of the specs as the pro,

1281
01:20:55,065 --> 01:20:58,285
Speaker 9:  but it would probably be more expensive. It'll be very slim when you, when

1282
01:20:58,285 --> 01:21:01,445
Speaker 9:  you take it outta your pocket and you're somewhere people will know you've

1283
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:04,285
Speaker 9:  got the, the iPhone air. If that's, if that's the name,

1284
01:21:05,555 --> 01:21:08,405
Speaker 9:  it's something that they can do. It's, it's something new. And and I think

1285
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:12,205
Speaker 9:  that's a, a real issue for Apple and for really these other

1286
01:21:12,405 --> 01:21:15,885
Speaker 9:  companies and also Samsung who is rumored to be about to debut a slim phone

1287
01:21:16,385 --> 01:21:18,925
Speaker 9:  as well because of course if I, if Apple has one, so will Samsung,

1288
01:21:20,265 --> 01:21:23,965
Speaker 9:  how do you sell an iPhone when everyone has an iPhone and the iPhone that

1289
01:21:23,965 --> 01:21:25,965
Speaker 9:  they have is pretty good. Apple intelligence

1290
01:25:19,835 --> 01:25:22,675
Speaker 6:  platform. So you can just like Google a show and click on it on Google and

1291
01:25:22,675 --> 01:25:24,395
Speaker 6:  start watching the show, which I think is a

1292
01:25:24,395 --> 01:25:27,115
Speaker 9:  And most that happens a surprising amount with things that I want to watch.

1293
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:29,875
Speaker 9:  It turns out they're on Tubby just, they're like, yeah, you could watch it

1294
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,515
Speaker 9:  for free right now. Oh yeah, thanks.

1295
01:25:32,205 --> 01:25:35,355
Speaker 6:  Toy's Library. If you, If you think kind of like

1296
01:25:36,235 --> 01:25:39,995
Speaker 6:  B list shows and Below Tuby has as good a library

1297
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:44,275
Speaker 6:  as anybody and especially like if, If you really love like

1298
01:25:44,645 --> 01:25:48,275
Speaker 6:  three generations ago, like the, the shows our parents grew up watching

1299
01:25:48,535 --> 01:25:50,155
Speaker 6:  are like all over Tuby. They're,

1300
01:25:50,155 --> 01:25:52,915
Speaker 9:  They're there the ones that you think are nowhere, turns out they have them.

1301
01:25:53,835 --> 01:25:56,475
Speaker 9:  There was this movie that I saw the other day, baby Assassins, it's on Tub

1302
01:25:56,475 --> 01:26:00,315
Speaker 9:  Beat. It's great Japanese movie If you love action. Good. I

1303
01:26:00,395 --> 01:26:02,035
Speaker 9:  I did not watch it on Tub Beat, but it is there.

1304
01:26:02,345 --> 01:26:06,185
Speaker 6:  Totally. And I should say I actually, I got one thing wrong. You

1305
01:26:06,185 --> 01:26:10,035
Speaker 6:  will need an account to watch the Super Bowl on Tubi. I just, I I

1306
01:26:10,035 --> 01:26:13,235
Speaker 6:  just caught this looking this up right now. Okay. Which is very interesting

1307
01:26:13,235 --> 01:26:16,315
Speaker 6:  because part of Tub B's whole thing is that you don't need an account. And

1308
01:26:17,575 --> 01:26:21,555
Speaker 6:  we talked about this a a little bit in a thing we're doing on The Vergecast

1309
01:26:21,815 --> 01:26:25,275
Speaker 6:  on Tuesday about venue, but Fox, which owns Tubi

1310
01:26:25,785 --> 01:26:29,475
Speaker 6:  doesn't have a like premium streaming service of its own. And

1311
01:26:29,615 --> 01:26:33,475
Speaker 6:  one very compelling thing to do when you have the Super Bowl is try and use

1312
01:26:33,475 --> 01:26:36,395
Speaker 6:  it to get people to sign up for your streaming service because it is the

1313
01:26:36,395 --> 01:26:40,115
Speaker 6:  Super Bowl and that's a very good thing to do. So Fox

1314
01:26:40,115 --> 01:26:43,395
Speaker 6:  doesn't have that move. There's no like Fox Plus that they can try to get

1315
01:26:43,395 --> 01:26:45,875
Speaker 6:  you to pay 10 bucks for and then forget about and keep doing like Comcast

1316
01:26:46,055 --> 01:26:49,715
Speaker 6:  can do with NBC and Peacock or CBS can do with

1317
01:26:49,715 --> 01:26:53,555
Speaker 6:  Paramount Plus. So Tubi is the move, but they can't charge you for Tubi.

1318
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:57,635
Speaker 6:  So this is clearly just a, like they're making a big play just to get people

1319
01:26:57,705 --> 01:26:59,315
Speaker 6:  into this ecosystem, which is really

1320
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:02,555
Speaker 9:  Well the last time Fox had the Super Bowl they ran an ad where Tubi took

1321
01:27:02,555 --> 01:27:06,475
Speaker 9:  over the stream and people it like ripped over the, over the screen

1322
01:27:06,475 --> 01:27:08,995
Speaker 9:  and made it seem like you were watching Tubi instead of watching the Super

1323
01:27:08,995 --> 01:27:09,475
Speaker 9:  Bowl. Oh

1324
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:11,355
Speaker 6:  That's right. That's the one where like it was whole thing, the interface

1325
01:27:11,355 --> 01:27:14,475
Speaker 6:  came up right and everybody was like, what is suddenly controlling my smart

1326
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:14,715
Speaker 6:  tv?

1327
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:15,595
Speaker 9:  Yes.

1328
01:27:16,585 --> 01:27:17,275
Speaker 6:  Such a good idea.

1329
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:21,125
Speaker 9:  So they really are using this to, to promote tuby and it's,

1330
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:25,045
Speaker 9:  it's there of course you could use an antenna, which you have I'm

1331
01:27:25,045 --> 01:27:28,405
Speaker 9:  sure, I'm sure you do. I'm sure everyone has an antenna to watch free tv,

1332
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:31,205
Speaker 9:  but If you don't then there's tuby.

1333
01:27:31,835 --> 01:27:35,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah, a antennas are great. I didn't get one for a very long

1334
01:27:35,805 --> 01:27:38,645
Speaker 6:  time 'cause I was like, this is probably complicated. Turns out it's not.

1335
01:27:38,745 --> 01:27:41,445
Speaker 6:  You can buy on on Amazon and set it up in like a minute and a half and it's

1336
01:27:41,445 --> 01:27:45,205
Speaker 6:  a super good idea and it works way better than you think. It's very ugly

1337
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:48,485
Speaker 6:  and you have to stick it to your window most of the time. But works super

1338
01:27:48,485 --> 01:27:51,565
Speaker 6:  well. But also, yeah, I think it's gonna be really interesting to see how

1339
01:27:51,565 --> 01:27:53,805
Speaker 6:  two B does with this because I'm willing to bet that

1340
01:27:55,345 --> 01:27:59,085
Speaker 6:  to be a, a service that is not necessarily known for having like

1341
01:27:59,115 --> 01:28:03,045
Speaker 6:  destination appointment viewing is gonna have

1342
01:28:03,045 --> 01:28:06,805
Speaker 6:  some, some traffic spikes that it has never really reckoned with before

1343
01:28:07,205 --> 01:28:09,765
Speaker 6:  and during that, during the Super Bowl is a bold strategy.

1344
01:28:11,615 --> 01:28:15,585
Speaker 6:  So we'll see. Alright, couple more that we should get to explain to

1345
01:28:15,585 --> 01:28:19,025
Speaker 6:  me what's going on with Drake. I have, I I confess to you, I have avoided

1346
01:28:19,025 --> 01:28:22,305
Speaker 6:  following this thing because it's just a bunch of shenanigans,

1347
01:28:22,925 --> 01:28:26,545
Speaker 6:  but there were new shenanigans this week. What is Drake doing now?

1348
01:28:27,445 --> 01:28:31,385
Speaker 9:  So you may have heard that Kendrick Lamar made a song about Drake last year

1349
01:28:32,085 --> 01:28:35,745
Speaker 9:  in which he accused him of some things that you probably

1350
01:28:35,755 --> 01:28:37,465
Speaker 9:  don't want to be accused of. Kendrick

1351
01:28:37,475 --> 01:28:40,745
Speaker 6:  Lamar won the beef, right? Like we all agree that they were beefing and Kendrick

1352
01:28:40,745 --> 01:28:42,785
Speaker 6:  Lamar sort of resoundingly defeated Drake.

1353
01:28:43,095 --> 01:28:46,905
Speaker 9:  Well Kendrick Lamar was had a free concert in LA where he was dancing

1354
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:50,105
Speaker 9:  on stage with NBA players as they all called Drake a pedophile. So yeah,

1355
01:28:50,145 --> 01:28:51,705
Speaker 9:  I think so I think that is

1356
01:28:51,985 --> 01:28:53,425
Speaker 6:  What winning looks like generally.

1357
01:28:53,865 --> 01:28:57,625
Speaker 9:  Yeah. By, by most definitions. Yeah. But Drake and Kendrick

1358
01:28:57,625 --> 01:29:01,245
Speaker 9:  Lamar are on the same label, universal Music Group and

1359
01:29:01,735 --> 01:29:05,085
Speaker 9:  Drake has turned his eye toward the label,

1360
01:29:06,195 --> 01:29:10,125
Speaker 9:  Spotify to some extent and others. And so he had filed this legal

1361
01:29:10,725 --> 01:29:14,645
Speaker 9:  petition a couple of months ago kind of looking for information, saying and

1362
01:29:14,965 --> 01:29:17,605
Speaker 9:  accusing the label of certain things that they were doing illegal things

1363
01:29:17,605 --> 01:29:20,605
Speaker 9:  to promote the, the Not Like Us song by Kendrick

1364
01:29:21,425 --> 01:29:25,405
Speaker 9:  Pay payola to DJs and people to put it on playlists using

1365
01:29:25,595 --> 01:29:28,525
Speaker 9:  bots to drive up the view numbers on YouTube and the streaming numbers on

1366
01:29:28,525 --> 01:29:32,445
Speaker 9:  Spotify. And so now he has, he pulled one legal petition

1367
01:29:32,475 --> 01:29:35,845
Speaker 9:  that was against UMG and Spotify and filed a federal lawsuit

1368
01:29:36,765 --> 01:29:40,485
Speaker 9:  against UMG saying that the song is defamatory number one,

1369
01:29:40,595 --> 01:29:44,485
Speaker 9:  that it's not true, the accusations in it are not true and

1370
01:29:44,485 --> 01:29:46,925
Speaker 9:  that Universal knows they're not true because otherwise they wouldn't be

1371
01:29:46,925 --> 01:29:49,085
Speaker 9:  in business with him or they could have just called him and asked him if

1372
01:29:49,085 --> 01:29:51,245
Speaker 9:  they're true, which, which he would say that they are not. That's

1373
01:29:51,245 --> 01:29:53,645
Speaker 6:  Quite a phone call. Like, Hey Kendrick's about to put out a song, we have

1374
01:29:53,645 --> 01:29:54,405
Speaker 6:  some questions for you.

1375
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:58,605
Speaker 9:  And accusing them of doing all these things to promote it, claiming that

1376
01:29:58,605 --> 01:30:02,365
Speaker 9:  this was done to kind of affect their negotiations with him on his record

1377
01:30:02,365 --> 01:30:05,605
Speaker 9:  deal and to affect negotiations with Kendrick on his record deal and that

1378
01:30:05,605 --> 01:30:09,165
Speaker 9:  they would have have all of these things. But now, yeah, there is a, a lawsuit

1379
01:30:09,665 --> 01:30:13,565
Speaker 9:  in federal court over a rap beef saying that the song is defamatory, which

1380
01:30:15,015 --> 01:30:18,595
Speaker 9:  If you make a dis track about someone, it probably is defamatory. If it isn't,

1381
01:30:18,595 --> 01:30:19,155
Speaker 9:  you did it wrong.

1382
01:30:21,465 --> 01:30:24,645
Speaker 9:  But, you know, legally I don't know what what that means for, for the future

1383
01:30:24,645 --> 01:30:28,565
Speaker 9:  of this lawsuit. But I find it interesting that he's not, it's not like

1384
01:30:28,565 --> 01:30:32,285
Speaker 9:  he's suing Kendrick or anything he's suing specifically Universal, claiming

1385
01:30:32,285 --> 01:30:35,965
Speaker 9:  that they did all of these, these things that would be probably

1386
01:30:35,965 --> 01:30:39,885
Speaker 9:  illegal to promote the track. Also things that people believe labels do

1387
01:30:39,905 --> 01:30:41,365
Speaker 9:  to promote songs. Yeah.

1388
01:30:41,365 --> 01:30:44,965
Speaker 6:  The idea of like using bots to juice plays and payola and all that stuff

1389
01:30:44,985 --> 01:30:48,885
Speaker 6:  is like, those are the kinds of things that are kind of open secrets

1390
01:30:48,945 --> 01:30:52,765
Speaker 6:  in a lot of parts of the music industry. I I, I have no evidence on this

1391
01:30:52,765 --> 01:30:56,485
Speaker 6:  particular one or UMG or whatever, but like it is a thing that happens and

1392
01:30:56,485 --> 01:30:59,365
Speaker 6:  every people talk about it pretty openly as a thing that happens.

1393
01:30:59,825 --> 01:31:03,205
Speaker 9:  And that is, that is what Drake's lawsuit says. So I guess we're kind of

1394
01:31:03,205 --> 01:31:07,125
Speaker 9:  gonna see where that goes. But curiously, you know, he's not suing

1395
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:10,245
Speaker 9:  Spotify or iHeartRadio who had been named in the previous kind of

1396
01:31:10,855 --> 01:31:14,245
Speaker 9:  thing. Things that he put out, or at least not yet. This is, this lawsuit

1397
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:15,405
Speaker 9:  is just against his like

1398
01:31:16,045 --> 01:31:16,245
Speaker 6:  Interesting

1399
01:31:16,305 --> 01:31:17,485
Speaker 9:  Who he is still signed to.

1400
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:21,045
Speaker 6:  I I would, I would ask you if this was like a Streisand effect thing where

1401
01:31:21,045 --> 01:31:24,685
Speaker 6:  all he was doing was making it bigger, but I feel like Not Like Us Totally,

1402
01:31:24,685 --> 01:31:28,565
Speaker 6:  pretty big does not need help. Yeah, that song that's on is platformed itself

1403
01:31:28,565 --> 01:31:32,365
Speaker 6:  pretty successfully, I would say. Alright, one

1404
01:31:32,365 --> 01:31:36,285
Speaker 6:  more and then we're gonna get outta here. Blue Origin,

1405
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:40,285
Speaker 6:  which is Jeff Bezos's Rocket Company successfully

1406
01:31:40,725 --> 01:31:44,525
Speaker 6:  launched New Glen, it's it's big rocket. I think that was on,

1407
01:31:46,105 --> 01:31:47,045
Speaker 6:  is that today? Thursday?

1408
01:31:47,285 --> 01:31:48,565
Speaker 9:  Thursday? That was today. That was Thursday morning.

1409
01:31:48,855 --> 01:31:50,965
Speaker 6:  Super early this morning. Delayed two o'clock in the morning.

1410
01:31:51,315 --> 01:31:55,165
Speaker 9:  Yeah, Monday morning was the first attempt and but it has now launched and

1411
01:31:55,295 --> 01:31:57,285
Speaker 9:  parts of it went into orbit. This

1412
01:31:57,285 --> 01:32:00,305
Speaker 6:  Seems like a big deal, right? For a couple of reasons. One, because

1413
01:32:01,655 --> 01:32:05,545
Speaker 6:  this company has had a lot of money and a lot of, I

1414
01:32:05,545 --> 01:32:09,105
Speaker 6:  would say Amos and kind of false ish starts over the years.

1415
01:32:09,255 --> 01:32:13,065
Speaker 6:  They've been at this for like a decade, but then also because

1416
01:32:13,765 --> 01:32:17,665
Speaker 6:  it, it, if this continues Blue Origin becomes

1417
01:32:18,415 --> 01:32:22,215
Speaker 6:  real competition to SpaceX for kind of the first time. Like

1418
01:32:22,235 --> 01:32:25,655
Speaker 6:  SpaceX is still pretty far ahead in all of this and has been doing this for

1419
01:32:25,655 --> 01:32:28,775
Speaker 6:  a very long time and is very good at this. But the idea of just there being

1420
01:32:28,775 --> 01:32:32,615
Speaker 6:  another company meaningfully in this race seems

1421
01:32:32,615 --> 01:32:33,415
Speaker 6:  pretty interesting to me,

1422
01:32:33,415 --> 01:32:36,855
Speaker 9:  Particularly as they're trying to do the reusable rocket thing that SpaceX

1423
01:32:36,855 --> 01:32:40,695
Speaker 9:  does and that others don't yet even the ESA just started

1424
01:32:40,695 --> 01:32:43,535
Speaker 9:  launching a new rocket, but it doesn't have the reusable boosters and, and

1425
01:32:43,535 --> 01:32:46,095
Speaker 9:  stuff like that because that really helps you get the price down on the launches,

1426
01:32:46,225 --> 01:32:50,095
Speaker 9:  which is key to SpaceX's business model. And right

1427
01:32:50,155 --> 01:32:53,415
Speaker 9:  now for all of these companies, and there are a lot of companies that are

1428
01:32:53,415 --> 01:32:57,295
Speaker 9:  interested in launching stuff into Orbit, starlink,

1429
01:32:57,435 --> 01:33:01,175
Speaker 9:  SpaceX, starlink being one of them, but also many others including Jeff Bezos's

1430
01:33:01,175 --> 01:33:05,135
Speaker 9:  own Amazon and the Kuper satellite internet satellite constellation

1431
01:33:05,135 --> 01:33:08,855
Speaker 9:  that they're trying to build. You need to be able to launch stuff a lot and

1432
01:33:08,855 --> 01:33:11,695
Speaker 9:  to, to get it up there and having reusable rockets that work is a big part

1433
01:33:11,695 --> 01:33:14,935
Speaker 9:  of it. Doing work that they wanna do for NASA is a big part of having these

1434
01:33:15,095 --> 01:33:18,975
Speaker 9:  reusable rockets going to the moon as Elon Musk says that he wants

1435
01:33:18,975 --> 01:33:22,815
Speaker 9:  to go to Mars If you can get there, but you, you gotta

1436
01:33:22,815 --> 01:33:25,815
Speaker 9:  have it. And they have had so many delays. I think this was supposed to be

1437
01:33:25,935 --> 01:33:29,615
Speaker 9:  launched in 2020, but now it has launched. It mostly

1438
01:33:29,615 --> 01:33:33,015
Speaker 9:  worked. They didn't get the rocket returned, but I think that was, you know,

1439
01:33:33,015 --> 01:33:36,855
Speaker 9:  kind of a, a, a secondary goal and so they're gonna try that on future flights.

1440
01:33:36,855 --> 01:33:40,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it again kind of illustrates how far behind they really

1441
01:33:40,805 --> 01:33:44,645
Speaker 6:  are, but also how much progress they've made that like, it, it's, I I

1442
01:33:44,645 --> 01:33:47,765
Speaker 6:  forget this occasionally and it's nice to be reminded that just launching

1443
01:33:47,805 --> 01:33:51,685
Speaker 6:  a rocket into space, it's very hard, quite

1444
01:33:51,825 --> 01:33:55,725
Speaker 6:  and kind of a big deal when you can do it from scratch. There's a lot

1445
01:33:55,725 --> 01:33:58,965
Speaker 6:  more to do. The, the landing thing is hard. SpaceX is out here like catching

1446
01:33:58,965 --> 01:34:02,925
Speaker 6:  it with chopsticks. Like there's a lot of work left to do to catch up to

1447
01:34:02,955 --> 01:34:06,885
Speaker 6:  what SpaceX is up to. But this is, this is a, like a huge step and I

1448
01:34:06,885 --> 01:34:10,565
Speaker 6:  think the more I've talked to people in the kind of private space

1449
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:14,765
Speaker 6:  industry, the more, the more I get the sense that there's a real kind

1450
01:34:14,765 --> 01:34:18,605
Speaker 6:  of rising tide moment happening where a lot of people are leaving

1451
01:34:18,745 --> 01:34:21,285
Speaker 6:  SpaceX who know how to do this stuff and they're starting new companies and

1452
01:34:21,285 --> 01:34:25,125
Speaker 6:  there's more stuff being done and that technology is becoming more kind of

1453
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:28,805
Speaker 6:  commoditized and available and like the, the acceleration of the

1454
01:34:28,805 --> 01:34:32,725
Speaker 6:  competition in this space might start to happen pretty fast in the same way

1455
01:34:32,725 --> 01:34:35,445
Speaker 6:  that like Tesla had a commanding lead for a long time and then everybody

1456
01:34:35,445 --> 01:34:39,205
Speaker 6:  kind of all at once in part because of a lot of people who left Tesla also

1457
01:34:39,205 --> 01:34:42,085
Speaker 6:  learned how to make electric cars. That there's a real sense that the same

1458
01:34:42,085 --> 01:34:45,845
Speaker 6:  thing is going to start to happen in the kind of private commercial space

1459
01:34:46,245 --> 01:34:50,045
Speaker 6:  industry, which I think is very cool. Just as somebody who really likes watching

1460
01:34:50,105 --> 01:34:53,885
Speaker 6:  two hour long launch videos like the one that that Blue Origin put out

1461
01:34:53,885 --> 01:34:57,445
Speaker 6:  today. I would just like more of those. That's all I I need. And

1462
01:34:57,445 --> 01:35:01,005
Speaker 9:  It's all controlled by the same few tech billionaires slash

1463
01:35:01,245 --> 01:35:01,645
Speaker 9:  oligarchs.

1464
01:35:01,915 --> 01:35:05,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah, they all have the same plan. It's get a lot of money and then launch

1465
01:35:05,445 --> 01:35:09,245
Speaker 6:  internet into space. Sure. It's, it's fine. It is what it's,

1466
01:35:09,445 --> 01:35:09,805
Speaker 6:  it's what

1467
01:35:09,825 --> 01:35:10,125
Speaker 9:  I'd do.

1468
01:35:11,245 --> 01:35:15,125
Speaker 6:  I mean it kind of is right? Like at some point you have so much money, what

1469
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:19,045
Speaker 6:  are you gonna do except launch Rockets or do the, the other

1470
01:35:19,175 --> 01:35:21,845
Speaker 6:  Bezos thing, which he's like, what if I made a clock that lasts forever and

1471
01:35:21,845 --> 01:35:25,765
Speaker 6:  like perfect rich guy brain like that. That's it. Jeff, you

1472
01:35:25,765 --> 01:35:29,725
Speaker 6:  did Rich Guy brain crushed it. Bill Gates is like, what if I cured all

1473
01:35:29,725 --> 01:35:33,685
Speaker 6:  diseases and Jeff Bezos is like clock That goes all always. All right,

1474
01:35:33,685 --> 01:35:37,325
Speaker 6:  Jeff. Godspeed my friend. All right Richard, we have gone

1475
01:35:37,585 --> 01:35:40,645
Speaker 6:  way over. It's time for us to go. Thank you for being here.

1476
01:35:41,635 --> 01:35:45,605
Speaker 6:  This has been a delight. Neli is no longer invited back to this show. He's

1477
01:35:45,605 --> 01:35:48,765
Speaker 6:  off being fancy and he can stay off being fancy as far as I'm concerned.

1478
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:53,615
Speaker 6:  There's so much more to happen here. I'm so tired. It's middle of January,

1479
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:58,495
Speaker 6:  the TikTok ban may or may not happen on Sunday. Inauguration

1480
01:35:58,495 --> 01:36:02,255
Speaker 6:  is on Monday. There's all kinds of news and tech stuff.

1481
01:36:02,255 --> 01:36:05,855
Speaker 6:  There's like I, I learned recently, I live in DC and all the tech CEOs are

1482
01:36:05,855 --> 01:36:09,695
Speaker 6:  here like partying around the inauguration, which is bizarre in ways that

1483
01:36:09,695 --> 01:36:13,575
Speaker 6:  I'm not really prepared to reckon with a lot's happening. We have a

1484
