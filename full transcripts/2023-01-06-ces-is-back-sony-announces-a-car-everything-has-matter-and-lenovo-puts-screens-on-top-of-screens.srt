Speaker 3:  I like, think of me or Richard.

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,010
Speaker 5:  Do you think of fake Eli? Like is fake Eli coming back? Because I hear that

24
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,090
Speaker 5:  those Twitter accounts are actually pretty easy to make.

25
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,010
Speaker 3:  Still fake Ne Eli could come back.

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,290
Speaker 5:  It's, it's just $8.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,250
Speaker 4:  It's true. Jeffrey Fowler made another fake senator on

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,050
Speaker 4:  Twitter. Another fake verified Senator.

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,890
Speaker 3:  I need to make a new fake ne Eli using my work email address again

30
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,410
Speaker 3:  and my, my home phone number. It'll be fine.

31
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,730
Speaker 5:  Nothing bad could come of that.

32
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,010
Speaker 4:  If you have a Twitter account that's over 90 days old, but you want to donate

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,890
Speaker 4:  to Alex's situation, by all means ambitious. Reach out

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,210
Speaker 4:  to Alex. That's it. That's where the three of us are on the show. Welcome

35
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,250
Speaker 4:  back to 2023. We've been off for a couple weeks. We gotta see if we remember

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,490
Speaker 4:  how to do the show that we've been doing for years.

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,730
Speaker 4:  Fine. It's also c s the consumer electronic show's happening in Las

38
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,650
Speaker 4:  Vegas. We've got a big Verge team down there. I am not there for like the

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,170
Speaker 4:  first time in 12 years. I feel like the, the covid years that didn't go don't

40
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,370
Speaker 4:  count.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,650
Speaker 3:  They don't. Absolutely not. So

42
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,570
Speaker 4:  I have like a 12 to 13 year run, many of which were memorably

43
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,050
Speaker 4:  spent with Richard Lawler as babies.

44
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,250
Speaker 5:  Memorably is probably not the correct word. No one can say for

45
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:21,410
Speaker 5:  certain,

46
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,010
Speaker 4:  What's the word for something you remember? Because you don't remember it.

47
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,690
Speaker 5:  There's a, there's a gap, but No, it's weird being at home. I, I found out

48
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,330
Speaker 5:  that people do things in the first week of the year that I had no idea about.

49
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,810
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. Wild. Yeah.

50
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,730
Speaker 4:  There's all kinds of action. Like time does not stop and get Vortex into

51
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,410
Speaker 4:  Las Vegas. I will say, and Richard, I don't know if you feel this way,

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,770
Speaker 4:  I miss it and I kind of, there's a part of me that wishes I was

53
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,730
Speaker 4:  in Vegas. That part is very small and I am beating in

54
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,570
Speaker 4:  submission on the daily, but there's like stuff happening at CES this

55
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:52,730
Speaker 4:  year.

56
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,050
Speaker 5:  There's a person inside of me who only exists when I wake up in the, the,

57
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,920
Speaker 5:  the Marriott in Las Vegas. Yeah. And, and they are

58
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,280
Speaker 5:  dormant the entire rest of the year and just for one week they run free and

59
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,680
Speaker 5:  I'm not

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,560
Speaker 4:  Really sure it's like activated by 0% humidity. Like the air is so

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,080
Speaker 4:  dry that a different version of you comes out and it's like, what I need

62
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,160
Speaker 4:  is a vodka soda and some swirly carpets and

63
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,280
Speaker 4:  at least three full memory cards, SD

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,120
Speaker 4:  cards of photos of laptops. And that's who I really am. And

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,840
Speaker 4:  there's a part of me that's jealous. The other reason I'm jealous that I'm

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,480
Speaker 4:  not there is, this is de Bones first year at CES as a Google

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,050

79
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,970

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,070
Speaker 4:  the year. All right, let's start with this car. So Sony a

114
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,870
Speaker 4:  couple years ago announced a car at CS and it was the most

115
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,270
Speaker 4:  vaporware car that has ever existed. Like I don't think it even had motors

116
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,150
Speaker 4:  in it. There were just like, there were Sony, handful of PlayStation announcements.

117
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,110
Speaker 4:  Do you like Spider-Man? Here's our car. Sony at cs.

118
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,030
Speaker 3:  Was it, there wasn't even a physical thing. Was there?

119
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,270
Speaker 4:  There was a, there was a model of a car car. I don't know if it moved.

120
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,350
Speaker 3:  The idea of a car. Yeah,

121
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,270
Speaker 5:  There was, they showed videos of cars, of things that were supposedly cars

122
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,790
Speaker 5:  driving around.

123
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,670
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And they were like, this was at the time when like the vaporware car

124
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,590
Speaker 4:  explosion was like fully happening. Yeah. So Sony asked this car, everyone's

125
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,110
Speaker 4:  like, this is vapor, it's never going anywhere. Then they announced a partnership

126
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,030
Speaker 4:  with Honda to make cars. And the name of the partnership is Sony Honda Mobility.

127
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,070
Speaker 4:  So you see this is just a very literal situation. Yeah. Sony wants to make

128
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,950
Speaker 4:  a car. Honda makes cars. Let's start a new joint venture. It's called Sony

129
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,910
Speaker 4:  Honda Mobility. Cool. This year at CS Sony holds

130
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,870
Speaker 4:  a press conference. Press conference is all over the place. I encourage you

131
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,750
Speaker 4:  to go watch it. It's like Sony decided not to announce TVs at cs,

132
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,670
Speaker 4:  which if you are an avid CS watcher, you know this is a big

133
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,030
Speaker 4:  deal cuz this is where all the TVs get announced. Sony's like, nope, screw

134
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,750
Speaker 4:  it. Opting out. We'll do TVs later. Here's the new PSVR two.

135
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,990
Speaker 4:  Here's some movie stuff. Here's a Grand Theresa movie. Oh and by the way,

136
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,870
Speaker 4:  we made it. Here's our car. And so the Sony Honda

137
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,150
Speaker 4:  Mobility car will be a new brand. I can't

138
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,790
Speaker 4:  even say it.

139
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,470
Speaker 3:  I feel ya.

140
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,910
Speaker 4:  I'm so mad at you.

141
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,470
Speaker 4:  It's called Aila, A F E E L

142
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,230
Speaker 4:  a and they shut off their first car, which you know,

143
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,430
Speaker 4:  looks like a shoe as all modern EVs do. Like a,

144
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,070
Speaker 4:  a cross between a Honda Accord and a Lucid Air.

145
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,270
Speaker 4:  Like all cars now have the same like light bar vibes. It's like a

146
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,590
Speaker 4:  low slung sedan. Yeah.

147
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,870
Speaker 3:  They don't look, they all look like Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg designed

148
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,510
Speaker 3:  them in 2002.

149
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,710
Speaker 4:  What do cars of the future look like? This it, you know, like when you're

150
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,110
Speaker 4:  a kid and you like are learning how to draw a car and you draw like

151
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,630
Speaker 3:  This

152
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,710
Speaker 4:  Two wheels and a bubble. Yep.

153
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,590
Speaker 3:  This is what you draw

154
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,350
Speaker 5:  Because I could not actually draw different parts. So I just drew one

155
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,670
Speaker 5:  arc and then wheels.

156
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,470
Speaker 4:  So it's, it's called again, I wanna come back to the name a Aila, which if

157
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,230
Speaker 4:  you go and watch the video, you the poor man.

158
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,790
Speaker 4:  He's, you know, he's like excited and he is like our new brand and then he

159
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,670
Speaker 4:  is like aila and there's, there's just not applause because

160
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,670
Speaker 4:  no one believes that he said

161
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,110
Speaker 3:  It. No one applauses that Dave.

162
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,950
Speaker 4:  And the idea here is that Honda bill a car and

163
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,830
Speaker 4:  Sony will stuff it full of screens that run Sony software

164
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,990
Speaker 4:  and play Sony movies. That that's the idea. It's like very

165
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,910
Speaker 4:  clearly the idea.

166
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,790
Speaker 3:  I like one of

167
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,230
Speaker 4:  Those things. But then there's one screen

168
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,510
Speaker 5:  Who doesn't wanna pay $60,000 for a psp. Yes.

169
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,400
Speaker 4:  The front of the car. The middle of of the light bar. This is the thing that

170
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,240
Speaker 4:  I am absolutely obsessed with and I really encourage you to go watch

171
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,720
Speaker 4:  our super cut of this event. So there's the two headlights and then there's

172
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,520
Speaker 4:  the light bar in the middle of the headlights. Almost all cars EVs especially

173
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,160
Speaker 4:  have this like light bar element in the middle of the headlights now, right?

174
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

175
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,360
Speaker 3:  It's electronic.

176
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,200
Speaker 4:  Okay. That is Sony's like what if that was a screen, a straight

177
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,240
Speaker 4:  up screen in the middle of the headlights charging screen and then in the

178
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,160
Speaker 4:  presentation they show you the things a screen could be used for and

179
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,920
Speaker 4:  one of them is just straight up advertising for Spider-Man. No way. Home.

180
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,200
Speaker 4:  So you're driving around and you're a Fila and you've got

181
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
Speaker 4:  Spider-Man. No way home on the front of your car. You can also

182
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,880
Speaker 4:  display the weather, which I think is amazing to display the

183
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,120
Speaker 4:  weather to other

184
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,080
Speaker 3:  People. It's helpful for the people you like, just run on the

185
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
Speaker 3:  ass of other people on the highway. You're like, I need you

186
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,800
Speaker 4:  To know the weather backwards. So you would just be showing the weather to

187
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,720
Speaker 4:  people backwards in their mirrors. I mean it's, it's perfect example of,

188
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,240
Speaker 4:  look,

189
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,560
Speaker 5:  Viju V didn't happen. We had to make it, we had to do something. And this

190
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,000
Speaker 4:  Sony doesn't know why it's building a car. It's, it's just very obvious

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,680
Speaker 4:  that Sony has not yet figured out why it's doing this.

192
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,100
Speaker 4:  Honda knows why it's building an ev. Honda's got that part

193
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,020
Speaker 4:  locked down. They're Honda Sony's like what we're gonna add to it is

194
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,860
Speaker 4:  Spider-Man and screens. Where are some places we can put those things?

195
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,780
Speaker 4:  And one of the places they settled on was the front of the car.

196
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,620
Speaker 4:  It's very good. Yes.

197
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,300
Speaker 3:  Aila. Yes. Perfect. No notes.

198
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,980
Speaker 4:  Aila. Now my personal aila theory is that again during one

199
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,540
Speaker 4:  one, what is the word for this? When you have a memory that is defined

200
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,620
Speaker 4:  by the absence of the memory

201
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,820
Speaker 3:  A blackout. Like

202
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,780
Speaker 4:  You, I know I was in Vegas with Richard. I I know, I

203
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,470
Speaker 4:  know that. And then I know I was at home there,

204
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,830
Speaker 5:  There are expense receipts, but what happened? Who can say

205
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,430
Speaker 3:  What does the memory taste like? Does it taste like vodka

206
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,630
Speaker 3:  whiskeys regret? Yes.

207
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,190
Speaker 4:  All of all of the above. All of them. It, it, it, and, and I know that Richard

208
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,470
Speaker 4:  and I are friends for life because of this memory, but it, I got nothing

209
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,710
Speaker 4:  else.

210
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,750
Speaker 5:  And somehow in the middle of this, that's when someone said

211
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,750
Speaker 5:  Aila

212
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,230
Speaker 4:  No.

213
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,910
Speaker 5:  Or they, they wrote it down and then they found it later

214
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,950
Speaker 4:  Down. Everyone. No the what is the ultimate Vegas c

215
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,830
Speaker 4:  e s song in every presentation? It's, I got a feeling by the black

216
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,790
Speaker 4:  eye peas, You cannot be, you cannot be

217
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,470
Speaker 4:  in that environment without hearing that song. For there was at least two

218
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,430
Speaker 4:  years where like the words of Mazeltov rang out of every

219
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,350
Speaker 4:  CS presentation cuz they were just playing. I got a feeling by the Black

220
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,230
Speaker 4:  Eyed Peas and now we have a feel like, I swear to God this is

221
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,190
Speaker 4:  what happened. Like they, Sony and Honda were up in the club and

222
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,910
Speaker 4:  that song was playing and they're like, I know what it's called. And now

223
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,350
Speaker 4:  we have, now we have to talk about this seriously for months to come. Years,

224
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,590
Speaker 5:  Years. It's not coming out until 2026.

225
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,230
Speaker 3:  They cried a lot that night though. Like they hugged coming out.

226
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,790
Speaker 3:  It's not allegedly

227
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,560
Speaker 4:  They're gonna take start taking orders in 2024

228
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,040
Speaker 4:  and they claim that they will ship the first ones in North America. And

229
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,640
Speaker 4:  they said the second half of 2025,

230
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,320
Speaker 3:  Who are the people that are gonna order this?

231
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,840
Speaker 4:  I mean this is a pretty huge risk. I think what you, it's de-risked by the

232
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,800
Speaker 4:  fact that it's more or less a Honda, right? Yeah. Okay. So you you know that

233
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,680
Speaker 4:  they know how to make

234
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
Speaker 3:  A call. Yeah, Honda exists. They make cars, we drive them.

235
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,840
Speaker 4:  But then you've got this like Bonker Sony

236
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,520
Speaker 4:  integration where they're, and oh by the way the, the whole car runs Qualcomm

237
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,920
Speaker 4:  tech and so it's Qualcomm chip set, Qualcom,

238
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,040
Speaker 4:  Qualcomm autonomous driving Qualcom interfaces like

239
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,080
Speaker 4:  everything. So

240
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,400
Speaker 3:  How much battery life is it gonna get versus the Apple car? Like 30%

241
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,240
Speaker 4:  Less. It runs really hot. The camera though in, in

242
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
Speaker 4:  some situations is better. I love that there's a charging the screen on the

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,680
Speaker 4:  front. You can, it could be a charging indicator. They're throwing out the

244
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,320
Speaker 4:  idea of fully integrating at PS five.

245
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,920
Speaker 3:  That's what I've always wanted in my

246
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,640
Speaker 4:  Car. This is the single silliest CS announcement that I've ever covered.

247
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,920
Speaker 4:  And if you've been listening to me at CS for a long time,

248
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,320
Speaker 4:  you know that that is a high bar. We have covered some truly

249
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,280
Speaker 4:  bonkers CS products. One year Qualcomm hired the

250
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,920
Speaker 4:  cast of Billy Madison to jump around in,

251
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,400
Speaker 4:  in furry suits claiming to be the next generation of technology.

252
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,440
Speaker 4:  This is a real thing that happened. And this is by

253
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,560
Speaker 4:  far the silliest thing that I've ever seen because the entire point of it

254
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,120
Speaker 4:  Dish

255
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,600
Speaker 5:  Brought, brought a real kangaroo

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,400
Speaker 4:  Ones. That's true

257
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,040
Speaker 5:  For

258
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,680
Speaker 4:  Whatever. It's the entire point of this car is to get you to subscribe to

259
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,280
Speaker 4:  Sony software inside the car. I don't think this car's ever gonna ship.

260
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,240
Speaker 4:  That's just my, I'm just, I'm calling it. I do not think the will ever ship.

261
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,380
Speaker 3:  You don't think a car with an integrated PS five

262
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,660
Speaker 3:  and the ability to play Spider-Man on the grill

263
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,740
Speaker 4:  A will attempt to embody three main themes, autonomy, augmentation,

264
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,780
Speaker 4:  and affinity. It's bad, it's bad. I'm just telling it's bad.

265
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,980
Speaker 5:  Okay, wait. If there's anything that Sony's good at, it's launching subscription

266
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,460
Speaker 5:  service that's never, let's never fail. And so I

267
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,660
Speaker 5:  I'm yeah I'm taking, I'm taking the highest out on this for sure.

268
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,380
Speaker 3:  So you think people are just gonna subscribe to own the car?

269
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,460
Speaker 5:  You just like a Yeah. PlayStation Cloud and game

270
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,790
Speaker 4:  All. I cannot believe it's called dfc. I can't believe that we all

271
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,030
Speaker 4:  have to say it. I can't believe it. They said it. I can't believe they paid

272
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,990
Speaker 4:  some consulting company like millions of dollars for this name.

273
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,350
Speaker 4:  But

274
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,510
Speaker 3:  I can't believe we've only done one pun about it. I think like that's

275
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,030
Speaker 3:  very impressive.

276
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,470
Speaker 4:  It's just the beginning of the year. We'll we'll come back to it.

277
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,470
Speaker 3:  It's true.

278
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,950
Speaker 4:  So that's like, I would say this is the news outta CS is this

279
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,950
Speaker 4:  Sony Honda Mobility new brand of a car. It's what everyone is talking about.

280
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,350
Speaker 4:  I'm just calling it right now. This thing is pure vapor and we'll never ship.

281
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,430
Speaker 5:  Do you think they'll ever ship any kind of Sony car or just not this?

282
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,670
Speaker 4:  It's not this. And if you, even if you think about, we talked about this

283
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,630
Speaker 4:  show so many times, like this is not the kind of car that people

284
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,550
Speaker 4:  are buying. People buy mid-size crossover SUVs. So showing

285
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,710
Speaker 4:  up with your weirdo sedan, like you can't even get the tax credits for this

286
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,080
Speaker 4:  right now in the United States the tax credits are all for SUVs. Do you know

287
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,000
Speaker 4:  the Tesla model Y and the Mustang Machi aren't getting a tax credit cuz they're

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,880
Speaker 4:  classified as sedans. So good. I mean it's just fully silly.

289
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,720
Speaker 3:  Just put a lift kit on it, they'll be fine.

290
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,240
Speaker 4:  You like roll up to the IRS with your lifted model Y.

291
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,040
Speaker 3:  This is the SUV now.

292
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,280
Speaker 4:  All right. Other car stuff at cs. I'm just calling it if you believe that

293
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,040
Speaker 4:  Aila will ship, let us know if you work at Sony and you can

294
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,680
Speaker 4:  show us a working production unit of the I will,

295
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,200
Speaker 4:  we'll talk about it but it's, I mean it's called the Aila. Okay, here's my

296
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,760
Speaker 4:  other question. Will they change the name if it ever ships?

297
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,480
Speaker 3:  No, they have to keep

298
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,520
Speaker 4:  It. They're committed to it now.

299
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,640
Speaker 3:  I mean they will absolutely change the name but I think even now

300
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,040
Speaker 3:  we need to say you cannot change the name. You made your choice. You got

301
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,520
Speaker 3:  drunk at the club a couple of years ago. You bonded,

302
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,560
Speaker 3:  you agreed you can't no takebacks. It's a feel

303
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:41,840
Speaker 3:  will

304
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,560
Speaker 4:  I am outside of the trunk. He's like here I,

305
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,760
Speaker 4:  you promised me

306
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,440
Speaker 4:  all where

307
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,680
Speaker 5:  Is will I am? How is he not, how is he not involved in this after all the

308
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,480
Speaker 5:  tech stuff that he wanted? This is the most, somehow this launched and he's

309
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,240
Speaker 5:  nowhere to be found. That's suspicious. That is very suspicious.

310
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,280
Speaker 3:  Did they name the execs who worked on it?

311
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,520
Speaker 4:  No. If will I am worked on this, he would've been named a creative director

312
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,120
Speaker 4:  of a Fila

313
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,880
Speaker 3:  Theoretically,

314
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Speaker 4:  Which is his title with all the things he works on. Obviously we once did

315
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,320
Speaker 4:  an article and I think the headline as Will I am is the Kiss of Death

316
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,960
Speaker 4:  because every tech product that he has ever launched as a creative director

317
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,680
Speaker 4:  has been a spectacular flop. Dan Sievert once published the headline

318
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,960
Speaker 4:  like Will I AM's bracelet? Like I don't want it to touch my body.

319
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,080
Speaker 4:  It's Dan Have you, you've encountered Dan Sievert before. He is not

320
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,040
Speaker 4:  prone to bursts of hyperbole. No. And he is like, I don't want this

321
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,760
Speaker 4:  thing near my body.

322
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,200
Speaker 3:  Like don't even wanna look at it. Touched his hair, he's upset.

323
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's been a couple years since we've covered a bad William Gadget.

324
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,440
Speaker 4:  This is his moment. All right, we should talking about bmw, the iVision

325
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,440
Speaker 4:  d it it talks

326
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,680
Speaker 3:  It's your friend because this was the one that had the Arnold Schwarzenegger

327
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,560
Speaker 3:  commercial attached to it, right? Yeah. Where he spends the whole time

328
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,120
Speaker 3:  talking about how they're gonna be best friends and then he like helps a

329
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,760
Speaker 3:  lady hook up with some dude and they never show the most interesting part

330
00:16:59,760 --> 00:16:59,880
Speaker 3:  of

331
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,640
Speaker 4:  The car. Yeah. That that's CS in a nutshell is they have a celebrity. That's

332
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,480
Speaker 4:  right. They did a skit. They don't show you the product. Let me just give

333
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,120
Speaker 4:  you, so the iVision D is a kind of like a retro futuristic bmw,

334
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,880
Speaker 4:  right? It's got some like Camaro vibes in the front end,

335
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,760
Speaker 4:  like sixties Camaro vibes in the front end. But

336
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,280
Speaker 3:  It's got the ugly, everybody's doing these ugly hubcaps

337
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,120
Speaker 4:  That's that's just like, that means EVs.

338
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,360
Speaker 3:  Yeah, they're bad.

339
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,840
Speaker 4:  So iVision D stands for digital emotional experience. D e e

340
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,480
Speaker 4:  let me just read this word to you. The headlights and the closed

341
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,240
Speaker 4:  B M W kidney grill also form a

342
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,920
Speaker 4:  common fidget to dole icon on a

343
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,680
Speaker 4:  uniform surface allowing the vehicle to produce different facial

344
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,440
Speaker 4:  expressions. And what they mean by fidgital is

345
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,840
Speaker 4:  the combination of the word physical and digital.

346
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,760
Speaker 5:  They were supposed to launch an NFT with this, but then they canceled it

347
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,680
Speaker 5:  when the prices crashed and they couldn't get fidgital out of the press release.

348
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,200
Speaker 5:  That's what happened here because that's the only place where they use this

349
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Speaker 5:  work.

350
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,280
Speaker 4:  It's, it's very bad. The whole point of this is that it

351
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,680
Speaker 4:  has this assistant and then, and the inside of this car, we don't really

352
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,600
Speaker 4:  know what the car is gonna look like or if it really exists because all the

353
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,400
Speaker 4:  pictures are renders. But the whole point of this is that it will

354
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,280
Speaker 4:  talk back to you and that your driver, you can create like

355
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,520
Speaker 4:  a metaverse avatar which can be projected onto the side window of the car.

356
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,360
Speaker 3:  Like those are all things I do not want in my life.

357
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah, this was the N F T card. This was supposed to have your, your ape on

358
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,240
Speaker 5:  the outside and then they realized they couldn't do that and they just, they

359
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,680
Speaker 5:  still had the car renders laying around and they had to do something with

360
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,920
Speaker 5:  it. They're like oops. They had, they had already mocked those up.

361
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,560
Speaker 4:  Wait, is that real? This was an N F T

362
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,760
Speaker 3:  Car so they just dropped it.

363
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,920
Speaker 5:  I mean that must be the truth because every single thing about it matches

364
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,640
Speaker 5:  with n ft reality mixed reality. You put your

365
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,630
Speaker 5:  avatar on the outside, this is a tokenized vehicle. This is

366
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,790
Speaker 5:  a metaverse experience from bmw. Right?

367
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,270
Speaker 4:  Like and then they just didn't say the N F T parts because that's

368
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,110
Speaker 4:  anathema right now.

369
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,550
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Does it have the BMW logo on it?

370
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,550
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. It's got the round on the front.

371
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,350
Speaker 3:  Okay. There it is. Very tiny. It

372
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,270
Speaker 4:  Is truly one of the strangest, strangest cars I've ever seen.

373
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,350
Speaker 4:  It's, you just gotta go look at the pictures. It's all renders. This is

374
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,150
Speaker 4:  the most vaporware car we have ever covered. Like it does,

375
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,470
Speaker 4:  even the prototype doesn't exist. It's great. I love it.

376
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,830
Speaker 3:  It's so goofy.

377
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,630
Speaker 4:  Anyway, BMW is a company that charging subscriptions for heated seats. So

378
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,430
Speaker 4:  we'll see if they're weird non nft N F T car succeeds.

379
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,630
Speaker 3:  But what's annoying about it is that there's one

380
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,910
Speaker 3:  part of it that is real and they, they did last year

381
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,190
Speaker 3:  and they, they they showed off in this giant render that kind

382
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,630
Speaker 3:  of like destroyed all of my hope in humanity. And that's that it has the

383
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,750
Speaker 3:  e ink panels that we saw last year but in color, I

384
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,150
Speaker 4:  Mean because

385
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,910
Speaker 3:  Like we saw the cars last year, they had real cars driving around

386
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,950
Speaker 3:  CES last year with real e ink panels in it. And this year they

387
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,630
Speaker 3:  have real fake cars driving around in real fake

388
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,550
Speaker 3:  reality with actual real e ink panels, which is this

389
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,350
Speaker 3:  new like tech called Prism three from ein. And that's

390
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,990
Speaker 3:  really, really cool and I'm really annoyed because that's actually really,

391
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,790
Speaker 3:  really cool. Real technology paired with like the

392
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,990
Speaker 3:  cartoon car with your N F T on the face.

393
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,910
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I will say that the fact that there are no actual pictures of the

394
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,590
Speaker 4:  eye vision D makes me wonder.

395
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,670
Speaker 3:  It's just all in motion. Yeah,

396
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:25,950
Speaker 4:  It's

397
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,990
Speaker 3:  And there's no real person driving it. It's always a cartoon lady driving

398
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,190
Speaker 3:  it

399
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,070
Speaker 4:  Or it's like really far away. Yeah, I guess there's one picture of

400
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,710
Speaker 4:  a guy, but then like in this picture, the car is all white.

401
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,630
Speaker 4:  So again,

402
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,670
Speaker 5:  I'm watching this video and it's blowing my

403
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,350
Speaker 4:  Mind. Why is that?

404
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,510
Speaker 5:  I, I don't know why Al, I I don't know why, why the Terminator is here.

405
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,190
Speaker 5:  I don't know why.

406
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,480
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, no you have to to go watch this video. This is what Alex talking

407
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,680
Speaker 4:  about. This is what saying at the start like this, the video is the most

408
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,400
Speaker 4:  CS thing you can watch.

409
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,240
Speaker 3:  The video is so

410
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,920
Speaker 4:  Good like Arnold Schwarzenegger's in it. But

411
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,040
Speaker 3:  They don't show the panels.

412
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,120
Speaker 4:  They don't show the panels and the, and except for the last shot where they're

413
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,560
Speaker 4:  like helicopter overing, they're helicoptering over the car

414
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,680
Speaker 4:  and then it's like rendering. Yeah I don't, I'm just saying

415
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Speaker 3:  It's, it's not a real car

416
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,160
Speaker 4:  Two of the most but

417
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,360
Speaker 3:  The e ink tech is real.

418
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,240
Speaker 4:  The e ink tech is real but is it mounted on a B BMW that

419
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,680
Speaker 4:  exists?

420
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,260
Speaker 3:  So E no, but it's like

421
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,740
Speaker 3:  E Ink sent me, they sent me a whole thing talking about it. It's

422
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,900
Speaker 3:  their four particle ASEP system

423
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,660
Speaker 3:  and ASAP has two branches and one is what you get, which

424
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,580
Speaker 3:  is like E-readers. The new gallery, three color E ink

425
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,620
Speaker 3:  that's coming out later this year. And then the other side is

426
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,900
Speaker 3:  prism three, which is what is on this and it's

427
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,820
Speaker 3:  more like a mesh. It's not like actual panels. It's

428
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,620
Speaker 3:  really weird. And I was like, oh this is so exciting. Oh it's on a

429
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,860
Speaker 3:  fake car that will never exist and is all a cartoon.

430
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm

431
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,160
Speaker 3:  Deeply disappointed.

432
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,240
Speaker 4:  I love it because I think the audacity of launching in

433
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,120
Speaker 4:  intensely vaporware cars at CS the, for a long time

434
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,920
Speaker 4:  the way CS worked was we would see the insides of cars at cs. Yeah

435
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,720
Speaker 4:  because that's where the screens were. And we would hear about like whatever

436
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,480
Speaker 4:  q and X software upgrade was coming to like Jeeps next year

437
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,160
Speaker 4:  and then a week later at the Detroit Auto show we would see the outsides

438
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,440
Speaker 4:  of cars.

439
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,000
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

440
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,200
Speaker 4:  And now we're just going for broke on What about what we just showed you

441
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,080
Speaker 4:  entire fake cars.

442
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,240
Speaker 3:  What did we just showed you? A lot of really cool renders at CES with our

443
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:28,560
Speaker 3:  big

444
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,460
Speaker 4:  Screens. That's a lot. Alright. Some other car news at cs. Some

445
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,300
Speaker 4:  good stuff here in Mercedes installing thousands of ev fast

446
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,340
Speaker 4:  chargers across the United States. You're gonna spend a billion dollars on

447
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,260
Speaker 4:  it in conjunction with ChargePoint. They're gonna install 400 of

448
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,140
Speaker 4:  these hubs each with approximately six charging stations. Key cities,

449
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,420
Speaker 4:  major highways. This is good, this is good news. They needed to do this a

450
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:50,740
Speaker 4:  long time ago.

451
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,700
Speaker 3:  Did you see the part of the, the press release where they're like, well we're

452
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,460
Speaker 3:  not gonna put it in like some weird by the weird dumpster in like a shady

453
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,020
Speaker 3:  area. These are gonna be nice charging points in nice areas.

454
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,500
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I was like, oh is is that a problem now?

455
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,980
Speaker 4:  It's a huge problem now. Like

456
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,220
Speaker 3:  Are they just did like where are, where are the charge I I always assumed

457
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,180
Speaker 3:  the chargers were always in the nice areas cuz everybody drives Teslas.

458
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,740
Speaker 4:  Yeah the Tesla chargers are generally a nicer experience. Ian Some of those

459
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,660
Speaker 4:  are weird. Yeah but like your average Electrify America single

460
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,340
Speaker 4:  charger is like broken. They might be anywhere. Right? There's like

461
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,100
Speaker 4:  coyotes howling in the distance. Even if you go watch our,

462
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,060
Speaker 4:  our Ford Lightning review video, we went to the charger on

463
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,380
Speaker 4:  the highway and it was nice. I remember that dumpster.

464
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,380
Speaker 3:  That's

465
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,260
Speaker 4:  True. And you know I, I've talked to many car CEOs and

466
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,300
Speaker 4:  I always ask 'em about this and they've, they've been punting and I think

467
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,500
Speaker 4:  them admitting that the chargers are by dumpsters is an important sign of

468
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,600
Speaker 4:  progress. Like step one, admit the chargers are currently by dumpsters.

469
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,840
Speaker 4:  Step two spend a billion dollars putting them somewhere else.

470
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,120
Speaker 4:  So that's good news. A good bit of CS news for Mercedes there

471
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,800
Speaker 4:  other little stuff car-wise ring car cam. Wait, who

472
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,720
Speaker 4:  knows why anybody wants this? The little ring dash cam

473
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,680
Speaker 5:  People were really interested in this story and people

474
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,440
Speaker 4:  Love it. People love dash cams. Most dash cams are made up by weirdo brands.

475
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,140
Speaker 3:  Yeah. They love a dash cam and they're like oh I recognize this brand but

476
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,900
Speaker 3:  you don't want this brand Go get like your weird never heard of before

477
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,220
Speaker 3:  company

478
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,060
Speaker 4:  The

479
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,980
Speaker 3:  One better dash cams

480
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,460
Speaker 4:  One that isn't deeply embedded with the police already. Yeah

481
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,780
Speaker 3:  Great. Don't get the police one.

482
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,260
Speaker 4:  Anyway, it's finally shipping for 200 bucks. The rings dash cam 200 bucks

483
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,420
Speaker 4:  and then two little bits of Google

484
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,140
Speaker 4:  Android Auto News. I mean the first one is just hilarious.

485
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,020
Speaker 4:  They have Google put out a split screen version of

486
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,500
Speaker 4:  Android Auto for cars with wide screen displays a little bit ago and now

487
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,140
Speaker 4:  it's really not to everyone. And they made a little video. They're it? Yes.

488
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,020
Speaker 4:  Nice bit of Google News. It looks exactly like CarPlay, like

489
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,140
Speaker 3:  Just identical

490
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,980
Speaker 5:  CarPlay from like three years ago. Yeah. Like Apple figured this out a

491
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,620
Speaker 5:  while ago.

492
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,820
Speaker 4:  Yeah it's like, it's fairly funny that Apple and Google are in the cycle

493
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,550
Speaker 4:  of just fully copying each other and neither one of these things.

494
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,440
Speaker 4:  Is that good? Just put it out there. They're both

495
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,600
Speaker 4:  fine. That's it. They're, you cannot claim that they're anything

496
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,320
Speaker 4:  better than fine. Which is a a a meaningful step

497
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,600
Speaker 4:  over what most car manufacturers could do.

498
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,360
Speaker 3:  I was have to say they're better than what the car manufacturers do. Cuz

499
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,280
Speaker 3:  if I have to do Mazda's built-in system or

500
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,220
Speaker 3:  Apple CarPlay, I'm going Apple CarPlay every time the Mazda system's

501
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,140
Speaker 5:  Horrible. What you don't like Honda's 2011 Android tablet.

502
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,700
Speaker 5:  You're right.

503
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,380
Speaker 4:  This is like the curse of low expectations, right? You're like

504
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,220
Speaker 4:  our bar that we have to beat is Ford Sync

505
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,300
Speaker 4:  actively torturing you.

506
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,740
Speaker 3:  Just kicking

507
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,940
Speaker 4:  You the bar. We have to clear. Yeah. Is Mazda

508
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,980
Speaker 4:  deleting all the money in your bank account when you try to put in a navigation

509
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,340
Speaker 4:  way pointer like whatever it is.

510
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,260
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

511
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,620
Speaker 4:  It's a low bar.

512
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,160
Speaker 3:  They cleared it

513
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,310
Speaker 4:  And the fact and now that they're converging on the same sort of mediocre

514
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,720
Speaker 4:  like eh, that said Google has

515
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,320
Speaker 4:  new high res maps that it's putting out first in the Volvo X 90, the new

516
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,120
Speaker 4:  EV and in the Polestar three. And so you can see Google's

517
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,920
Speaker 4:  and you know the Volvo and Polestar both use like Android as the

518
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,320
Speaker 4:  infotainment.

519
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

520
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,440
Speaker 4:  Stack. So you can see Google's pushing harder into cars like they're

521
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,760
Speaker 4:  owning more and more acquires they're doing Google built-in. Did we talk

522
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,600
Speaker 4:  about Google built-in on the VER test yet and how deeply confusing it is?

523
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,360
Speaker 5:  Well it's funny because they're redoing the same thing that happened with

524
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,960
Speaker 5:  Android where you have Android and you also have Android with Google

525
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,440
Speaker 5:  services where you can get like Gmail or, or in this case Google Maps and

526
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,290
Speaker 5:  YouTube maybe in the future someday. Yeah. But everybody uses Android

527
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,690
Speaker 5:  but usually it's without Google apps.

528
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,290
Speaker 4:  Right? So like Lanis uses Android but without

529
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,130
Speaker 4:  any Google services. Then Honda just announced a new accord with

530
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,090
Speaker 4:  Google built in, which is something, I

531
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,690
Speaker 3:  Can't believe they're betraying Sony already,

532
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,330
Speaker 4:  But it's something they're running something. But with Google

533
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,770
Speaker 4:  services like Google Maps.

534
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:06,950
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

535
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,190
Speaker 4:  I think GM also has Google Builtin, which is something but with

536
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,070
Speaker 4:  Google Maps but un unclear whether it's Android automotive

537
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,470
Speaker 4:  and then Volvo and Pulse are run Android automotive, which is just Android

538
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,310
Speaker 4:  and plus Google stuff. So now there's just these tiers of like Google

539
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,150
Speaker 4:  being in your car and you can see Google's strategy is basically whatever

540
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,790
Speaker 4:  you want as long as it's us. Whereas Apple's strategy

541
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,590
Speaker 4:  is nothing.

542
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,230
Speaker 3:  Do they have a strategy? Remember we got to see the whole car play

543
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,470
Speaker 3:  just the way you, the exhaustion appeared on your face just then thinking

544
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,870
Speaker 3:  about it that split second of, no I don't want to and

545
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,750
Speaker 4:  Then it's gonna happen. Strategy of what if the front grill of

546
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,590
Speaker 4:  your car showed up to people the weather, which is good. It's

547
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,590
Speaker 4:  not, I mean it's it's a service.

548
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,710
Speaker 3:  It's helpful

549
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:55,470
Speaker 4:  For cars.

550
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,790
Speaker 5:  Where's the Samsung car? Why, why don't we have the Samsung car? Where's

551
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,030
Speaker 4:  That is strange that Samsung has

552
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,030
Speaker 3:  With Bixby in it.

553
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,670
Speaker 4:  Well I mean the the the, you know the the Hyundai group is there with Hyundai

554
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:08,310
Speaker 4:  and Kia and all the rest. Yeah that that's who was supposed to be making

555
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,910
Speaker 4:  the Apple car. You could see Samsung just to walk down the street. Yeah,

556
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,550
Speaker 4:  right there.

557
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,040
Speaker 3:  Well they were, they were busy.

558
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,120
Speaker 4:  Damn. They were busy. There's stuff going on providing the

559
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,030
Speaker 4:  chips to the Sony car that doesn't exist. Okay. That's car stuff. I

560
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,670
Speaker 4:  gotta say we started with the feel just cuz I wanted to get it out of the

561
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,750
Speaker 4:  way. I feel ya. I'm not so much on Twitter anymore but the number of people

562
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,630
Speaker 4:  who tweeted me that we had to talk about AF feel was very high, higher than

563
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,470
Speaker 4:  anything else. But CS a TV show, that's what it's really for.

564
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,150
Speaker 4:  This is, this is where the action happens in the TV world, right.

565
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,030
Speaker 4:  One memory I do have of Cs with Richard is the H T D V D versus

566
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,710
Speaker 4:  Blu-ray c e s, which was incredible where

567
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,670
Speaker 4:  the, this was gonna be the format war year at cs and then before the show

568
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,630
Speaker 4:  started, Toshiba just caved and they tore down the HT D V

569
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:53,910
Speaker 4:  D booth.

570
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,790
Speaker 5:  Wait you could actually see that. You could actually see HT D V D fall apart

571
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,510
Speaker 5:  in real time. In real life in front of I've I've never experienced something

572
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,750
Speaker 5:  like that before Because it was like you, it was like watching a dream die

573
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,590
Speaker 5:  except the dream actually existed.

574
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,630
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It was truly bizarre. But this year CS a little calmer, A

575
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,150
Speaker 4:  lot of TV upgrades, some interesting ideas about picture

576
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,110
Speaker 4:  modes. Like we're in a mature part of a TV cycle, right?

577
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,790
Speaker 4:  We're not insisting Yeah.

578
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,270
Speaker 3:  Like HDR has come. Yeah, they got it. They figured it out.

579
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:23,990
Speaker 3:  Have

580
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,510
Speaker 5:  They figured it

581
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,550
Speaker 3:  Out? We're done. Like they're like okay we know we know what to sell you.

582
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,710
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I mean they, they figured out like they know that their new thing

583
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,630
Speaker 3:  is they can't just force you to buy a new TV because of 4k. So they

584
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,310
Speaker 3:  pivoted to H D R and they've now realized that's not exactly great.

585
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,160
Speaker 3:  So they're just gonna like kind of hang out and and improve the

586
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,240
Speaker 3:  TVs until they figure out some reason to really force you to upgrade

587
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,680
Speaker 3:  again. Like they're all really missing,

588
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,480
Speaker 4:  Which will be 3D again. It's gonna be Avatar two way of water is gonna hit

589
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,960
Speaker 4:  absolutely on streaming and it's gonna be 3D again. I promise you for

590
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,480
Speaker 3:  Like a week,

591
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:00,640
Speaker 4:  If you go back and read some of James Cameron's quotes about Avatar coming

592
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,240
Speaker 4:  out on Blu-ray in 3D and he was like, this shit's the future

593
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,920
Speaker 4:  from back then. Yes he got distracted. Yes, it's been like four decades

594
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,720
Speaker 4:  since that movie came out. But his heart is still pure. He thinks

595
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,400
Speaker 4:  home 3D is gonna happen and Avatar is gonna make it happen again. But it's

596
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,800
Speaker 4:  true, like Alex is saying, we are in a mature part part of the TV cycle.

597
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah hdr like I think Richard, the way I would say it is when

598
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,320
Speaker 4:  Apple caved and added HDR 10 plus to the Apple TV

599
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,600
Speaker 4:  because Samsung wasn't gonna break and add Dolby vision like then you

600
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,280
Speaker 4:  know like all the fights are over, there are no more fights, it's just

601
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,840
Speaker 4:  incremental. But there's still some stuff. Alex ATSC

602
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,720
Speaker 4:  3.0 news your favorite,

603
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,040
Speaker 3:  Very, very exciting news.

604
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,680
Speaker 4:  Can you just tell people what it is?

605
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,120
Speaker 3:  So ATSC 3.0 is the next like broadcasting

606
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,960
Speaker 3:  standard for the four of you and my mom who still watch broadcast tv.

607
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,360
Speaker 3:  I'm surprised she's not watching it in another room right now at her house.

608
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,600
Speaker 3:  It just, it's supposed to be better because you can not only get it

609
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,360
Speaker 3:  through like an antenna but you can get it through 5g.

610
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,600
Speaker 3:  So like you and somebody else can both be sitting together on your

611
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,400
Speaker 3:  couch watching live TV on your phone without having to go through

612
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,600
Speaker 3:  Spectrum or charter or whoever your provider is. Just watching

613
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,520
Speaker 3:  it over the air through 5g. So like theoretically really, really,

614
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,480
Speaker 3:  really, really cool right? But nobody's actually adopting it. There's

615
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,440
Speaker 3:  very few markets that have it. New York City doesn't have it and it's a whole

616
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,280
Speaker 3:  weird complex problem. We'll hopefully talk about more

617
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,920
Speaker 3:  on a future episode of this show. But like I'm in Dallas Fort Worth right

618
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,600
Speaker 3:  now, one of the largest markets in the United States. I think we've got like

619
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,560
Speaker 3:  one station that has it. And it's crazy cuz at T S C 3.0 is like

620
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,040
Speaker 3:  could solve so many problems but everybody's kind of figured out, no we don't

621
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,280
Speaker 3:  wanna do broadcast, we all wanna have our little fems that you pay a subscription

622
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,160
Speaker 3:  for. Yeah. So we're just gonna do that. Suck it. Broadcast slowly die

623
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,080
Speaker 3:  and broadcast is like, okay, ATSC 3.0 we're on 5G now.

624
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,760
Speaker 3:  And so that was the big news. They did a test a couple of weeks ago and they

625
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,480
Speaker 3:  announced it this week that they had like successfully shown off like

626
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,280
Speaker 3:  5G over the air broadcasting in a moving car.

627
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,000
Speaker 3:  Which is like kind of hard to do, right? Like if you've ever had to

628
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,840
Speaker 3:  mess with antennas in your house to watch broadcast tv, now imagine

629
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,200
Speaker 3:  doing that while driving 60 miles per hour down the highway. That's like

630
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,040
Speaker 3:  not easy to do. So it is kind of impressive technology but

631
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,960
Speaker 3:  the fact that none of the markets are adopting it is bad.

632
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah, well because all those local news stations are getting sucked up into

633
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean there's an entire like media ownership crisis.

634
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,440
Speaker 3:  Well it was interesting cuz one of the biggest ones was Sinclair. And Sinclair

635
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,120
Speaker 3:  was actually part of this big announcement. So they like Sinclair who's who

636
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,840
Speaker 3:  kind of has bought a lot of these broadcast stations, they're very committed

637
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,360
Speaker 3:  to like ATSC 3.0 but also it's Sinclair

638
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,440
Speaker 3:  who has a lot of issues.

639
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,400
Speaker 4:  They're yeah, they're also committed to not spending money.

640
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So we'll see. Come on it guys, you can do it.

641
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,400
Speaker 4:  I'm pretty sure there's one ATSC 3.0 broadcaster by my,

642
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,200
Speaker 4:  my house up in the woods and they have chosen to use the additional bandwidth

643
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,640
Speaker 4:  not for higher picture quality, but to shove more infomercials.

644
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,160
Speaker 4:  Yes. In like sub-channel of infomercials. It's very good.

645
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,320
Speaker 3:  Yeah, that was, that was part of it. They were like, oh yeah, we can do so

646
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Speaker 3:  many more channels on a channel so you can get a lot more advertising. And

647
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,640
Speaker 3:  I was like, is that a good thing? And they're like, oh

648
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's not a good thing. All right, let's talk about some actual TVs.

649
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:24,080
Speaker 4:  LG had a bunch of TVs. I actually wanna start not with their weird wireless

650
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,560
Speaker 4:  TV we can talk about for a minute, but with this picture modes thing. So

651
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:31,960
Speaker 4:  if you'll remember LG owns web os I feel like every year at CS is just

652
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,760
Speaker 4:  me recapitulating the last 20 years of tech history. So there was,

653
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,840
Speaker 4:  there was some

654
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,360
Speaker 5:  Webs isn't dead, it's still here like that. That we should celebrate that.

655
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,840
Speaker 5:  We should celebrate that effort. It should be a holiday, a national

656
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,600
Speaker 4:  Holiday. It's true. So the Palm Prix was announced

657
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,800
Speaker 4:  at, what am I doing?

658
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,920
Speaker 4:  In 2008 the Palm Prix was announced ats Mattias

659
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,800
Speaker 4:  Duarte who is now works at Google, is out of design of

660
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,760
Speaker 4:  of Android and Google. He announced the Palm Prix along with this

661
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,640
Speaker 4:  new system called Web os. You might have heard of it if you have ever listened

662
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,520
Speaker 4:  to this show before many things happened, including the complete collapse

663
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,720
Speaker 4:  of Hewlett Packard

664
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,600
Speaker 4:  And Web Os somehow ended up in the hands of lg,

665
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,720
Speaker 4:  which used it not to make phones but to put on their

666
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,720
Speaker 4:  TVs. And their whole thing was they needed their own. Basically TV

667
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,200
Speaker 4:  apps are all HTML five apps. Yeah. So they needed their own stack to run

668
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:32,120
Speaker 4:  HTML five apps. TV world by the way, is still the most fragmented technology

669
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,920
Speaker 4:  landscape in the entire like ecosystem. Like phones, like

670
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,600
Speaker 4:  Android and iOS laptops are like Mac Os,

671
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,840
Speaker 4:  windows and little Linux TVs are, Samsung has ties

672
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,600
Speaker 4:  in, LG has web os, a bunch of people have Android

673
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,280
Speaker 4:  from Google. A bunch of people have Android without Google. A bunch of people

674
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,800
Speaker 4:  have Roku and then there's like yet more infinity

675
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,800
Speaker 4:  craziness. VIO runs its own weird thing. So TVs are totally all

676
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,040
Speaker 4:  over the place. They all run basically HTML five apps. LG buys

677
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,440
Speaker 4:  Web West. Their big thing is they introduced a character. This is a true

678
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,280
Speaker 4:  story. Etsy S called Bean Bird.

679
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,200
Speaker 3:  No,

680
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,040
Speaker 4:  Who is gonna help you? This is true. This is real. Who's gonna help you set

681
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,960
Speaker 4:  up your tv? And the idea was that your TV was too hard to use and Bean

682
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,320
Speaker 4:  bird would help you. They've held on to this idea.

683
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,520
Speaker 4:  Bean bird may have disappeared, but the idea that the TV should be more

684
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,720
Speaker 4:  helpful and LG can help you set it up and then target more advertising to

685
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,360
Speaker 4:  you has persisted. Thank you lg. So now they've got this thing where instead

686
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,080
Speaker 4:  of doing picture modes, when you turn on your LG tv, it's gonna

687
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:38,000
Speaker 4:  show you images on the screen and then you then you can like click through

688
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,510
Speaker 4:  them and tell 'em which ones you like and then that will adjust your picture

689
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,110
Speaker 4:  settings and this is gonna result.

690
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,430
Speaker 5:  So it's like going to the eye doctor.

691
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,070
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's the eye doctor. Which one do you like better? This one or the,

692
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,670
Speaker 4:  like you go look at the pictures on our, our side, you can see it. And this

693
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,310
Speaker 4:  is gonna result in the most bonkers, insane

694
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,550
Speaker 4:  picture settings on grandparents TVs of all time.

695
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,230
Speaker 4:  Like it's gonna be so bad, fully blown out hall highlights, massive contrast,

696
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,950
Speaker 4:  brightness, crank to oblivion.

697
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,590
Speaker 3:  It's gonna be the worst thing in the world. Like right now,

698
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,870
Speaker 3:  I'm, I'm watching a show I can't talk about yet on a, it's coming out on

699
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:17,670
Speaker 3:  H B O, it's beautiful touching story of a, a dad and

700
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,110
Speaker 3:  his surrogate daughter. And it is so damn

701
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,030
Speaker 3:  dark and every day my mom's watching it with me and she's like, this is dark.

702
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,070
Speaker 3:  I can't see anything. Can we turn the brightness up? And I refuse to allow

703
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,670
Speaker 3:  it because I've already calibrated her TV and I'm like, no, this is what

704
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,350
Speaker 3:  they intended and this is just gonna ruin the creator's intent. It's super

705
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,830
Speaker 3:  sad. Wow. But it's also, I guess it'll make people happier

706
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,030
Speaker 3:  with their sets. I know that our, our producer Liam was talking about

707
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,630
Speaker 5:  Will any of the automatic settings turn off the soap opera quick? Because

708
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,030
Speaker 5:  I feel like the answer is no. The, the TV manufacturers are just decided

709
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,070
Speaker 5:  that's how you're going to live unless you go in and

710
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,830
Speaker 4:  Change this. No, no. They have, they have film mode now. They gave Tom cruiser

711
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:54,990
Speaker 4:  mode.

712
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,990
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I hope it shows them a clip when they're having to

713
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,630
Speaker 3:  select. They're like, which one looks nicer to you? Minions

714
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,350
Speaker 3:  two in superfast soap opera mode or not.

715
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,470
Speaker 3:  And I hope they all choose the soap opera mode.

716
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,630
Speaker 4:  I think we're about to learn that one. LG is collecting a

717
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,070
Speaker 4:  ton of data with this feature. I mean LG is the worst offender when it comes

718
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,830
Speaker 4:  to running ads in their TVs. By far the worst. They're gonna have the da,

719
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,270
Speaker 4:  they're gonna be armed in the next meeting with like Tom Cruise and Christopher Nolan

720
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,670
Speaker 4:  that people like the Snow opera effect. And two, I think we're gonna learn

721
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,390
Speaker 4:  that people have just bonkers taste when it comes to picture quality.

722
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,710
Speaker 4:  So yeah, they need the reference modes, which they, they're starting to add,

723
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,030
Speaker 4:  but then they're, they're doing this new thing where people get, I mean you

724
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,190
Speaker 4:  should just pick, it's called the personalized picture wizard and it's gonna

725
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,670
Speaker 4:  show you six images and like step you through eight times

726
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,830
Speaker 4:  and you pick the one you like and there's AI involved and

727
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,030
Speaker 4:  a lot of TVs are gonna look completely insane.

728
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,110
Speaker 3:  What I don't get is why they don't just set everything in like

729
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,110
Speaker 3:  cinema mode, which is calibrated to, to be

730
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:02,070
Speaker 3:  exactly like what the calibration specs for all the people making it do and

731
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,510
Speaker 3:  then just change the brightness

732
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,550
Speaker 4:  Because people have bad taste.

733
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,030
Speaker 3:  Yeah, but like don't let them have taste.

734
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,470
Speaker 4:  All right

735
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,230
Speaker 3:  Steve Trucks remove options. Just be like, no

736
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,910
Speaker 4:  You're, I want you to do, I want you to charge your mouse on the bottom.

737
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,070
Speaker 4:  I know what's best for you.

738
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,790
Speaker 3:  I'm not asking that. I'm just saying, you know what, it's supposed

739
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,590
Speaker 3:  to look a little yellow.

740
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,950
Speaker 4:  All right. We should talk about other TVs. It is supposed to look a little

741
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,550
Speaker 4:  you. You're correct. Yeah. People want bright and blue.

742
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,270
Speaker 3:  I hate them.

743
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,870
Speaker 5:  It's exactly what we're talking about. So, and exactly what Alex is talking

744
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:34,630
Speaker 5:  about, Samsung with their new TVs, they've got luminal mode now.

745
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,600
Speaker 5:  Now we like we've talked about the settings, but this is like a, a technology

746
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,120
Speaker 5:  that they're building that it translates from Latin to return the light

747
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,640
Speaker 5:  that uses Samsung AI of course to dynamically outline the

748
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,440
Speaker 5:  edges of onscreen elements and rebalance colors. It's supposed to be supposed

749
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,000
Speaker 5:  to help people with low vision, but as you said, you're going to come to

750
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,880
Speaker 5:  your parents' house and you're gonna find out that they have this thing on

751
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,480
Speaker 5:  and you are going to see something that you have never even imagined could

752
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,760
Speaker 5:  exist on a display luminal mode. You're

753
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,520
Speaker 4:  Welcome. This is because we're all home from the holidays. We're all dealing

754
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,000
Speaker 4:  with it. But it's there. It never stops. It never goes away. I turned off

755
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,240
Speaker 4:  motion smoothing on a TV that I personally turned off motion smoothing two

756
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,160
Speaker 4:  years ago and it just came back and they denied it. They

757
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,840
Speaker 4:  said, we don't even watch this tv. And I said, now it's back and Lumino mode

758
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Speaker 4:  is coming. We should talk about this wireless LG tv.

759
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:27,240
Speaker 4:  This makes no sense to me. So it's super expensive. It has

760
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,600
Speaker 4:  a breakout HTMI box. So you mount TV in your wall, it's got a super thin

761
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,760
Speaker 4:  power cord and then somewhere else in your room

762
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,480
Speaker 4:  you plug everything into this box which then transmits

763
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,120
Speaker 4:  wirelessly to this tv.

764
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,040
Speaker 3:  It's for the aesthetic.

765
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,720
Speaker 4:  I mean it's a 97 inch screen. We're assuming it will be

766
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,560
Speaker 4:  extremely expensive. The last time LG showed off a concept ago, this TV itself

767
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,480
Speaker 4:  was like a hundred thousand dollars In the end. I'm just saying if you have

768
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,800
Speaker 4:  the money for the intense concept, 97 inch

769
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,600
Speaker 4:  tv, that still needs power. You still have to hide

770
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,560
Speaker 4:  the power cable. Do you not have the money to hide another cable?

771
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,240
Speaker 3:  I think this is like they're just doing a really nice service for installers

772
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,760
Speaker 3:  who are realistically the people setting these TVs

773
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,640
Speaker 3:  up. Right? Like if you're spending the money to buy a 97 inch TV for

774
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,120
Speaker 3:  however much, this is gonna be thousands and thousands of dollars, you're

775
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,000
Speaker 3:  probably paying an installer to come in and install it and make it all look

776
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,240
Speaker 3:  pretty in your house. And this is just nice for those installers because

777
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,280
Speaker 3:  instead of having to like hide a whole bunch of cords, they have to hide

778
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,560
Speaker 3:  a cord,

779
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,120
Speaker 4:  One cord,

780
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,720
Speaker 3:  One cord, one

781
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,560
Speaker 4:  One cord

782
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,560
Speaker 3:  And it's, that's one less than Samsung on their old high-end

783
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,720
Speaker 3:  TVs which had the breakout box and like the fiber optic cord.

784
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,960
Speaker 5:  I'm just confused because didn't we do this already with like all those wide

785
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,400
Speaker 5:  eye demos we went to 10 years ago?

786
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah, but this is bad. I mean this is, they're sending 4K 1 20, 30

787
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,600
Speaker 4:  feet wirelessly, which is insane. Yeah.

788
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,960
Speaker 5:  The video would've been compressed then. This is uncompressed pure, it's

789
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,520
Speaker 5:  processed in the box. The only thing on the screen is the display and no

790
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,440
Speaker 5:  electronics or whatever. It's paper thin. Right?

791
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I can't wait to see what happens when your kid is like microwaving

792
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,160
Speaker 3:  some hot wings while you're watching a football game and it just craps

793
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,320
Speaker 3:  out.

794
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I don't trust anything wireless as I think our readers know.

795
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,960
Speaker 3:  But I, I think it's, I think it's cool. Like I think if you can bring

796
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,760
Speaker 3:  this, we've started to see Samsung slowly bring this like breakout box

797
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,640
Speaker 3:  idea down into more affordable products. I say more

798
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,720
Speaker 3:  affordable. I mean like, what was it, the $3,000,

799
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,400
Speaker 4:  The frame TV was on sale for 800 bucks. This, this last

800
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,280
Speaker 3:  Black credit. Yeah, they, they they've, they brought those prices down and

801
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,680
Speaker 3:  if you could do that, the same with this, I personally would never do it

802
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,120
Speaker 3:  because I love wires, but for a lot of people, those people who like, like

803
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,640
Speaker 3:  to put their TV over their fireplace, even though you should never ever do

804
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,080
Speaker 3:  that. This is like a dream come true.

805
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,040
Speaker 4:  But you still have to run power. If you have to run a power cable, you

806
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,680
Speaker 4:  can run one H D M I cable.

807
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,320
Speaker 3:  Yeah, but what about their Xbox and their PS five

808
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,920
Speaker 4:  But that cable just, you run it into the breakout box, like the frame tv,

809
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,720
Speaker 4:  you connect everything.

810
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,640
Speaker 3:  So you're just saying we should just have the breakout box.

811
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean that's what most TVs, they've just eliminated the cable from

812
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,320
Speaker 4:  the tv, the panel to the breakout box.

813
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,120
Speaker 3:  I know, but like there was a long time where people were like, why do I need

814
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,960
Speaker 3:  cordless headphones? They're bad and stupid and they still are and

815
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,960
Speaker 3:  people still love it.

816
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,280
Speaker 4:  We just did an entire episode on Bluetooth, Alex.

817
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,600
Speaker 3:  I know. And as everyone, everyone listening knows I know nothing about

818
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,320
Speaker 3:  Bluetooth. Nothing.

819
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:28,080
Speaker 4:  No, I'm just saying like the, the limitations I I just don't get it.

820
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. If you have a hundred thousand dollars to put this TV

821
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,680
Speaker 4:  on your wall and you've gotta run power, what does

822
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,560
Speaker 4:  the breakout box get you?

823
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,960
Speaker 3:  One less wire.

824
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,280
Speaker 4:  One less wire.

825
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,160
Speaker 5:  You can play physical games without getting off the couch. You can

826
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,080
Speaker 5:  have everything, everything you've ever wanted. You can have your, your physical

827
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,640
Speaker 5:  media archives but you don't have to get off the couch to change the movie

828
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,160
Speaker 5:  of the game. It's, it's perfect. What could be better?

829
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:58,040
Speaker 3:  So you just have a big like tower next to your couch. It's gonna be great.

830
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,640
Speaker 3:  The future

831
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,440
Speaker 5:  When we're all still using this.

832
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,920
Speaker 4:  That said, we dunno what the input lag, they won't say what the input lag

833
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,800
Speaker 4:  is. Other, we'll just quickly go through some other stuff. Roku

834
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,520
Speaker 4:  announced its own TV line. The only thing I wanna point out here, this makes

835
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,640
Speaker 4:  sense. Roku's been making TVs in partnership with TCL for years now. They're

836
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,920
Speaker 4:  just putting their own branding on TVs. TVs seem like they're gonna be one

837
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,720
Speaker 4:  step down from TCLs TVs and just like the, they, they

838
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,400
Speaker 4:  won't talk about specs and that usually means the specs aren't gonna be top

839
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,200
Speaker 4:  of the line specs, right?

840
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,500
Speaker 3:  Yeah. They'll be cheap.

841
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,780
Speaker 4:  Yeah, they will be cheap. Chris Waltz wrote this up for us. He noted that

842
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,340
Speaker 4:  the person in charge of Roku's TV efforts, former TCL

843
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,740
Speaker 4:  executive Chris Larson. So they're just keeping that in the family. This

844
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,620
Speaker 4:  feels like gm, like some things are a Buick and some things are a Chevy

845
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,820
Speaker 4:  but they're all the same car. It seems like what's happening with, because

846
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,060
Speaker 4:  Roku's not making the TVs. They're definitely rebranding something. So it's

847
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,820
Speaker 4:  TCL or Hiene or whatever, who knows? But my guess is

848
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,500
Speaker 3:  Insignia,

849
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,620
Speaker 4:  Insignia is also rebranded, whatever.

850
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:54,380
Speaker 3:  Damn

851
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,500
Speaker 4:  It. Yeah. Insignias is the best Buy house brand I think

852
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,620
Speaker 3:  Whatever, whatever the insignia, what whoever they go to, that's who Roku

853
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:01,820
Speaker 3:  went

854
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,620
Speaker 4:  To. That's who Roku went to. Speaking of tcl, they've got new

855
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,500
Speaker 4:  branding. They're, they have much higher specs and they're

856
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:13,460
Speaker 4:  totally, they have decided that gamers are their market, which I think

857
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,340
Speaker 4:  is pretty interesting actually because we, I think we've, we have people

858
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,180
Speaker 4:  on this on our staff. We definitely, people like this on Polyon staff. The

859
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,460
Speaker 4:  number of people who in the pandemic now have like multiple TVs in their

860
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,940
Speaker 4:  living room. So they can game side by side is fascinating to me.

861
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,740
Speaker 4:  Richard just gave a very knowing look after the side of this room,

862
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,120
Speaker 5:  I, there are two TVs behind me for no.

863
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,280
Speaker 4:  So I think that's fascinating. And then Razor made a sound bar

864
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:43,120
Speaker 4:  that tracks your head in the room for, I mean this is gonna sound horrible,

865
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,760
Speaker 4:  but they've made a sound bar with IR trackers like a connect to figure out

866
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,080
Speaker 4:  where your head is and then do surround sound based on where your head is

867
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,560
Speaker 4:  in the room. N neither do you sound convinced by this?

868
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,520
Speaker 3:  I, I had, I had the original Leviathan and then I broke the,

869
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,520
Speaker 3:  one of the cords on it and they couldn't, they were like, no, we don't sell,

870
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,720
Speaker 3:  we don't have replacements for that. I even went to like the PR guy. I did

871
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,200
Speaker 3:  like the thing that you should never do as a journalist. And I was like,

872
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,480
Speaker 3:  do you know if, if you guys make these replacement cords because I personally

873
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,880
Speaker 3:  want one. And he's like, no we don't. I can get you one. And I was like,

874
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,800
Speaker 3:  no, I I'm not gonna take one that you like just go and take out of another

875
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,520
Speaker 3:  box. You should just make these. So I, I'm, I'm I'm over

876
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,120
Speaker 3:  razor soundbars.

877
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well this one is looking for your head with infrared. Yeah.

878
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,880
Speaker 3:  Even more over this particular

879
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,880
Speaker 4:  One and it will find you. We actually didn't talk about Samsung. Samsung

880
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:33,200
Speaker 4:  as always announced a ton of TVs and Chris Welch

881
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,960
Speaker 4:  I think dropped this story into Slack when he was done writing. He was like,

882
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,800
Speaker 4:  this is Eli's nightmare. Samsung is like all in

883
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:43,600
Speaker 4:  on AI picture tricks all in on remapping

884
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,280
Speaker 4:  SDR to H D R content. All in on more

885
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,040
Speaker 4:  processing enhancements just in general.

886
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,560
Speaker 4:  We've like hit the point where the panels are all pretty good and so

887
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,480
Speaker 4:  now all the effort to differentiate the panels is happening on the backend

888
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,160
Speaker 4:  and software and yeah, I would say well it's just correct. This feels like

889
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,920
Speaker 4:  my nightmare cuz it's all just weird processing tricks across the board.

890
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:09,760
Speaker 4:  Turn it off. All I really want is just show me the movie

891
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,280
Speaker 4:  as it was intended to be seen.

892
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,240
Speaker 3:  Please.

893
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,000
Speaker 5:  What if we didn't do that?

894
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:18,840
Speaker 4:  Auto HD R Remastering uses AI deep learning technology to analyze

895
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,680
Speaker 4:  and apply realtime HDR effects on standard dynamic range content on a scene

896
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,640
Speaker 4:  by scene basis. It's like

897
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,320
Speaker 3:  I don't want that,

898
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,840
Speaker 4:  I really don't want you to do that. But people love really bright pictures.

899
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,680
Speaker 4:  We'll see how it goes. See you know Samsung now is like everywhere,

900
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,360
Speaker 4:  right? They're making standard LCDs. They're making micro LEDs and they're

901
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,000
Speaker 4:  making ods.

902
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,800
Speaker 3:  Yeah, they're like just a full stack. Yeah. Are they good?

903
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,440
Speaker 3:  Do you wanna own one for more than a year remains to be seen.

904
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,000
Speaker 4:  Here's my question. Is this final, like I have a

905
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,640
Speaker 4:  early, I think a B seven <unk> six lg

906
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,280
Speaker 4:  It's totally fine.

907
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:54,600
Speaker 3:  This the year,

908
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,280
Speaker 4:  You think this is the year?

909
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,160
Speaker 3:  This is the year because I have a B seven and I don't wanna be alone when

910
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,720
Speaker 3:  I go and upgrade mine. So do it. Eli

911
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,040
Speaker 5:  Welch gave you the, the reason the he, he gave you the reason to get the,

912
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,720
Speaker 5:  the new one this year. The one thing that we haven't talked about. What if,

913
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,440
Speaker 5:  what if they had had a software upgrade that was good? There's something

914
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,120
Speaker 5:  that changed in Web West that he does. Like the way the notifications pop

915
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,080
Speaker 5:  up. Oh so it they not

916
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,000
Speaker 5:  everything is bad or the worst and some of the H D M I 2.1 features.

917
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,120
Speaker 5:  Maybe they'll even work this year. Yeah, we'll have hope.

918
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:28,200
Speaker 4:  I have hope. You gotta at least wait for QD OED to

919
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:28,440
Speaker 4:  like

920
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,160
Speaker 1:  Actually spread out. Like so far it's just Sony with their highest end model,

921
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,040
Speaker 1:  which I know they bought from LG display but like not even

922
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,040
Speaker 1:  LG is making a TV with QD O lead yet. I would, I would wait for

923
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,200
Speaker 1:  that.

924
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,960
Speaker 3:  I'm just gonna get a reference monitor.

925
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah it's just like this TV's definitely good enough and I mostly watch like

926
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,560
Speaker 4:  ultra compressed streaming content like you know

927
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,040
Speaker 4:  it's

928
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,240
Speaker 3:  Fine.

929
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,680
Speaker 4:  All right. Alex put together a plex server of only the finest

930
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,480
Speaker 4:  uncompressed blue hair rips.

931
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:57,520
Speaker 3:  I got

932
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,360
Speaker 5:  You. We're gonna be watching Big Bunny for hours

933
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,600
Speaker 3:  All will they all be from the 1930s Probably.

934
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:06,560
Speaker 4:  We the public domain with Alex Grant.

935
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,360
Speaker 4:  Very good. There were look there was a bunch of other CS display stuff. Samsung

936
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,040
Speaker 4:  had a bunch of Rolly Foldy displays, lots of prototypes.

937
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:18,360
Speaker 4:  Hard to talk

938
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,720
Speaker 5:  Dell six K.

939
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,160
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, there actually a bunch of people came at the pro display. Xdr,

940
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:27,200
Speaker 4:  Dell and Samsung. Samsung K

941
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,600
Speaker 4:  5K display. Dell had the 32 inch 6k. That's pretty cool.

942
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,960
Speaker 4:  It's neat to see a little competition in there. Like I said, CS is display

943
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,880
Speaker 4:  show, so go look on the site. It's hard to talk about displays especially

944
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,720
Speaker 4:  go look at all the Samsung prototypes cause they're cool as hell. They're

945
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,320
Speaker 4:  just not products and I think the TV market is super mature. Yeah,

946
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,200
Speaker 4:  like the answer is like if you want a tv, they're, you're not waiting for

947
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,320
Speaker 4:  anything better right now, like you might as well, which is how I justify

948
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,440
Speaker 4:  all multi-thousand dollars purchases. It's

949
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,880
Speaker 3:  Gonna be a huge game changer. Next year

950
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,320
Speaker 5:  We need the new TV because it will have the NFT app store. We're going crypto

951
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,200
Speaker 5:  this year. That's my, that's my goal. I'm going to sell all of you

952
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,800
Speaker 5:  tokens. We're going to do this together. We're not going to let crypto, we're

953
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,120
Speaker 5:  not going to let

954
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,040
Speaker 3:  The fire sale on FTX tokens. Go stock up, Richard.

955
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,960
Speaker 5:  Well, once the marketplace is reopened in, we can access thing. Yes, we

956
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,160
Speaker 5:  we're having a little problem, but it'll be fine.

957
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,120
Speaker 4:  Alright. Like I said, see has a display show lots of TV news. Chris

958
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,040
Speaker 4:  Welcher's done an amazing job. If you want all the details on the stuff,

959
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,680
Speaker 4:  go read his coverage. Go look at the tos of displays folding.

960
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:30,920
Speaker 4:  We gotta take a break. We can come back. There's still more. There's desktop,

961
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,240
Speaker 4:  there's laptops. I'm sure Richard will find a way to make that about crypto

962
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,560
Speaker 4:  too. We'll be right back.

963
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,630

977
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,610
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. There's still more CS stuff to talk about.

978
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,090
Speaker 4:  It does feel like I'm a little drunk, you know, I'm not, get a little

979
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:41,730
Speaker 4:  but just

980
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,450
Speaker 3:  Little vodka

981
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:46,530
Speaker 4:  Talking about gadgets in Vegas for long enough. You get a little, takes you

982
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:46,650
Speaker 4:  to

983
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,890
Speaker 3:  A place, get a little tipsy,

984
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:48,970
Speaker 4:  Get a little out there.

985
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,170
Speaker 3:  Suddenly you're just smelling cigarette smoke and you don't know why you're

986
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:52,690
Speaker 3:  having a great time.

987
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,330
Speaker 4:  I got a, a text from an unnamed former colleague

988
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,410
Speaker 4:  and all it said was, I'm jonesing for a Juul.

989
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,650
Speaker 4:  And I realize that I was, and I have it in years

990
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:07,970
Speaker 4:  and it's just, I think my body expects nicotine in early

991
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:10,570
Speaker 4:  January. Yeah. Because of cs.

992
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,890
Speaker 3:  It's just gotten used

993
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:15,330
Speaker 4:  To it. It's just, this is when you smoke, bro. Like

994
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,410
Speaker 4:  where are we at,

995
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,330
Speaker 3:  Liam? What are you doing? Just vaping furiously.

996
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:23,320
Speaker 4:  That's horrible. Don't vape kids. Don't listen to us. Turn this off.

997
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,000
Speaker 4:  Get out of your car and run away from us a md Announce

998
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,960
Speaker 4:  a bunch of stuff. Alex, take us through it.

999
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,040
Speaker 3:  Yeah, they announced a lot of stuff amd this is kind of a big show for them

1000
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,080
Speaker 3:  and they usually save some really big stuff for it. One of the big things

1001
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,720
Speaker 3:  they announced is like a really fast mobile gpu.

1002
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,320
Speaker 3:  The RX 7,600 M it's expected this

1003
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,400
Speaker 3:  year in 2023. And they're promising basically

1004
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:52,160
Speaker 3:  Nvidia 30 60 desktop performance

1005
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:56,240
Speaker 3:  in a laptop, which is like really, really nice.

1006
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,360
Speaker 3:  We're, we're not right quite at like 4K a hundred frames per

1007
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,240
Speaker 3:  second, but we're definitely at that for 10 80 p So, which is

1008
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,560
Speaker 3:  what a lot of laptops are at right now. So this is like

1009
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,840
Speaker 3:  gonna be pretty fast. It's a nice bonus, but we don't know

1010
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:16,160
Speaker 3:  what that power consumption is gonna look like and just how

1011
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,000
Speaker 3:  much battery life these things are gonna crush. I predict

1012
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,840
Speaker 3:  a lot. Yeah. AMD's gotten a lot better at this, but they're still

1013
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,800
Speaker 3:  not like, they're not Apple. Apple is just schooling everybody when it

1014
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,680
Speaker 3:  comes to power and, and performance. But,

1015
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,680
Speaker 4:  But not necessarily on the GPU side.

1016
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,600
Speaker 3:  Yeah, but I mean kind of even in the GPU side, right? Like

1017
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,720
Speaker 3:  it's not at the same level and, and Apple GPU is not gonna

1018
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,440
Speaker 3:  ever give you the same performance or an Apple chip isn't gonna give you

1019
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,520
Speaker 3:  the same performance as one of these discreet graphics chips, but

1020
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,960
Speaker 3:  it's still like the, the power consumption is still gonna be problem. This

1021
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,800
Speaker 3:  is still probably not gonna be a 10 hour laptop, right? I mean,

1022
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,800
Speaker 3:  I hope it is, but I I highly doubt it. And then the other, the

1023
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,520
Speaker 3:  other big news was new CPUs all

1024
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,600
Speaker 3:  Yeah. New mobile processors. This is, they've got including one that's

1025
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,120
Speaker 3:  got a 16 core chip, which isn't quite as many

1026
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,960
Speaker 3:  as one of the newer Intel mobile processors, which has a 24

1027
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,320
Speaker 3:  core chip. And it's very, but it is very funny because these guys are still

1028
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,160
Speaker 3:  talking about cores and apples over here being like, no, we don't even

1029
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,000
Speaker 3:  have to talk about that anymore. We've moved beyond that. Like, sorry, I'm

1030
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,880
Speaker 3:  just, I'm using a MD time to stand about Apple and I feel really bad about

1031
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,520
Speaker 3:  it. But the Apple,

1032
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,680
Speaker 4:  You're gonna get called out for this.

1033
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,640
Speaker 3:  I, I am, but the processors are good.

1034
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,400
Speaker 5:  Well, I mean it's, it's interesting what they're doing here because it, it's

1035
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,040
Speaker 5:  only 16 cores, but it's not like Intel's kind of big little

1036
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,240
Speaker 5:  arm star arm style approach they're using on the new chips. Like they're

1037
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,160
Speaker 5:  all 16 are are all big cores I guess, or like two, it's like

1038
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,040
Speaker 5:  two full eight core chips squeezed into one is, is what is described

1039
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,240
Speaker 5:  as.

1040
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:56,480
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. I think we're starting to, I think what we're gonna, we're

1041
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,280
Speaker 3:  we're starting to see and we're gonna continue to see is that a m d

1042
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,040
Speaker 3:  has gotten a lot of work out of infinity

1043
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,040
Speaker 3:  fabric, right? Like they've gotten a lot of play over the last six years

1044
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,000
Speaker 3:  out of infinity fabric, which has let them to just bolt GPUs and CPUs

1045
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,000
Speaker 3:  together just bolt core after core after core onto these processors and

1046
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,870
Speaker 3:  get a lot of power. And everybody else has

1047
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:21,470
Speaker 3:  really started to pivot in this other direction, this big little core. And

1048
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:25,390
Speaker 3:  AMD is doing a little bit of that too across the board, but they're a little

1049
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,910
Speaker 3:  behind. I'm, I'm kind of worried. I, I know they've talked a number of people

1050
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:32,670
Speaker 3:  have talked to Lisa Sue, the CEO being like, are you guys

1051
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,590
Speaker 3:  falling behind again? Are we about to see, are we gonna get another bulldozer

1052
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:40,510
Speaker 3:  in a year or two? And obviously she's saying no, they're not going

1053
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,910
Speaker 3:  to drop the ball catastrophically. And we're seeing

1054
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:48,230
Speaker 3:  a lot of work like good work in that mobile space, right? Like this steam

1055
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,790
Speaker 3:  deck uses an AMD processor and their

1056
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:55,430
Speaker 3:  laptops have gotten a lot better, but they still get a lot of catching up

1057
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:58,910
Speaker 3:  to do. I would say they're still better than Intel for the most part. Like

1058
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:02,030
Speaker 3:  these processors are still gonna be faster if you can find them in a product

1059
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,990
Speaker 3:  than the Intel processors. But a lot of people are really going, no,

1060
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:09,590
Speaker 3:  I want something that is fast and has really good battery life. I don't necessarily

1061
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,470
Speaker 3:  care about having the fastest thing in the world in a mobile

1062
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:15,990
Speaker 5:  Check. And how will they find it with these names? Yeah, because I feel like

1063
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:18,870
Speaker 5:  we haven't got enough credit. They changed the naming scheme for the processors

1064
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:19,630
Speaker 5:  this year. Oh

1065
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,350
Speaker 3:  My god. You, you don't like the names.

1066
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,510
Speaker 5:  So everything is a 7,000 series this year and then the

1067
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:29,470
Speaker 5:  the third number tells you how good it is and not the first

1068
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,350
Speaker 5:  number like it used to be.

1069
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:30,750
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1070
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,310
Speaker 5:  Like you have, you have to read a chart to figure out what the numbers mean

1071
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:34,910
Speaker 5:  now. Yeah.

1072
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:38,550
Speaker 4:  Everything is a, I'll just read from Monica's post here.

1073
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:42,750
Speaker 4:  The potential star of the show is the quote dragon range Zen four

1074
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:45,870
Speaker 4:  risen 9 79 45 HX

1075
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,070
Speaker 4:  rolls

1076
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,790
Speaker 5:  Right off the, their new naming scheme. I

1077
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:52,670
Speaker 3:  Mean change, that's the way they've always done it though. No, I, yes.

1078
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:53,230
Speaker 4:  This is what

1079
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:55,990
Speaker 3:  They've changed. Make sure this is the same naming scheme, right? They've

1080
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,750
Speaker 3:  always had the first numbers, the generation,

1081
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:01,030
Speaker 5:  They changed the, it's always been numbers like this, but they changed the

1082
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,910
Speaker 5:  way that the numbers go. It's still four letters and then it's still four

1083
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,790
Speaker 5:  numbers and then a letter. But the, it's the first number is the portfolio

1084
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:11,470
Speaker 5:  year. So it's seven this year for 2023. The second number is market

1085
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:15,350
Speaker 5:  segment. So like the most powerful ones are nine. One is

1086
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:19,190
Speaker 5:  the one that you shouldn't buy. The third number is the Zen architecture.

1087
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:23,110
Speaker 5:  So like one, two, or three. And then the fourth number is, I, I

1088
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,240
Speaker 5:  don't know what that fourth number is. I, I don't know. Feature isolation.

1089
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,240
Speaker 5:  You I I'm done. I I've got nothing.

1090
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,360
Speaker 3:  It's a five.

1091
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:33,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's deeply confusing. And the good news is

1092
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,440
Speaker 4:  the people who buy the chips directly to install

1093
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,000
Speaker 4:  in PCs directly will figure it out. Right? If you're, if you're out there

1094
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,880
Speaker 4:  just like buying bare CPUs, you're gonna, you're gonna figure this out.

1095
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,760
Speaker 5:  Maybe AMD had some problems with the wrong names on their

1096
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,560
Speaker 5:  CPUs during the press conference. As Tom Warren noted, they repeatedly

1097
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,520
Speaker 5:  called them the wrong thing. So what's driven laptop you get no

1098
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,240
Speaker 4:  Assurances. So AMD it's, but by, hopefully by the time they arrive on

1099
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,280
Speaker 4:  store shelves or your favorite online retailer, they'll figure it out. They'll

1100
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,920
Speaker 4:  be charts, whatever. It's the companies, it's the

1101
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,480
Speaker 4:  OEMs need to figure this out and then market the chips appropriately. At

1102
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,960
Speaker 4:  the same time, I think, is this a MD chip faster than that Intel chip?

1103
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,680
Speaker 4:  Impossible for the regular person to know at this moment in time. Especially

1104
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,280
Speaker 4:  TAs explain

1105
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,640
Speaker 3:  About that. Well, impossible to even test. Yeah. Like for the mobile chips,

1106
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,480
Speaker 3:  it's kind of, it's a tossup cuz you can't do just an apple

1107
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,160
Speaker 3:  to apples. Nobody's gonna be making the exact same laptop and just

1108
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,640
Speaker 3:  switching out processors anymore.

1109
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:32,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That said, enough of the laptops at CS are basically using the same

1110
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,600
Speaker 4:  chips and the same that like the features that we're

1111
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,360
Speaker 4:  competing on it, which it very much echoes the, the TV conversation.

1112
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,720
Speaker 4:  Like everything has gotten to a place of like being good enough for Sammy

1113
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,280
Speaker 4:  enough that we're now differentiating on absolutely bonkers features.

1114
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,120
Speaker 4:  Which brings me, sorry, I just, I I can't be talking about

1115
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,160
Speaker 4:  rising chips. When Lenovo was out there, Lenovo

1116
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,680
Speaker 4:  has a bunch of stuff. Lenovo has a new think book which with modular accessories

1117
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,240
Speaker 4:  like an LTE module, webcam, light, all this other stuff. A cool new all in

1118
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,960
Speaker 4:  one with like a really neat stand looks. They made a, a phone, the

1119
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,480
Speaker 4:  ThinkPad phone, which, well, none of this matters. The only reason that we're

1120
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,280
Speaker 4:  doing this show today, the yoga book,

1121
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,560
Speaker 3:  Eating

1122
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,640
Speaker 4:  Tablet, not the ING tablet. They're weird Kindle scribe that no one will

1123
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,480
Speaker 4:  like except for Alex. It's the yoga book nine I, which is a

1124
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,200
Speaker 4:  dual screen laptop that has a stand that lets you

1125
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,760
Speaker 4:  stand both screens up in portrait configuration.

1126
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,320
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. And then like a removable keyboard that comes with it.

1127
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,680
Speaker 4:  And then just, you gotta watch this video. Go watch the video. Monica's like

1128
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,760
Speaker 4:  over the moon about this thing. It looks so cool.

1129
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:38,040
Speaker 3:  It looks like they've done this before. iPads.

1130
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

1131
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:43,400
Speaker 3:  Like this. I like, I'm really excited cuz we've been seeing this

1132
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,080
Speaker 3:  exact like concept for years.

1133
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,800
Speaker 3:  For a while you couldn't go to a single meeting with AMD or

1134
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,480
Speaker 3:  Intel without them showing off a concept like this and being like, dual

1135
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,240
Speaker 3:  screens are coming. Microsoft was doing it too. Everybody would have these

1136
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,160
Speaker 3:  big meetings and they would show off this exact concept, but janky as

1137
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,280
Speaker 3:  hell. And this is like slightly less janky,

1138
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,800
Speaker 4:  Dual 13.3 inch ed touchscreens coming

1139
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:08,960
Speaker 4:  aboard

1140
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,520
Speaker 3:  Coming. It's, you can actually buy it.

1141
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,760
Speaker 4:  Extremely weird vertical stand. This thing is

1142
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,520
Speaker 4:  so like, I'm just like, watch this video, watch this video. A slight remove.

1143
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,600
Speaker 4:  You've all seen Monica, you've watched her review video, video. She's been

1144
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,280
Speaker 4:  on the show. She's so captivated though by this thing that she's like,

1145
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,840
Speaker 4:  check out this easy 10 finger swipe.

1146
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,920
Speaker 4:  It's like, I dunno about that.

1147
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:37,080
Speaker 4:  It's great. The thing looks amazing. This is like what? Why CS

1148
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,920
Speaker 4:  exists is this laptop. It's so, I can't wait to buy one. I'm

1149
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,920
Speaker 4:  100% gonna buy one and then realize that I have no need for this at all and

1150
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,200
Speaker 4:  not use it, but just look at the configurations.

1151
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,240
Speaker 3:  Are you gonna return it like, like do we need to just time how long it takes

1152
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,400
Speaker 3:  you to to return it?

1153
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:56,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean I'm gonna have it, I just,

1154
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,040
Speaker 4:  just like look at it. You can put the, you can open it and then have both

1155
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,720
Speaker 4:  screens in portrait. So you like turn it sideways

1156
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:04,200
Speaker 3:  So you can read like a magazine.

1157
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Or like one full screen slack and one full screen doc and the keyboard's

1158
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,440
Speaker 4:  in front. You can swipe the, you can. And when the bottom screen is the,

1159
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,720
Speaker 4:  the keyboard, you can swipe the keyboard down to have keyboard in the front.

1160
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,080
Speaker 4:  And then you get a variety of status indicators that Lenovo thinks are important,

1161
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,640
Speaker 4:  but which are not important. It's so good. It has

1162
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,360
Speaker 5:  Haptic. So it feels like you're typing when you're

1163
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,640
Speaker 4:  Typing. Yeah. There's no way that a laptop size touching keyboard is going

1164
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,960
Speaker 4:  feel good with its haptics.

1165
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:31,960
Speaker 4:  $2,100 13th of Jan Intel core. I said

1166
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:36,560
Speaker 4:  blah 16, 16 gigs of rando and it's come,

1167
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,480
Speaker 4:  it's gonna ship in June as a pen. This is the future. You whatever

1168
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,520
Speaker 4:  ein nonsense. You think you love it.

1169
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,400
Speaker 3:  I think the most exciting thing about it is that the case and the

1170
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,080
Speaker 3:  pin and the keyboard are included.

1171
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:49,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1172
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:51,680
Speaker 3:  That like, that was the part I was like, Doug,

1173
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,800
Speaker 4:  It's it's a steal. How can you afford not to buy a Lenovo

1174
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,360
Speaker 3:  Book? Yeah. Instead of 2,500, it's 2000 for everything. Beautiful.

1175
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,400
Speaker 4:  I can't even get the name right. I'm so excited about it. How could you not

1176
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,240
Speaker 4:  buy a Lenovo yoga book Night Eye in the market for a Bluetooth

1177
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,000
Speaker 4:  keyboard? Have you considered the Lenovo yoga book Night Eye, which comes

1178
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,880
Speaker 4:  with a full laptop with dual 13.3 inch os. I want it so badly.

1179
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,280
Speaker 4:  It's like when I'm like, I kind of miss not being Cs like

1180
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:19,320
Speaker 4:  the sensation of walking into a hotel suite that has been arranged

1181
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:23,280
Speaker 4:  to display hundreds of laptops and like weird breakout boxes for tv.

1182
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,920
Speaker 4:  Is it? No. Like I can smell that room. You

1183
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,160
Speaker 3:  Can smell that.

1184
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,680
Speaker 4:  The crackle of old coffee. Yeah.

1185
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:32,160
Speaker 3:  Yes. Mm. That one like coffee

1186
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,680
Speaker 3:  fruit salad in the corner kind of getting a little old. It's beautiful.

1187
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,560
Speaker 4:  No one ever. It's the fruit salad. I

1188
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,560
Speaker 5:  Just, I'm, I'm envisioning getting on a plane with this and, and pulling

1189
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,160
Speaker 5:  out my dual stack oles in front of me that that reach

1190
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,840
Speaker 5:  above my head. Yeah. And

1191
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,240
Speaker 4:  I'm not, no, first what you do is you wa you walk up and down the aisle of

1192
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,800
Speaker 4:  that plane finding the one dude with the Samsung Galaxy fold

1193
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,600
Speaker 4:  who's hot shit. Cuz that person is on every plane. Now. There's one dude

1194
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,520
Speaker 4:  with a stylist in a Galaxy fold who's like, hmm, ho, ho ho, right? And

1195
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,160
Speaker 4:  then you, then you pull out your yoga book just full

1196
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,720
Speaker 4:  vertical unfold. You throw your keyboard in his lap, you start typing with

1197
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,280
Speaker 4:  your foot while you hold that thing up like a scroll.

1198
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,960
Speaker 3:  Don't even sit down

1199
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:16,480
Speaker 4:  If I'm ever gonna get kicked off a plane. That's how I'm going out. I'm not

1200
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,360
Speaker 4:  doing any of this like comfort animal stuff I'm

1201
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:20,560
Speaker 4:  doing.

1202
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,080
Speaker 4:  I'm doing old time navigator. One foot in the air on a keyboard

1203
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,000
Speaker 4:  holding up a double stack ole display. All right.

1204
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,800
Speaker 4:  That's enough. Other, do you wanna talk about this

1205
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,360
Speaker 4:  Kindle scribe?

1206
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:38,080
Speaker 3:  I mean it's, it's better than the Kindle scribe because it can, it actually

1207
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,800
Speaker 3:  lets you do more note taking stuff. But it's also worse

1208
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:46,000
Speaker 3:  in that it doesn't have an app store. It has, it runs Android but it

1209
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,600
Speaker 3:  doesn't have an app store. You can't side load a lot of image types, a lot

1210
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,560
Speaker 3:  of book types. It's very, very hamstrung. It's very

1211
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,320
Speaker 3:  clearly meant less for people who wanna read and

1212
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:01,280
Speaker 3:  more for like people who used to buy the Sony ePaper tablets

1213
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,240
Speaker 3:  where it just lets you do markups of PDFs. That's who

1214
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,920
Speaker 3:  this is for. And so like, cool. Maybe it'll bring the price down on these

1215
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,200
Speaker 3:  notetaking devices. Lenovo's been playing around with E Ink for a really

1216
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,120
Speaker 3:  long time. I love that they're doing like an all e Ink device, but

1217
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:20,160
Speaker 3:  I probably won't buy one. I'd love to review one Lenovo

1218
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:20,600
Speaker 3:  call me.

1219
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:24,600
Speaker 4:  Are you gonna look at the Think Whip plus which has a color E screen on the

1220
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,560
Speaker 4:  back of a regular display and you can swivel it around.

1221
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,280
Speaker 3:  Yeah, well they've been doing that for a while, but now it's just color.

1222
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,280
Speaker 3:  This is the year for Color E Ink.

1223
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,640
Speaker 4:  No, but now you can spin it around. It's on a swivel screen

1224
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,120
Speaker 3:  Before. Yeah, they had one with a swivel. I'm pretty sure.

1225
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,960
Speaker 3:  Because they had the original ones, which was like the, the the like it was

1226
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,640
Speaker 3:  a dual screen and you opened it up and one side was E ink and the other was

1227
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,000
Speaker 3:  color. But then they, at one point they were like, okay, we're just gonna

1228
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,680
Speaker 3:  have a swivel and you can just decide which screen you want to use.

1229
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:55,400
Speaker 4:  If the next time I see you, you're not trying to operate the verge on an

1230
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,240
Speaker 4:  e color E Ink think pad. I'm be very disappointed.

1231
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,120
Speaker 3:  I got, I got some work to do. I'll call you guys later.

1232
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,800
Speaker 4:  Bye. I love the HPE Dragonfly Pro

1233
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,880
Speaker 4:  Chromebook because it is a Chromebook with our G Keys.

1234
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:12,000
Speaker 4:  I am 1000% buy one of these from my parents.

1235
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:14,160
Speaker 3:  I love Monica's gonna have game like the why.

1236
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:18,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. She, Monica refused to count this. It's like the difference between

1237
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,040
Speaker 4:  her excitement over the yoga book where she's like, you just gotta watch

1238
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,960
Speaker 4:  that video. She's, it's gleeful. She is gleeful to be looking at that laptop.

1239
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,160
Speaker 4:  It's so happy. It's infectious. And then she's like, why do these keys let

1240
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,360
Speaker 4:  up and no one can answer.

1241
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:36,000
Speaker 4:  She also pointed out that the HP's elite

1242
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,440
Speaker 4:  line is for professionals and the pro line is for

1243
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,440
Speaker 4:  consumers. We're just like through like words have no meaning for Hewlett

1244
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,160
Speaker 4:  Packard at this point. So HP Elites

1245
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,760
Speaker 3:  I love you can only be elite enterprise

1246
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,440
Speaker 4:  Professional products. HP Pro for consumers.

1247
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:55,000
Speaker 4:  Very good. Buy buying a computer with your own money. Yeah. Not

1248
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,160
Speaker 4:  elite. Not elite.

1249
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:57,200
Speaker 3:  Not

1250
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,600
Speaker 4:  Elite, but pro

1251
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:00,080
Speaker 3:  Thrill, pro move.

1252
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,320
Speaker 4:  I'm super into this. I'm, I brought my parents a Chrome famously

1253
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,440
Speaker 4:  brought my parents a Chromebook years ago. It was the Chromebook Pixel, the

1254
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,080
Speaker 4:  thousand dollars first Chromebook and it, it is now end of life. They got

1255
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,520
Speaker 4:  a message while I was home saying that it would receive no more software

1256
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,680
Speaker 4:  updates. Which is hilarious cuz it's just Chrome.

1257
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,650
Speaker 3:  So you gotta get the new one.

1258
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,770
Speaker 4:  It's years. So I gotta get the new one. They, I can't get 'em in Pixel book.

1259
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:23,570
Speaker 4:  That's a way step down from a Chromebook pixel

1260
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,970
Speaker 5:  And and now you can buy them to HP Dragonfly. Proletariat.

1261
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,810
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'll be like, you're a gamer now, mom.

1262
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:34,530
Speaker 4:  It's like, rainbow Keys going. It's gonna be great. Any other

1263
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,130
Speaker 4:  laptop we should talk about? Should we talk about the Razor edge?

1264
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:41,130
Speaker 3:  It's, it's cool. Like, I mean this is, Razor's

1265
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:45,010
Speaker 3:  been doing a lot of work over the years with making mobile phones and

1266
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:47,450
Speaker 3:  they've been doing a lot of work over the years with making

1267
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:51,650
Speaker 3:  controllers that you can plug into mobile phones. And then they said, what

1268
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:54,890
Speaker 3:  if it's all one thing and we work with Verizon to sell it. Yeah. And it's

1269
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:55,730
Speaker 3:  got 5g.

1270
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,130
Speaker 4:  Who doesn't like 5g? And

1271
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,610
Speaker 5:  That's exactly what I was missing from the steam deck was the ability to

1272
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,090
Speaker 5:  buy it on contract from Verizon.

1273
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:01,930
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1274
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:06,610
Speaker 4:  360 bucks wifi only is 3 99. Think about that.

1275
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,650
Speaker 3:  Just, I mean, what a deal. I I I'll go with the steam deck.

1276
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:13,210
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna stick with the steam deck for right now. Especially with Stadia

1277
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,290
Speaker 3:  dying in a couple of weeks.

1278
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,250
Speaker 4:  I just think it's very funny that the pricing here is like old school phone

1279
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:21,850
Speaker 4:  contract pricing. Yeah. So the wifi only model costs 3 99

1280
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:26,650
Speaker 4:  5G model without a contract 5 99. But

1281
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:30,450
Speaker 4:  if you sign the Verizon contract 3 59, like see

1282
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:34,730
Speaker 4:  the math is like, this is how much Verizon is soaking you for. It's $200.

1283
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,170
Speaker 3:  So good.

1284
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,650
Speaker 4:  It's pretty good. I don't know. It kinda looks like a Nexus seven.

1285
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,890
Speaker 4:  It's, every time I look at it, I'm like, it's an XUS seven.

1286
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,290
Speaker 3:  It's a fab, like the FTE is back and razor razor

1287
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,970
Speaker 3:  resurrected the fab and said, what if it, you stuck it in

1288
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:53,930
Speaker 3:  between two sides of controllers and it's had something for all of your

1289
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:57,570
Speaker 3:  cloud gaming. So if you don't already have a steam deck and you don't already

1290
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:01,530
Speaker 3:  have one of the other mini like mobile PC handhelds right now,

1291
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,850
Speaker 3:  this is, this is a cool, this is an interesting option.

1292
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,090
Speaker 4:  I think the big test here is really Verizons network can actually do cloud

1293
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:12,010
Speaker 4:  gaming like this and we'll see. All right, we gotta take a

1294
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:15,490
Speaker 4:  break. We'll come back. We got a little bit of a CS lightning round. It's

1295
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:19,450
Speaker 4:  not over yet. You're still in Vegas with us. We'll be right back.

1296
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,030

1312
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:26,760
Speaker 3:  Go. Let's

1313
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:30,080
Speaker 4:  Go. All right. Delta and T-Mobile making in-flight. Wifi free. If you have

1314
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,840
Speaker 4:  sky miles sounds great. Also, if you just knew anybody with a

1315
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,600
Speaker 4:  T-Mobile phone number, you could have typed in that number for years, which

1316
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,320
Speaker 4:  is, I now feel comfortable disclosing.

1317
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,200
Speaker 5:  But it was weird before, it was like some flights, it was like that and in

1318
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,640
Speaker 5:  some flights it would not have that. So now it's just gonna be all flights

1319
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,960
Speaker 5:  free, whatever if

1320
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,920
Speaker 4:  You, but there's this thing called Delta Sync. They're not giving

1321
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,760
Speaker 4:  you this thing for free. They are gonna target ads at you on this network.

1322
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,520
Speaker 4:  Somehow. They've, they're talking about

1323
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:02,230
Speaker 4:  personalization, which is a code for targeted ads. And as

1324
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:06,150
Speaker 4:  we know, like ISPs, mobile caries in particular,

1325
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:10,270
Speaker 4:  love to do weird ad targeting stuff. Love to collect data in weird ways.

1326
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,430
Speaker 4:  I just wanna read these terms of service before this thing goes live. That's

1327
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:14,390
Speaker 4:  all I'm saying. Do

1328
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:15,470
Speaker 3:  They say how fast it'll

1329
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:18,310
Speaker 4:  Be? It's supposed to be fast enough for streaming cuz it's ViaSat. It's not

1330
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,430
Speaker 4:  the old Go-Go stuff.

1331
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,450
Speaker 3:  Okay.

1332
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,170
Speaker 4:  So we'll see. Delta's also doing a test with starlink. I think a bunch of

1333
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:27,030
Speaker 4:  airlines are testing starlink on the side, but I, I'm just, I'm

1334
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:30,630
Speaker 4:  flagging this one cuz free in-flight wifi is great. Cool, whatever.

1335
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:34,950
Speaker 4:  When you add the, when you just like throw the word personalization in the

1336
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:36,950
Speaker 4:  mix, I'm like, oh, they're gonna do some weird ad targeting.

1337
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:40,630
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Think about what you're, what you're using that wifi for. Don't, don't,

1338
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:44,230
Speaker 3:  don't, don't go to certain places with this wifi also because kids are around.

1339
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:44,590
Speaker 3:  But like,

1340
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:46,470
Speaker 4:  Also because you're on a plane, Alex,

1341
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:51,590
Speaker 3:  I've seen it happen. I've seen it happen. I've watched people

1342
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:54,390
Speaker 3:  just like load up on their phone and I'm like, okay,

1343
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,750
Speaker 4:  We were flying home from Chicago and Becky was like, oh, don't worry Darling

1344
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,310
Speaker 4:  is on the plane. I might watch that. I'm like, no, you should not watch that

1345
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,350
Speaker 4:  on this plane right now.

1346
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:04,550
Speaker 3:  Not the planes.

1347
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,030
Speaker 4:  There's a new version of chi, the wireless charging protocol

1348
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:11,630
Speaker 4:  chi. It's called

1349
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:14,750
Speaker 3:  Chichi. Our reviews editor, Nathan Edwards is so excited about

1350
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:17,630
Speaker 4:  This. Sean Holster ridiculous. Excited about this. Basically what's happened

1351
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:21,430
Speaker 4:  here, unsurprisingly, there was chi, the wireless standing, the

1352
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:25,510
Speaker 4:  wireless charging protocol. Apple took it, forked

1353
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:26,670
Speaker 4:  it into MagSafe,

1354
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,310
Speaker 3:  Put some magnets on it,

1355
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:32,470
Speaker 4:  Put some magnets on it, redid the coils, did some authentication

1356
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:36,350
Speaker 4:  stuff to charge at a faster rate, but still back compatible chi. And now

1357
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:39,790
Speaker 4:  Apple says we're gonna give the magnet stuff to chi. That's gonna form the

1358
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:43,270
Speaker 4:  basis of chi two. It'll allow for non-fat

1359
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:46,830
Speaker 4:  connectors. I e a watch. Very exciting all the way around.

1360
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:50,150
Speaker 4:  The magnets still will not be strong enough to hold up a phone, which is

1361
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:53,950
Speaker 4:  a huge miss. Just a huge miss For those of you

1362
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:56,950
Speaker 4:  like me who are addicted to buying car chargers for your phone and

1363
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,190
Speaker 4:  unclear whether Chetu will be back compatible with MagSafe as it

1364
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:05,990
Speaker 4:  currently exists. So some bits and bobs here,

1365
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:10,110
Speaker 4:  but it looks like Apple decided that MagSafe, which is like

1366
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:14,280
Speaker 4:  more or less not a success. It's, it's a success in

1367
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,080
Speaker 4:  that it exists in the Apple ecosystem

1368
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,800
Speaker 3:  And nobody adopted it.

1369
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:22,040
Speaker 4:  And people like you can buy accessories for it, but the magnets are too weak

1370
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:26,000
Speaker 4:  to do anything particularly interesting. It's just a, it's weird.

1371
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,840
Speaker 4:  Like my favorite MagSafe accessory is a little puck that I bought

1372
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,800
Speaker 4:  to mount by my bathroom mirror so I can watch TV

1373
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,200
Speaker 4:  in the morning while brushing my teeth.

1374
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:36,200
Speaker 3:  Does it work?

1375
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:40,320
Speaker 4:  It's awesome. It rules. I highly recommend you spend $15

1376
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,680
Speaker 4:  on a MagSafe puck to mount next to your bathroom mirror so you can open YouTube

1377
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,600
Speaker 4:  in the morning. You're YouTube tv in my case. It's great. Just do it

1378
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,280
Speaker 4:  like Richard

1379
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,880
Speaker 3:  Doesn't look excited. I'm

1380
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,680
Speaker 5:  Confused. I I guess I'll find it use now because now on Android

1381
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,760
Speaker 5:  we'll we'll have, we'll find out. It's like, it's one of those things where,

1382
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:59,880
Speaker 5:  because it's only been on on iPhone, like I've heard about it, I'm like,

1383
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,560
Speaker 5:  oh that sounds cool, but I've never actually used it to find out what it

1384
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,640
Speaker 5:  doesn't do and like where the shortcomings are.

1385
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:08,600
Speaker 4:  It just doesn't do a lot. It's a wireless charging thing with weak magnets.

1386
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:12,680
Speaker 4:  But what is true is that every iPhone now has magnets

1387
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,240
Speaker 4:  built into the back of it. So other companies can make

1388
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,160
Speaker 4:  stronger magnets for things like mounts and cases, which are neat.

1389
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:24,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But the but the combination of I want strong magnets,

1390
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:28,280
Speaker 4:  15 wat wireless charging in something that doesn't look totally ugly

1391
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:32,320
Speaker 4:  has alluded every and you need to be certified by Apple that you

1392
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,320
Speaker 4:  can't, you can't.

1393
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,040
Speaker 3:  Nobody's under. Nobody's cracked that

1394
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,960
Speaker 4:  One. Nobody's pulled it off. So we're getting there. We'll I think the big

1395
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,680
Speaker 4:  question here is whether Q2 with magnets will be back

1396
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,240
Speaker 4:  compatible with MagSafe. Cuz I think the answer might be no.

1397
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,160
Speaker 3:  Hmm.

1398
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:50,400
Speaker 4:  There's some shadiness there. Bunch of smart home stuff. It's a big year

1399
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:50,800
Speaker 4:  for matter.

1400
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:53,240
Speaker 3:  It's the year for matter. It's

1401
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,200
Speaker 4:  The year for matter. It's, I would say matter has not gotten off to

1402
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:01,000
Speaker 4:  a raging start. Apple had to pull it, right? Remember they did the update

1403
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,480
Speaker 4:  for iOS, it's in Go well and they pulled it.

1404
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,440
Speaker 4:  But there's new bridges. There's New Eve.

1405
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:11,520
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean gin. So Jen's at the show, we're gonna talk to her a bunch

1406
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,360
Speaker 3:  next week about this next Wednesday. But she says she's just

1407
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,320
Speaker 3:  seeing Matter everywhere. She's seeing everybody's like, Hey, I have a new

1408
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,960
Speaker 3:  refrigerator with Matter in it, a new TV

1409
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:26,320
Speaker 3:  with Matter. Like everybody that's, that's how they announce it.

1410
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,320
Speaker 3:  They announce all this stuff and they're like, and Matter. So she's seeing

1411
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:33,200
Speaker 3:  just everywhere on the show floor right now. So the thing I'm really

1412
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,040
Speaker 3:  about excited about is there's this new Phillips Hue app

1413
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,440
Speaker 3:  that you can get on Samsung TVs

1414
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:44,640
Speaker 3:  and it will let you sync all of the lights on the back of your tv.

1415
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,800
Speaker 3:  If you put Phillips Hue lights on the back of your tv, it'll let you sync

1416
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:51,080
Speaker 3:  it with all the content without having to go through a breakout box. But

1417
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,360
Speaker 3:  because they still want money, you have to pay $130

1418
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,240
Speaker 3:  for the app.

1419
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,000
Speaker 4:  That's pretty good.

1420
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,880
Speaker 3:  You don't know if you can take that app with you when you, if your TV dies

1421
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,320
Speaker 3:  and you get a new tv, well you have to pay another $130. There's a bunch

1422
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:09,120
Speaker 3:  of questions about this also. Like why not just

1423
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,880
Speaker 3:  make Samsung pay for the, the technology

1424
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:16,560
Speaker 3:  and be like, hey look, if you plug your Phillips HU lights into the new

1425
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,160
Speaker 3:  Samsung TVs, you can automatically sync. Yeah

1426
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,720
Speaker 3:  there's just like a bunch of kitchen

1427
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:25,520
Speaker 4:  Or you can go by any number of gov kits on Amazon for like 50

1428
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,520
Speaker 4:  bucks and accomplish this song.

1429
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,440
Speaker 3:  The gov tip kits, you have to have like a camera pointed at your tv. This,

1430
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,520
Speaker 3:  you don't have to have anything pointed at it. You don't have to worry about

1431
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,840
Speaker 3:  like, oh I really need this to go through H D M I

1432
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,760
Speaker 3:  2.1 so that I can get the, and the box only does H D M

1433
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,080
Speaker 3:  I 2.0. You don't have to worry about any of that. You can just be like go.

1434
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:47,360
Speaker 3:  It works for all the different apps on your TV and everything. So any like

1435
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,600
Speaker 3:  input to your tv, it does it.

1436
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah, but it's

1437
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,400
Speaker 3:  $130 app,

1438
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,400
Speaker 4:  Right? That's where you lose me. I I for your tv. I understand the points

1439
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,040
Speaker 4:  you're making. I'm like the gov kit's like 50 bucks. You point of camera

1440
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,200
Speaker 4:  at your TV call today.

1441
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:58,920
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1442
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:01,240
Speaker 4:  No more computers required.

1443
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:03,360
Speaker 3:  It's very exciting and very stupid.

1444
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,280
Speaker 4:  I love it. Jen also covered the weird wooden plank matter

1445
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,600
Speaker 4:  controller. This is the thing I'm most excited about with matter at, at the

1446
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,240
Speaker 4:  end of the day is now you can make different kinds of smart home controllers

1447
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,170
Speaker 4:  cuz they can talk to everything. She was like, here's a cutting board you

1448
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:20,970
Speaker 4:  can mount on the wall to turn your lights on and off. And I was like, yeah,

1449
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,630
Speaker 4:  I'm in it. Like this is what we need. It's gonna be great. Exactly

1450
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,150
Speaker 3:  What we need.

1451
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:29,990
Speaker 4:  And lastly, we should talk about this Withings P sensor. You just stick it

1452
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:32,750
Speaker 4:  in your toilet and pee on it and it tells you what your metabolism is doing.

1453
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:36,390
Speaker 3:  It's, it's, it's great. People really care about the P sensor.

1454
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,930
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I will say that the p sensor did remarkable traffic. Here's

1455
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:44,610
Speaker 4:  a line from the story written by Victoria. It sounds

1456
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:47,010
Speaker 4:  relatively simple, but with things is very serious about p

1457
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,690
Speaker 4:  it took four years and 13 patents. But you don't have to do anything until

1458
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:56,850
Speaker 4:  it's time to recharge the reader or switch out cartridges. The reader, the

1459
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:59,600
Speaker 4:  P reader that you put in your toilet. U S P C my friends.

1460
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,400
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah, that's the, that we had a, we had a really long conversation about

1461
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,680
Speaker 3:  this in the editing process because I just had all the questions. I was like,

1462
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,640
Speaker 3:  well, like do you have to touch it all the time? Like are you having to like

1463
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,440
Speaker 3:  reach down there and touch the pock before to, to test it

1464
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:17,440
Speaker 3:  and no you don't. You stick it in there. There's some cartridges, it comes

1465
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,760
Speaker 3:  with some gloves. So if you wanna hold on those glove,

1466
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,760
Speaker 4:  Do you have to saves the gloves between don't cartridge

1467
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,560
Speaker 3:  Changes? I don't think. That's just like a polite thing. And the idea

1468
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,400
Speaker 3:  is anytime you pee on it, it'll detect it and

1469
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,200
Speaker 3:  do a test. So sometimes you may have to like do

1470
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,640
Speaker 3:  some, some shifting to make sure you're not peeing on it if you don't want

1471
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,400
Speaker 3:  test. Cuz it has like a hundred cartridges. All right.

1472
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,000
Speaker 3:  It's like a hundred days of P tests. Well,

1473
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,720
Speaker 5:  We're not gonna talk about the number one smart home story that at least

1474
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,320
Speaker 5:  surprise me. The shower pods,

1475
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:50,320
Speaker 4:  The colder. Wait, before we go on the shower pods, can I just read you this

1476
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,160
Speaker 4:  quote about data collection in the GDPR compliance of the

1477
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:58,080
Speaker 4:  P sensor? Yes. And this is a quote, it's our company guideline

1478
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,640
Speaker 4:  not to allow anyone to look at that data. We still need to look at the

1479
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,320
Speaker 4:  details regarding law enforcement. Just

1480
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,200
Speaker 4:  don't let the cops look at my t dude,

1481
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,080
Speaker 3:  Don't show them my urine, please.

1482
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:12,800
Speaker 4:  Very good. All right. Richard, what was your number one?

1483
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,480
Speaker 5:  The nu number one surprise people could not get enough of this story. The

1484
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,720
Speaker 5:  shower pods are here to turn your bathrooms in into a pod. They've got aromatherapy,

1485
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:22,680
Speaker 5:  shower infusion system. Apparently more, more than MagSafe. When, when you're

1486
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,280
Speaker 5:  brushing your teeth, this is what the people need. I, I don't know. I didn't

1487
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,480
Speaker 5:  quite get it, but the girls will get it. Get it. This is

1488
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,320
Speaker 3:  For all the people who can still smell things.

1489
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:33,400
Speaker 4:  Yes. Kohler loves doing gadgets at cs. Like love, loves,

1490
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,360
Speaker 4:  loves it. I think last year they did like a $10,000 toilet

1491
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,320
Speaker 3:  For a plumbing company. They got big tech ambitions.

1492
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:43,040
Speaker 4:  They do. I mean this is just a, they're pods, you know, it's like a

1493
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,680
Speaker 4:  Kerik. Yeah. Aromatherapy pods and like a shower that takes P pods.

1494
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,720
Speaker 4:  There's not a lot

1495
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,600
Speaker 5:  Of, there's probably a subscription package for your, for your shower. Like

1496
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,440
Speaker 5:  I, I I see the, I see the meth now.

1497
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. They, they're gonna sell you more pods. Here's a quote from their

1498
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,520
Speaker 4:  press release. Kohler says the pods are safe to use on your entire body,

1499
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,120
Speaker 4:  which it's a shower.

1500
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,760
Speaker 5:  Has a lot of people asking questions that should be answered by my teacher.

1501
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,000
Speaker 5:  You

1502
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,480
Speaker 3:  Can watch, watch every bit. Yeah.

1503
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,280
Speaker 4:  Like if, if there was something that I assumed from the jump it

1504
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,920
Speaker 4:  was, is the shower safe for my entire body?

1505
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,280
Speaker 4:  Very good. Who's

1506
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,680
Speaker 3:  Making the pods that aren't safe for your entire body is what I want to know.

1507
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,680
Speaker 4:  That's what, yeah. Right. The illegal pods.

1508
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:27,040
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Don't buy those illegal pods. People

1509
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,840
Speaker 5:  Get into the discord with somebody just making bootle pods on their own.

1510
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:34,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah, these pods burn me. Here's your business model, Richard.

1511
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:38,840
Speaker 4:  The design of the Sprigg shower pods are Kohler specific. We'll see if

1512
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,960
Speaker 4:  there's actual software D rm. But right now, right, the pods are shaped.

1513
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,640
Speaker 4:  They have to fit in a thing. $21 for a six pack of single

1514
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:49,560
Speaker 4:  use pods. Wow. $24 for a

1515
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,130
Speaker 4:  single multi-use pod with eight uses, a

1516
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:56,450
Speaker 4:  multi-use pod with eight uses. Gonna do the math there.

1517
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:59,730
Speaker 3:  How many, how many what? What constitutes a use?

1518
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:03,850
Speaker 4:  All I'm saying is they're gonna charge you about $3 per shower no matter

1519
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:06,970
Speaker 4:  which way you're going. $21 for six single use pods,

1520
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:10,530
Speaker 4:  $24 for multi-use pod that can be used eight times. Do

1521
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:12,970
Speaker 3:  You think the showerhead stops working if you don't have a pod in there,

1522
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,930
Speaker 3:  like you just aren't allowed to be clean.

1523
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,850
Speaker 4:  That's when it starts burning you, Alex?

1524
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,370
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1525
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,970
Speaker 5:  Or if there's a software update, because some, because someone's hacked the

1526
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:25,090
Speaker 4:  Pod system. It's like warning, this is no longer safe for your entire body,

1527
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:28,370
Speaker 4:  but we're not telling you where it's the problem. Enjoy the caller corporation.

1528
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,970
Speaker 4:  It's true that this is one of our top stories from this entire Cs, and I

1529
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:35,810
Speaker 4:  appreciate all of you for reading about the shower pods. One of my

1530
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:39,370
Speaker 4:  favorite headlines of all time was a Paul Miller. Ashley Carmen joint.

1531
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,530
Speaker 4:  I think Paul had the vibe line, but I think Ashley actually came up with

1532
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:46,410
Speaker 4:  the headline. It was just the word tortilla pods in all capital letters.

1533
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:52,690
Speaker 4:  And it was the whole story, like no further explanation.

1534
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:57,210
Speaker 4:  And it was like a startup selling a pod system to make

1535
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:57,890
Speaker 4:  tortillas.

1536
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,490
Speaker 3:  It's a very good headline.

1537
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:03,130
Speaker 4:  And all of the comments were like, you can just make tortillas.

1538
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:08,160
Speaker 4:  This is a deeply solved problem. Very good. Well, pods

1539
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,520
Speaker 4:  are back. Everyone. CS is rocking. And Roland, there's tons of news

1540
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:16,120
Speaker 4:  on the site. I'm like I said, I'm feeling I got, I have the

1541
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:20,040
Speaker 4:  fomo. There's a part of me that's for my own health. I'm happy I'm not

1542
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:23,880
Speaker 4:  there. It's, it's bad to be there. It's bad to be in lo it's bad for

1543
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,760
Speaker 4:  you. But I'm, I miss, I miss our team. I miss Skats. I miss

1544
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,400
Speaker 4:  hotel rooms and the coffee smell.

1545
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:33,080
Speaker 3:  I, I still got the c e s funk despite not

1546
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,640
Speaker 4:  Being there. I miss walking outta Lenovo briefing, believing in my heart

1547
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,280
Speaker 4:  that eight and 10 finger gestures on a dual screen, 13.3 inch

1548
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:44,240
Speaker 4:  od laptop is like the future of all computing. Like I,

1549
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:48,320
Speaker 4:  I feel that, but don't worry, there's more CS to

1558
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,520
Speaker 4:  Verge articles, which I think is terrifying. Our reporters. Cause I like

1559
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,480
Speaker 4:  getting into fights in the comments articles.

1560
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:16,960
