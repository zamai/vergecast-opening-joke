Description: Fresh off a day filled with new Apple products, The Verge’s ground team reports back on everything they’ve seen — and touched. Allison Johnson walks us through the new iPhone Air, iPhone 17, and iPhone 17 Pro lineups, making sense of all the new camera features and wondering just how thin a phone really can be. After that, Victoria Song talks about why the AirPods Pro 3 may have been the big hit of the day, plus all the details on the three new models of Apple Watch. Finally, Jake Kastrenakes tells us about his first experience live at an Apple event, explains the appeal of a crossbody strap, and has a theory about why an orange phone is such a big deal.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,805
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Cross Body Straps. I'm

3
00:00:03,805 --> 00:00:07,405
Speaker 1:  your friend David Pierce, and I'm back. I've been gone all summer. I have

4
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:10,885
Speaker 1:  a two month old baby who you will almost certainly hear at some point during

5
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,725
Speaker 1:  this episode. He's just right upstairs right now, and he has a lot of thoughts

6
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:17,285
Speaker 1:  about a lot of technology. I'm so, so happy to be back with all of you.

7
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:21,285
Speaker 1:  Thank you to Jen and v and Allison and Mia

8
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:24,885
Speaker 1:  and Jake and everybody who was on the show all summer, hanging out with you

9
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:28,045
Speaker 1:  guys and talking about tech. I had a lot of fun listening to the show. I

10
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:31,605
Speaker 1:  hope you did too. But I'm very glad to be back yelling all of my feelings

11
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:34,565
Speaker 1:  into a microphone because this is what I do and this is what I'm here for.

12
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:38,685
Speaker 1:  And today I have a lot of stuff to tell you about my summer and all of the

13
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:41,725
Speaker 1:  stuff that's been going on, but we're gonna get to that later. Today we're

14
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:45,045
Speaker 1:  talking about Apple as I'm recording this Apple's keynote just finished.

15
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:48,925
Speaker 1:  We got the new AirPods, we got some new watches, we got some new iPhones.

16
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:52,805
Speaker 1:  We got an iPhone air that I think is like kind of the secret to

17
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:56,245
Speaker 1:  the whole future of Apple as a company. We have a lot to talk about and we're

18
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:59,445
Speaker 1:  gonna talk about it with the folks who were actually on the ground. They

19
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:02,805
Speaker 1:  have some meetings to do. They have some hands ons to get. We're gonna let

20
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:05,525
Speaker 1:  them finish all of their stuff and then they're going to come on the show

21
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:09,685
Speaker 1:  and tell us about all of it. It's gonna be awesome. It's all coming up in

22
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,965
Speaker 1:  just a sec. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

23
00:01:56,905 --> 00:02:00,805
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Allison Johnson is here in a hotel room somewhere

24
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:04,805
Speaker 1:  deep in Silicon Valley, I assume at this point. Yes. How you

25
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:05,205
Speaker 1:  holding up?

26
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:09,165
Speaker 3:  Great. I am coasting on fumes and little

27
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:13,405
Speaker 3:  appetizers that I ate for lunch, but that's, that's iPhone day baby.

28
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,405
Speaker 1:  Yeah, this is, this is what we do here. Yeah. You, you eat a bo you have

29
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:20,405
Speaker 1:  a bunch of coffee first thing in the morning, and then you don't eat anything

30
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:23,925
Speaker 1:  else for 11 hours. And that's, that's typically what the day is like. It's

31
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:24,005
Speaker 1:  good

32
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:27,805
Speaker 3:  To, and then I'm like, why do I have a headache? Yeah. You know why.

33
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:28,085
Speaker 3:  So

34
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:31,205
Speaker 1:  It's, it's a fun day and then you get to the end and you remember nothing

35
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,565
Speaker 1:  about any of it. And we all just move on with our lives.

36
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:34,765
Speaker 3:  It's true. So

37
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:38,565
Speaker 1:  This is why we do this podcast. This is to put in into the record that this

38
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:41,605
Speaker 1:  day actually happened for you. Yeah. And then you never have to think about

39
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:42,085
Speaker 1:  it ever again.

40
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:43,325
Speaker 3:  I appreciate that.

41
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,325
Speaker 1:  So obviously it was iPhone day,

42
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:52,005
Speaker 1:  I would say one of the less anticipated

43
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:56,045
Speaker 1:  iPhone days in a minute. It's possible. This is just 'cause I have been on

44
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:58,845
Speaker 1:  parental leave and not like paying attention to tech news for a while, but

45
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,165
Speaker 1:  I've been like loosely paying attention. And I feel like the summer there's

46
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:05,445
Speaker 1:  usually a, a big rumor mill and a lot of people thinking like big heady thoughts

47
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:07,885
Speaker 1:  about what does The iPhone mean and is this the end of The iPhone and what's

48
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:11,685
Speaker 1:  coming next? This didn't really feel like a super anticipated

49
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:15,005
Speaker 1:  iPhone season to me. Mm. Yeah. Did it feel like one to you?

50
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:20,165
Speaker 3:  I think there was, it's kind of shifted in a way to where we're,

51
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,525
Speaker 3:  our ears are kind of perking up for WWDC and the

52
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:28,885
Speaker 3:  sort of Apple intelligence and series stuff. 'cause that's just sort of a,

53
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:33,005
Speaker 3:  a story right now. I feel like the rumors kind of picked up

54
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:36,845
Speaker 3:  a little bit closer to the event. There were some

55
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:40,565
Speaker 3:  wild things flying around about like variable

56
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:43,405
Speaker 3:  zoom lenses and apertures that changed.

57
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:48,245
Speaker 3:  That stuff didn't happen. But it seems like we got

58
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:50,445
Speaker 3:  the, the kind of like

59
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:55,885
Speaker 3:  cosmetic stuff we were expecting. So if, if your

60
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:59,565
Speaker 3:  idea of a good time isn't, like The iPhone camera

61
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:03,525
Speaker 3:  bump goes sideways, then you probably weren't too

62
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:04,645
Speaker 3:  hyped for this one.

63
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:09,685
Speaker 1:  Fair. Yeah. Yeah. I think we, this was just, I guess this sort of year

64
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:13,525
Speaker 1:  where no one expected like real true fireworks, right? Like we,

65
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:17,245
Speaker 1:  we've been hearing a lot that there is kind of a three year plan

66
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:20,165
Speaker 1:  about foldable phones and flip phones and

67
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,285
Speaker 1:  this just seemed like maybe it was gonna be the, the, the year

68
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:28,165
Speaker 1:  before the year. And I think in, in a bunch of ways it was and is actually,

69
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:32,165
Speaker 1:  this is a, a good segue into the first phone I wanna talk about, which is,

70
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:35,165
Speaker 1:  it feels like we have to start with The iPhone Air, right? Which was, yeah,

71
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:39,085
Speaker 1:  it, it won't be the most successful phone that Apple launched today, but

72
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:43,005
Speaker 1:  it will certainly be the one most people talk about for the next week or

73
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:46,805
Speaker 1:  so, at the very least. So The iPhone Air, just to, just to run down the

74
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:50,645
Speaker 1:  specs very quickly, it is quite thin. I, I don't

75
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:54,445
Speaker 1:  know exactly how thin 5.6 millimeters is supposed to be,

76
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,885
Speaker 1:  but it's quite thin. They said the thinnest iPhone ever. It's, it's a thousand

77
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:02,285
Speaker 1:  dollars. It has 256 gigs of storage. They said it's very

78
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,165
Speaker 1:  durable. It has a bunch of new technology inside it.

79
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:10,685
Speaker 1:  Surprisingly good battery life, surprisingly, like solid

80
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:14,725
Speaker 1:  specs next to the rest of the, the, The iPhone

81
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:16,605
Speaker 1:  lineup. But the thing is, it's thin.

82
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:21,925
Speaker 1:  I I have, I have a cynical take about this And I have an optimistic take

83
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:24,525
Speaker 1:  about this, but mostly what I just wanna know is like, how does it feel to

84
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,525
Speaker 1:  hold this thing in your hand?

85
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,725
Speaker 3:  It's gonna be very irritating, but it feels re

86
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:34,085
Speaker 3:  you kind of have to pick it up to understand it. It does feel

87
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:37,965
Speaker 3:  really light. It is really thin. Like, you know, this going

88
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:42,045
Speaker 3:  in, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S 25 Edge had

89
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:46,005
Speaker 3:  the same experience of like, who cares? A thin phone. Like sure,

90
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:50,165
Speaker 3:  people want battery life. What's the big deal? And then you hold it and you

91
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:53,885
Speaker 3:  use it and you're like, oh, this, this really is kind of different.

92
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:58,105
Speaker 3:  Same experience picking up the, The iPhone Air.

93
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:02,505
Speaker 3:  It feels like, it's just, it's strange. We're so

94
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:05,825
Speaker 3:  attuned to how, like, how heavy a phone should be.

95
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:10,105
Speaker 3:  So you, you read the difference on a piece of paper and you're like, that's

96
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:13,865
Speaker 3:  not the, the weight especially, you're like, that's not much that much

97
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:17,225
Speaker 3:  lighter. You pick it up, you're like, oh my God, I feel like I'm gonna break

98
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:18,185
Speaker 3:  this thing. It's so tiny

99
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:21,185
Speaker 1:  In terms of what it feels like to pick it up, right? I think there's like,

100
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:25,425
Speaker 1:  there's like, whoa, this thing is thin and there's right next to

101
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:28,905
Speaker 1:  that feeling there is like, oh my God, am I gonna break this? And I think

102
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,585
Speaker 1:  that was one of the feelings I saw from a lot of people was like, is this

103
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:36,385
Speaker 1:  thing going to snap in my back pocket because it's so

104
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:40,265
Speaker 1:  thin? Is this thing going to just like fall apart if I

105
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:44,105
Speaker 1:  look at it wrong because it's so thin. And I was thinking a lot about the

106
00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:48,025
Speaker 1:  M four iPad Pro that launched like last year in, in

107
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:51,905
Speaker 1:  2024, which is the closest thing I've had to, it

108
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:55,025
Speaker 1:  sounds like the experience you had today, which is I, I picked up the thing

109
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:58,185
Speaker 1:  and it was, it's this incredibly like impossibly thin iPad

110
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,745
Speaker 1:  and you know, we're we're reporters at a press event. I'm like trying to

111
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:03,985
Speaker 1:  play it cool. It's like, don't, don't be weird, don't clap in the event.

112
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:08,025
Speaker 1:  Like I picked it up in front of an Apple PR person and completely involuntarily

113
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:11,785
Speaker 1:  just went holy shit. Yeah. And I had this moment of being like, this thing

114
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:15,745
Speaker 1:  isn't supposed to feel like this. Yeah. And I don't know that it meaningfully

115
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:18,465
Speaker 1:  changed my experience of using it for the next year,

116
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:23,385
Speaker 1:  but I liked it more because of that and that counts for something.

117
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,025
Speaker 1:  And so it's like, is that the kind of experience you're talking about here

118
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:29,185
Speaker 1:  where it's like this isn't, I don't know,

119
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,705
Speaker 1:  maybe it is some incredible engineering marvel where you're like, I can't

120
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:36,465
Speaker 1:  even believe this is a smartphone anymore. Or maybe it's just like,

121
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:39,385
Speaker 1:  it feels cool and that counts for something.

122
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:43,745
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I think it's a little bit of both. It's like, maybe this exists

123
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:47,305
Speaker 3:  because Apple and Samsung are just like, well, we

124
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:50,745
Speaker 3:  ran out of things to do, so we're gonna make it thin. Now

125
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:56,025
Speaker 3:  maybe it exists because they're like, we need to sell more

126
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:59,865
Speaker 3:  phones. How about something that looks different and feels different?

127
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:05,465
Speaker 3:  I, for me it was little moments like using the

128
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:09,505
Speaker 3:  Galaxy Edge, especially where, especially

129
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:13,385
Speaker 3:  with a phone, you, you are taking it everywhere you go. I,

130
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:17,065
Speaker 3:  they have so many different pants. I put it in the pockets of and bags

131
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:21,225
Speaker 3:  and every time it kind of fits into a, a

132
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:25,185
Speaker 3:  bag that I'm used to shoving a bulky phone into, I was

133
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:29,105
Speaker 3:  like, oh, this is nice. It feel just like, just a little moment of,

134
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:32,225
Speaker 3:  oh, okay. You know? Yeah. I see the point of this.

135
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,225
Speaker 1:  Do you think it'll use differently? Like I, I I I, I think you're probably

136
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:40,145
Speaker 1:  right that it'll carry differently because it's thinner and lighter and

137
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,545
Speaker 1:  and smaller that way. But like, and you've only used it a little bit so

138
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,345
Speaker 1:  you can reserve judgment on this for now, but is your sense that like it'll,

139
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:50,985
Speaker 1:  it'll actually feel different to manipulate the thing because it's thinner

140
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:51,305
Speaker 1:  this way?

141
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:54,905
Speaker 3:  The thing I kind of wonder, especially

142
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:59,325
Speaker 3:  since like the pro iPhones have gotten so big

143
00:08:59,465 --> 00:08:59,925
Speaker 3:  and heavy

144
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:05,365
Speaker 3:  and the thing that, that I get tired of is sitting

145
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:07,085
Speaker 3:  and reading kind of one handed

146
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:12,805
Speaker 3:  that might feel better over a length of time. You know, like

147
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:16,725
Speaker 3:  it's the kind of thing you, you notice if you're living with

148
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,565
Speaker 3:  a device and hard to say when you pick it up for, you know,

149
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:23,885
Speaker 3:  five minutes and there's 30 people behind you Right.

150
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:26,445
Speaker 3:  Wanting you to move out of the way.

151
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:29,845
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's, it,

152
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:33,005
Speaker 1:  It's gonna save us from our pinky divots is what you're, is what you're saying,

153
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:35,685
Speaker 1:  like the thing where we all hold the phones like this? No, and you get the,

154
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:36,445
Speaker 1:  you get the hole in your

155
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:39,005
Speaker 3:  Like nothing can save us from the pinky divots.

156
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:44,085
Speaker 3:  It's here to stay. Yeah. No, but yeah, it could, it could

157
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,205
Speaker 3:  be meaningfully more comfortable to use,

158
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:53,445
Speaker 3:  but I think it, it might end up being a lot of, like, it

159
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:57,165
Speaker 3:  is just a little bit less of a pain in the butt to put into a bag and carry

160
00:09:57,165 --> 00:09:59,325
Speaker 3:  around and, and looks kind of cool.

161
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:03,605
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I, I will say I really do buy the theory that

162
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:07,615
Speaker 1:  it looks kind of cool means something, right? Like especially these things

163
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:11,455
Speaker 1:  are so like a commoditized in our life,

164
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:15,415
Speaker 1:  but also b like ever present things in our lives. And

165
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:19,455
Speaker 1:  I think making it nicer to look at and hold

166
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,455
Speaker 1:  for its own sake is actually fine. And I think with, with so much

167
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:27,215
Speaker 1:  technology, we've actually gotten away from that that everything is

168
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:31,135
Speaker 1:  just like slaby glass rectangles that are made for

169
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:35,055
Speaker 1:  ruthless efficiency and nothing else. So like, even if I don't buy it, which

170
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,935
Speaker 1:  I don't think I will, I, I appreciate the idea that there is one that

171
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:40,855
Speaker 1:  mostly exists just to be the nice one.

172
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:45,895
Speaker 1:  What is tough for me is it does feel like you are making one big

173
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:50,175
Speaker 1:  huge giant sacrifice, which is that there's only one damn camera

174
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:50,775
Speaker 1:  on the thing

175
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:55,775
Speaker 3:  That is the thing. Yeah. And it's, you can sort of

176
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:59,575
Speaker 3:  understand it on like a $600 phone. This

177
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:02,135
Speaker 3:  one is nine ninety nine, so, well this is

178
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:05,575
Speaker 1:  Like the folding phone problem where they're like, oh, well what if, what

179
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:08,895
Speaker 1:  if we had all this other cool stuff, but the most important feature kind

180
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:11,615
Speaker 1:  of sucked and it was more expensive. Do you want that? And people are like,

181
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:11,975
Speaker 1:  no.

182
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,415
Speaker 3:  Right. Yeah. I don't, it does feel like it goes in the opposite

183
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:20,135
Speaker 3:  direction and, and battery too. You know, same with the flip

184
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:24,015
Speaker 3:  phones. You know, they have smaller batteries and that's a

185
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:27,775
Speaker 3:  thing they've had to contend with year after year and they've caught up a

186
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:31,295
Speaker 3:  little bit, but it sort of feels like, yeah, why take a step

187
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:35,135
Speaker 3:  backwards potentially on battery life and camera

188
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:39,935
Speaker 3:  and still pay a thousand dollars for a phone? I think that

189
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:43,335
Speaker 3:  might be a non-starter for, for some people,

190
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:47,895
Speaker 3:  maybe some people really don't care that much about how

191
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:51,815
Speaker 3:  many cameras are on the back or how many of their photos

192
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:52,255
Speaker 3:  are

193
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:57,605
Speaker 3:  two x optical quality zoom

194
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:01,165
Speaker 3:  versus, you know, with the main standard

195
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:05,325
Speaker 3:  focal length. Yeah. There's, there are all kinds

196
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,885
Speaker 3:  of people in this world, I guess.

197
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:11,245
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. This phone is a little bit like death by a thousand

198
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:14,925
Speaker 1:  cuts is too strong, but it is, there are just, it has a lot of little

199
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:19,085
Speaker 1:  dings against it in the service of being like really

200
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:22,805
Speaker 1:  beautiful and really thin. And again, that that's fine.

201
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:26,525
Speaker 1:  Right? Like they make other phones. I think if this was The iPhone

202
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:30,685
Speaker 1:  17, I think we'd have a big problem. Yeah. But the fact that this is

203
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:34,645
Speaker 1:  something different, I actually think is, is great. And I will be fascinated

204
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:36,725
Speaker 1:  to see how it does. And it's made me think a lot about like

205
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:41,765
Speaker 1:  the, the Tesla Roadster and even like the Vision Pro

206
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:45,885
Speaker 1:  and this thing that some companies do where they're like, we are just going

207
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:49,605
Speaker 1:  to make this thing because we can and it's going to be the

208
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:53,525
Speaker 1:  best it can be. And typically it's like wildly expensive.

209
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:56,845
Speaker 1:  I actually expected the air to be significantly more expensive than it is.

210
00:12:56,845 --> 00:13:00,765
Speaker 1:  Like this thing would almost make more sense to me at like $1,500 than

211
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:04,725
Speaker 1:  it does at 9 99. But to say basically like we've built

212
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:08,485
Speaker 1:  some really interesting technology here, and this is, this is my optimistic

213
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,685
Speaker 1:  thesis about The iPhone error is that this thing is like a science project,

214
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:15,525
Speaker 1:  right? This is, this is tech that you have to develop if you're Apple in

215
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:18,405
Speaker 1:  order to do lots of things, right? A bunch of people have pointed out that

216
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,765
Speaker 1:  inside the camera bump on The iPhone error is essentially the

217
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:26,605
Speaker 1:  whole thing. So you, you've put a massive amount of compute

218
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:30,405
Speaker 1:  power and all this stuff into a very tiny sliver of the device,

219
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:33,925
Speaker 1:  which is the kind of thing that you have to continue to miniaturize if you

220
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:37,405
Speaker 1:  want to do all the other things that Apple presumably wants to do with

221
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:41,245
Speaker 1:  robots and glasses and wearables and everything else. Like you can sort of

222
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:44,965
Speaker 1:  pry this thing open and see where it wants to go with lots of different devices.

223
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:47,205
Speaker 1:  This is what you have to do to make a flip phone that really works. This

224
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:49,925
Speaker 1:  is what you have to do to make a foldable phone that really works a lot of

225
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:53,565
Speaker 1:  the work it did on the, the titanium frame and making this thing

226
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:57,445
Speaker 1:  durable and this is the stuff you have to do to do all of that stuff. So

227
00:13:57,445 --> 00:14:00,925
Speaker 1:  it's like, if this is basically all the tech they had to build

228
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:04,605
Speaker 1:  anyway, that they just put into a nice looking phone that they'll, they'll

229
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:08,365
Speaker 1:  sell you in the meantime. That's cool. My

230
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:11,005
Speaker 1:  cynical take is basically what you already just said, which is that they've

231
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,605
Speaker 1:  completely run out of ideas and they're like, well we can make it kind of

232
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:17,565
Speaker 1:  thinner. Is that anything? And I, I would say I'm

233
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:22,255
Speaker 1:  in the, I'm fully in the 50 50 camp where I think it is, it is very

234
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:24,255
Speaker 1:  much both of those things simultaneously.

235
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:28,375
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah, I think so too. And I, I think Apple's had a tough time

236
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,815
Speaker 3:  figuring out that kind of second

237
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:36,695
Speaker 3:  standard iPhone there. We had the mini, you know, rested soul

238
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:40,455
Speaker 3:  and then we had the plus models and it didn't sound like

239
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:44,615
Speaker 3:  those sold as well as Apple wanted them to.

240
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,815
Speaker 3:  So they're like, well what do we have to lose? And I think, I

241
00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:52,685
Speaker 3:  think there really is something too, if you're developing a

242
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:56,405
Speaker 3:  thin phone for a folding phone, like

243
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,205
Speaker 3:  why not put it out there now? And this is

244
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:02,285
Speaker 3:  yeah. Kind of a good testing ground.

245
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:06,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I don't hate it. Like I, I really hope we, we look at all of these

246
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:08,605
Speaker 1:  phones in like twenty, twenty seven, twenty twenty eight and you can, you

247
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:11,565
Speaker 1:  can point right back to The iPhone Air and see where all that stuff started.

248
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:15,845
Speaker 1:  Like, I, I hope that is where all of this lands. Let's talk about the phones

249
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:19,405
Speaker 1:  people are actually gonna buy because I, I think I, I'm like sincerely looking

250
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:22,285
Speaker 1:  forward to seeing how many people buy the air because I suspect a lot of

251
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:24,765
Speaker 1:  people are going to go to an Apple store and look at it and leave with a

252
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:28,685
Speaker 1:  different phone. That is 100% my plan and I'm very

253
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:32,285
Speaker 1:  excited about it. But let's start with The iPhone 17, which I actually think

254
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:36,445
Speaker 1:  this is an interesting play for Apple here to try and figure out

255
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:40,205
Speaker 1:  its normal phone. So last year I bought a 16, yeah. After

256
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:44,085
Speaker 1:  years of buying pros, I bought a regular 16 because I wanted, I

257
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:47,725
Speaker 1:  wanted it to be blue And I love this blue phone to death,

258
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:51,895
Speaker 1:  even though everything about it is worse than the pro

259
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:56,135
Speaker 1:  and, and it, it felt like a huge sacrifice to get a blue phone. And it was,

260
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:59,935
Speaker 1:  and this is the life that I have chosen for myself. The 17

261
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,935
Speaker 1:  feels closer to having the right

262
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:08,015
Speaker 1:  set of features for almost everybody than it has in a long time.

263
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:10,895
Speaker 1:  So lemme lemme just run down a bunch of them for you because

264
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:14,775
Speaker 1:  God only knows what numbers you are able to remember at this time of day.

265
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:19,655
Speaker 1:  So it's, it's just The iPhone 17, like you mentioned. No, plus our,

266
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:23,295
Speaker 1:  our whole theory about big cheap screens was evidently just dead wrong.

267
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:27,935
Speaker 1:  The iPhone plus is, is at least for now, no longer starts at

268
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:31,815
Speaker 1:  $799, starts with 256 kids of storage as an

269
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:35,615
Speaker 1:  a 19 chip. It has a 6.3 inch display, which is an

270
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:38,655
Speaker 1:  incorrect decision because you And I both agree that 6.1 inches is the correct

271
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,935
Speaker 1:  size for a smartphone screen. And Apple blew it on that one.

272
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:46,695
Speaker 1:  It has a promotion screen, which it seemed like they gendered a lot of

273
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,655
Speaker 1:  enthusiasm in the Steve Jobs theater today.

274
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,695
Speaker 3:  Actual cheering, there was real cheering. Yeah.

275
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:56,735
Speaker 1:  It's got the always on display stuff. It has better scratch resistance. It

276
00:16:56,735 --> 00:17:00,175
Speaker 1:  has substantially longer battery life, which I think is really interesting.

277
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:02,135
Speaker 1:  Upgraded cameras,

278
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:07,575
Speaker 1:  slightly faster. Wireless charging, it's a little heavier, it has more

279
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:11,535
Speaker 1:  Bluetooth. It's just like, you know, bits and bobs have changed around the

280
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:15,015
Speaker 1:  edges, but like fundamentally the thing is like a, a better,

281
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:19,335
Speaker 1:  faster, more durable, longer lasting iPhone, which feels

282
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:23,095
Speaker 1:  like roughly the list of things I would've actually asked Apple to do.

283
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:24,815
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Which is great.

284
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:29,255
Speaker 3:  I know it's, it feels like a good year. And I said this last year for the

285
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:33,175
Speaker 3:  16, which was catching up a little bit and

286
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:36,935
Speaker 3:  it felt like a good year. I think it really is a good year for the, for the

287
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:40,575
Speaker 3:  regular iPhone 17 getting the promotion

288
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,175
Speaker 3:  display. Like thank God our national nightmare is over.

289
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:48,255
Speaker 3:  There's, I think our, our colleague Dominic Preston pointed

290
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:51,525
Speaker 3:  out in some of our coverage that you can get a

291
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,525
Speaker 3:  120 heart display on like a $200

292
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:59,085
Speaker 3:  Android phone. Yeah. You know, it was time. So it's here.

293
00:17:59,345 --> 00:17:59,565
Speaker 3:  And

294
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:02,525
Speaker 1:  I will say just a real quick PSA to anyone who is wondering what is a promotion

295
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:06,485
Speaker 1:  display, what is the difference? Don't find out if you don't

296
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:09,925
Speaker 1:  know the difference. Yeah. Don't ever find out

297
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:14,045
Speaker 1:  like you're gonna be like, oh, let me hold the phone that I have next to

298
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,965
Speaker 1:  a promotion display. Don't do that. No, because once you see the

299
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:21,445
Speaker 1:  difference, it ruins it for you. But if you don't see the difference, like

300
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:25,045
Speaker 1:  God bless your life is going to be better for not knowing the difference

301
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:28,845
Speaker 1:  between a 60 hertz and 120 hertz display. Yeah. But once you see it, you

302
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:32,685
Speaker 1:  can never unsee it. And I now see it every time I turn

303
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:33,885
Speaker 1:  on my iPhone 16

304
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:35,845
Speaker 3:  And yeah. Oh

305
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:38,405
Speaker 1:  True. I came on this podcast a year ago and said, I don't care. And boy was

306
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:38,685
Speaker 1:  I wrong.

307
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:43,485
Speaker 3:  No, you care. A year later. Oh, that was the great experiment. It's, it is

308
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:47,125
Speaker 3:  like a curse in a horror movie where once you are

309
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,045
Speaker 3:  burdened with the knowledge, it it just follows you. Yeah.

310
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:55,565
Speaker 3:  So thank God promotion display is here. I

311
00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:59,765
Speaker 3:  know you are not partial to the always on display. I love an

312
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:03,725
Speaker 3:  always on display. Every time I switch from an iPhone

313
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,445
Speaker 3:  that has an always on display to the one that doesn't, I've,

314
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:11,245
Speaker 3:  I keep thinking it shut itself off. I, I'm like, why is this

315
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:12,485
Speaker 3:  phone dead? Interesting. Yeah.

316
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,125
Speaker 1:  Wait, so I have the exact opposite experience. This is so funny. So I think

317
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:19,165
Speaker 1:  I'm not against an always on display. I think the way the Pixel doesn't always

318
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:23,045
Speaker 1:  on display right. Is exactly correct. Like show me the time

319
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:27,165
Speaker 1:  and like the, the barest bit of information from a notification that is,

320
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:30,605
Speaker 1:  that is what I want from an always on display. My problem with the iPhone's

321
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:33,325
Speaker 1:  version of the Always on display has been that I turn my screen off and it

322
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:34,285
Speaker 1:  still feels like it's on.

323
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:35,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

324
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:38,565
Speaker 1:  And, and try as I might, I have never been able to get used to the thing

325
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:42,245
Speaker 1:  where my screen, like granted it's called an always on

326
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:46,125
Speaker 1:  display, but it just feels like it's on And I find myself instinctively

327
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,205
Speaker 1:  going to turn the screen off over and over and over and over and over throughout

328
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:53,085
Speaker 1:  the day. Oh yeah. And I, I always end up turning it off before I get

329
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:56,965
Speaker 1:  used to the feature. Okay. But I will say I, I have come

330
00:19:56,965 --> 00:20:00,085
Speaker 1:  to believe that I'm in the minority of that And I think most people

331
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:05,245
Speaker 1:  like the thing where they can look over and sort of get a

332
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,565
Speaker 1:  rough sense of their phone without picking up their phone. Yeah. And I think

333
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:11,325
Speaker 1:  that's probably a good thing for the world too. And so like yeah,

334
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,485
Speaker 1:  this feels like a good feature to have everywhere.

335
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:17,845
Speaker 3:  I think so. Yeah. And the wallpaper, if you're not used to

336
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:21,725
Speaker 3:  the, the dimmed wallpaper and it sort of depends on what you

337
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:25,405
Speaker 3:  have on some, some wallpapers you're like, yeah, this is not

338
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:28,525
Speaker 3:  off enough of an always on display.

339
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:33,965
Speaker 3:  So super glad that's here. I am always, I don't

340
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:37,925
Speaker 3:  know if I just get my hopes up when companies say that

341
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:41,725
Speaker 3:  their screens are more scratch resistant

342
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:46,285
Speaker 3:  every single year. I'm like, this is my year. I always get scratches

343
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:49,925
Speaker 3:  on the screen. I'm just a reckless, I put my

344
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:53,805
Speaker 3:  car keys next to the phone in a fanny pack and they're just

345
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:58,885
Speaker 3:  touching each other, but they're making, you know, big claims

346
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:02,965
Speaker 3:  about how scratch resistant the Tomic Shield is.

347
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:07,805
Speaker 3:  So yeah. Good things coming to the basic

348
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:11,605
Speaker 3:  iPhone. I'm gonna shout out the SAGE on the regular iPhone

349
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:14,325
Speaker 3:  looks great. Oh, And I really like it.

350
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:16,645
Speaker 1:  Is that the one they call natural, which is

351
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,125
Speaker 3:  Just the stupidest No, they call,

352
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,165
Speaker 1:  They call it s it was an actual sage,

353
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:23,165
Speaker 3:  Which I'm pretty sure they're, we've had a sage pixel, so

354
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:23,965
Speaker 3:  love

355
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:27,085
Speaker 1:  This. They're just come around, I come around. I do appreciate the push towards

356
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:30,885
Speaker 1:  the like slightly earthy colors. I, I have actually, I have come to enjoy

357
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:34,685
Speaker 1:  that very much. It's coming. Does the base iPhone 17

358
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,805
Speaker 1:  have the awesome new front camera?

359
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:39,285
Speaker 3:  Yes. They all, okay. Can we talk about

360
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:43,205
Speaker 1:  This for a second? This seems super cool. Can you explain like what this

361
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,525
Speaker 1:  new selfie camera is up to?

362
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:48,845
Speaker 3:  Yeah, so it's a new 18 megapixel sensor

363
00:21:49,345 --> 00:21:52,765
Speaker 3:  and it is a square format sensor.

364
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:57,285
Speaker 3:  So rather than having to turn the whole phone

365
00:21:57,425 --> 00:22:01,165
Speaker 3:  to do switch between like portrait and landscape mode, it can

366
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:05,125
Speaker 3:  do it in sensor and it doesn't lose a bunch of

367
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:09,205
Speaker 3:  resolution in the process. So you can do this,

368
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:13,685
Speaker 3:  you know, you frame up a selfie and you can tap a couple of icons

369
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:16,885
Speaker 3:  on the screen to expand or rotate the picture.

370
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:22,005
Speaker 3:  Or you can have it, you know, its center stage where

371
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:26,165
Speaker 3:  it will kind of follow you around the frame automatically or it'll do the

372
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,925
Speaker 3:  rotating by itself. So if someone joins,

373
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:34,485
Speaker 3:  joins you in the photo, it'll just go boop and you'll both be in it.

374
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:38,365
Speaker 1:  This might sound like slight hyperbole, but I honestly think

375
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:42,645
Speaker 1:  the ability to take landscape selfies while holding your phone in

376
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:46,705
Speaker 1:  portrait is like the most exciting iPhone

377
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:47,825
Speaker 1:  upgrade in years.

378
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,625
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It might change

379
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,905
Speaker 1:  Truly because it's, it's, it's the sort of thing,

380
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:50,625
Speaker 3:  Everything

381
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:54,505
Speaker 1:  All the time landscape selfies always look worse because the cameras suddenly

382
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:57,025
Speaker 1:  off to the side and half the people in the selfie are looking to this side

383
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:59,185
Speaker 1:  of the camera and half the people are looking to this side of the camera.

384
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:03,345
Speaker 1:  Nobody is correctly looking at the camera. Yeah. Everything just looks

385
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:07,505
Speaker 1:  wrong. You're not able to get as far away and hold it as naturally. So like

386
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:10,505
Speaker 1:  this thing where you can hold your phone the way your phone is meant to be

387
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:14,465
Speaker 1:  held and take whatever kind of photo you want, I think is

388
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:18,225
Speaker 1:  like amazing. Yes. I think center stage is like kind of a

389
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:22,145
Speaker 1:  wacky feature. It, it makes more sense to me on, on iPhone frankly, than

390
00:23:22,215 --> 00:23:26,185
Speaker 1:  most because people tend to be sort of all over the place as they're

391
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:29,385
Speaker 1:  holding their iPhone. Like sometimes I FaceTime with my nephew and he's just

392
00:23:29,385 --> 00:23:32,305
Speaker 1:  literally like holding it at his side and so I'm just looking sort of up

393
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:36,305
Speaker 1:  the side of his face. Yeah. And so the idea of like trying to solve some

394
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:39,865
Speaker 1:  of these problems makes a lot of sense. But truly just the square sensor

395
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:41,785
Speaker 1:  alone I think is just genius.

396
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:45,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I am here for it. I, whenever I'm changing

397
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:49,925
Speaker 3:  between, you know, selfie camera orientations, I feel like I

398
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:53,805
Speaker 3:  always have something else in my hand. I have to put something down and I'm

399
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:57,645
Speaker 3:  like holding, like totally adjusting the, the way I am holding

400
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:01,525
Speaker 3:  the phone. So yeah, I think there was a lot of kind like oohs and

401
00:24:02,145 --> 00:24:05,165
Speaker 3:  ah, from the crowd when they talked about this one. So

402
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:09,365
Speaker 1:  I'll say it means I will never ever use the camera control as a shutter button

403
00:24:09,435 --> 00:24:12,325
Speaker 1:  ever again. True. The only time I ever use it is for landscape photos. Oh,

404
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,005
Speaker 1:  that's, and there is absolutely no reason I will ever touch it again.

405
00:24:15,465 --> 00:24:17,005
Speaker 3:  Oh, RIP camera control

406
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:21,085
Speaker 1:  Right now. It's just only going to be by accident instead of mostly

407
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:22,085
Speaker 1:  by accident.

408
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:22,565
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

409
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:27,645
Speaker 1:  So let's, let's talk about the, the Pro and Pro Max, both of which still

410
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:30,805
Speaker 1:  exist. Only the plus got got the ax this time.

411
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:36,245
Speaker 1:  The, the story here I think is kind of the same usually as the Pro and

412
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:38,205
Speaker 1:  Pro Max Better camera

413
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:43,645
Speaker 1:  niftier, you know, hardware features. They talked a lot

414
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:47,525
Speaker 1:  about a vapor chamber and vapor cooled performance. None of

415
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:50,885
Speaker 1:  which means anything to a real person who just wants to use their phone,

416
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:54,525
Speaker 1:  but I'm sure is like neat and cool. The thing that is the most

417
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:57,525
Speaker 1:  interesting I think about the design is they have extended the camera bump

418
00:24:57,985 --> 00:25:01,565
Speaker 1:  all the way across the back again. You've, you've seen it. This is new for

419
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:03,085
Speaker 1:  an iPhone. How does it look?

420
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,525
Speaker 3:  It looks All right. I was sort of unsure with, you

421
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:11,445
Speaker 3:  know, there, the rumors about this redesign have been coming

422
00:25:11,505 --> 00:25:14,645
Speaker 3:  in for a while and it's hard to tell,

423
00:25:15,345 --> 00:25:19,325
Speaker 3:  you know, from pictures, they, apple really did make a lot of

424
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:19,685
Speaker 3:  the,

425
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:25,445
Speaker 3:  they started from scratch. You know, when they in the presentation

426
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:30,005
Speaker 3:  you just see like a big chunk of aluminum. You're like, oh

427
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:32,845
Speaker 3:  yeah, we're gonna mill the shit outta that aluminum.

428
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:35,805
Speaker 1:  I bet this is gonna be smaller later. It was

429
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:39,925
Speaker 3:  Gonna be sick. Yeah. They made a phone out of it. But there is kind of a,

430
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:43,965
Speaker 3:  a, a cohesive element to the body and the, the

431
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:47,605
Speaker 3:  camera bump, they are calling it a camera plateau. I refuse to

432
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:51,445
Speaker 3:  acknowledge this. I will not look directly at it. And I'm gonna call a camera

433
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:52,645
Speaker 3:  bump. That's what it's,

434
00:25:52,825 --> 00:25:55,325
Speaker 1:  It is a, it is a, it is a bump for a camera. That's

435
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:59,325
Speaker 3:  Exactly, don't, yes. Don't make it like geography. Yeah.

436
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:02,605
Speaker 1:  It doesn't have to be a thing. It's fine. No. Although I said this about

437
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:05,645
Speaker 1:  the dynamic island for like a year and a half and now I just un ironically

438
00:26:05,645 --> 00:26:08,605
Speaker 1:  say the dynamic island and every time I do, I know I hate myself a little

439
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:10,805
Speaker 1:  more. So I assume, yeah, this will happen with a plateau as well.

440
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:12,605
Speaker 3:  Probably. This

441
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:15,125
Speaker 1:  Is one of those things that I, I know a bunch of people were like having,

442
00:26:15,505 --> 00:26:19,445
Speaker 1:  you know, thoughts about as an Apple design thing. And it is to

443
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,645
Speaker 1:  be clear, the last company to decide to do this.

444
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:26,565
Speaker 1:  Everybody else has been doing the full width camera bump for a while now.

445
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:31,165
Speaker 1:  I'm fine with it. I think I, I've been using the, the Pixel 10 Pro a bunch

446
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:35,325
Speaker 1:  for the last few days and a, it makes

447
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:39,285
Speaker 1:  cases make more sense. Like the, this just looks nicer to have a

448
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:42,645
Speaker 1:  case with the thing all the way across. And then also

449
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:47,325
Speaker 1:  it sits caseless better. Like, it, it is at that little tiny bit of

450
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:50,085
Speaker 1:  an angle instead of being the teeny tiny bit of wobbly that The iPhone has

451
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:53,965
Speaker 1:  always been. And it, it just, it, it just seems fine

452
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:57,445
Speaker 1:  to me. Like yeah, I am completely unbothered by this decision that Apple

453
00:26:57,445 --> 00:27:00,245
Speaker 1:  made. And I think if anything it actually looks visually

454
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:04,085
Speaker 1:  less asymmetrical in a way that I really like.

455
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:07,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. I'm into it. I think the, the thing that

456
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:11,965
Speaker 3:  I, in person, I was caught off guard more by,

457
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:16,925
Speaker 3:  so the, the body of the phone itself is aluminum. They went back to

458
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:20,605
Speaker 3:  the aluminum Yep. The chunk of aluminum. No titanium.

459
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:24,285
Speaker 3:  They kind of walked away from that. The air is titanium, but

460
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:29,565
Speaker 3:  so pros aluminum, but a big chunk of the back panel

461
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:31,045
Speaker 3:  is that ceramic shield,

462
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:33,045
Speaker 1:  Like the same stuff on the front.

463
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:37,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And it's, so it's not glass and it's

464
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:41,885
Speaker 3:  colored like the phone, but it's sort of, they're

465
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:45,405
Speaker 3:  different materials. So they have kind of a different

466
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:49,605
Speaker 3:  interesting look to them. It almost looks like a, it's

467
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,725
Speaker 3:  like a two-tone thing where you're like, this is an orange

468
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:57,045
Speaker 3:  phone with a cool little orange thing in the middle of it.

469
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:01,925
Speaker 3:  The idea is that it won't crack and splinter into

470
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:05,925
Speaker 3:  a million pieces when your 4-year-old, which is good,

471
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:08,885
Speaker 3:  drops it on some concrete. I'm not pointing any fingers,

472
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:15,285
Speaker 3:  but I did walk around Apple Park with this phone in a

473
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:19,365
Speaker 3:  phone case because my review unit of 16 pro

474
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:23,205
Speaker 3:  is shattered. Oh no. Yeah. Not a great look.

475
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:26,045
Speaker 3:  It's tough. Yeah, it's tough out there for a phone.

476
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:30,125
Speaker 1:  I've only ever destroyed one review unit and it was, it was, it was an

477
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,925
Speaker 1:  iPhone that I was, I I will, this is like seared

478
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:37,565
Speaker 1:  into my brain. I was in the Safeway grocery store

479
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:41,805
Speaker 1:  And I took my phone out to look at my grocery list. Went, okay, cool,

480
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:45,445
Speaker 1:  I'm ready to go. I have everything I need. Went to put it in my pocket, missed

481
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:49,365
Speaker 1:  my pocket, and literally just threw the phone onto the ground and it

482
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:53,005
Speaker 1:  like, it essentially exploded into a thousand pieces in

483
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:56,805
Speaker 1:  on the floor of the Safeway. And so I took a picture And I sent it to the

484
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:59,085
Speaker 1:  Apple comms people And I was like, I don't know what you want me to do with

485
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:02,125
Speaker 1:  this. Right? But I'm happy to mail all of these pieces of

486
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,085
Speaker 3:  Glass to you. Oh God. Did, did they have to get the broom out where they

487
00:29:05,085 --> 00:29:05,805
Speaker 3:  like clean up

488
00:29:06,515 --> 00:29:09,845
Speaker 1:  Produce? No, but I did produce ask somebody for a paper towel so that I could,

489
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:10,845
Speaker 1:  I could bring

490
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:11,245
Speaker 3:  The

491
00:29:11,265 --> 00:29:15,085
Speaker 1:  Pieces together. It was tough. But anyway, just know that you're not alone

492
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:17,365
Speaker 1:  and this, this happens. Thank you. This this happens to all of us. Yeah,

493
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:20,685
Speaker 1:  yeah. But I agree in all of these cases, I think a, an actually

494
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:24,885
Speaker 1:  interesting through line of a lot of apple's announcements today was

495
00:29:25,425 --> 00:29:29,365
Speaker 1:  things that are more durable. And I think that's great. Like that is, that

496
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:33,325
Speaker 1:  is a company that realizes that people keeps these things longer and

497
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:36,685
Speaker 1:  is okay with that and wants to make that work for them. And I think that

498
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:40,485
Speaker 1:  rules, like I'm, I'm very happy about this. Yeah. Can we talk about the pro

499
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:44,425
Speaker 1:  cameras for just a minute? Because good thing about the pro cameras,

500
00:29:44,455 --> 00:29:48,385
Speaker 1:  there's three of them. They're all 48 megapixels. Now, bad thing about

501
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:51,825
Speaker 1:  the cameras, apple has used that fact to do a bunch of insane math about

502
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:54,705
Speaker 1:  cameras. That doesn't make any sense to me. And you're a person who understands

503
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:57,265
Speaker 1:  cameras better than I do. So what I don't understand is how are there three

504
00:29:57,265 --> 00:30:01,025
Speaker 1:  cameras but also eight cameras and it all feels like lies.

505
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,465
Speaker 1:  Can you explain what's going on here to me?

506
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:05,745
Speaker 3:  I know. So yeah, how did we get here?

507
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:10,865
Speaker 3:  It started with, you know, the, the

508
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:14,745
Speaker 3:  48 megapixel sensor has enough resolution

509
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:18,905
Speaker 3:  that you can crop and use the middle of it and

510
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:23,745
Speaker 3:  not have to upscale it to zoom in. So you can get a

511
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:27,065
Speaker 3:  two times optical quality zoom

512
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:30,385
Speaker 3:  air quotes, this is Apple's term for it,

513
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:33,465
Speaker 1:  Which is not the same thing as optical zoom, as you have said before on this

514
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,345
Speaker 1:  podcast. It's just cropping. It is

515
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:35,865
Speaker 3:  Cropping.

516
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:39,585
Speaker 1:  It's just cropping. It can be good cropping, but it's still just cropping.

517
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:43,545
Speaker 3:  Good cropping. They will of course say they do, they have

518
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:47,265
Speaker 3:  a special pipeline for it and it's really wonderful and beautiful.

519
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:52,225
Speaker 3:  So it's been doing that in the one x camera and

520
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:55,705
Speaker 3:  you can get these other kind of like 35

521
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:59,425
Speaker 3:  millimeter equivalent focal links with sort of similar stuff going on.

522
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:02,905
Speaker 3:  They've been doing that. There's the wide angle camera of course.

523
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:07,185
Speaker 3:  And then upgrading the telephoto camera to 48

524
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:08,465
Speaker 3:  megapixels this year.

525
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:13,865
Speaker 3:  And out at the same time, downgrading the zoom from five

526
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:17,745
Speaker 3:  x to four x or the, the, oh yeah. Focal length. It's not

527
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:20,785
Speaker 3:  zooming, they just copy and pasted the same

528
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:25,185
Speaker 3:  concept over the telephoto where they're like, we can crop

529
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:28,665
Speaker 3:  in the middle and give you an eight times

530
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:33,265
Speaker 3:  optical quality zoom. We didn't do any digital

531
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:36,905
Speaker 3:  zoom upscaling. You won't see any

532
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,265
Speaker 3:  gross artifacts from that kind of thing. Although you can do

533
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:44,425
Speaker 3:  digital zoom to 40 times and it's not good.

534
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:47,305
Speaker 1:  And then it'll do weird AI shenanigans. Oh yeah.

535
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:49,905
Speaker 3:  Oh boy. Yeah. It's a can of worms. Yeah.

536
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:55,005
Speaker 1:  Okay. I mean on the one hand it's,

537
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:58,645
Speaker 1:  it's all marketing lies and we should say so. But on the other hand,

538
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:03,085
Speaker 1:  I I I think a lot about like the, just the regular people I see using their

539
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:06,685
Speaker 1:  phone and, and it is such a common behavior still

540
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,885
Speaker 1:  to pinch and zoom on your phone to 3.6 x

541
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:14,765
Speaker 1:  and then take the picture. Right. And it's like my heart dies

542
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:17,405
Speaker 1:  a little bit every time I see somebody do that because it's, I'm like, oh,

543
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:21,205
Speaker 1:  you've just made your picture worse when you could have just done that later.

544
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:25,485
Speaker 1:  But actually you, they don't understand that and nor should they have to.

545
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:29,685
Speaker 1:  And in some ways Apple is making that process cleaner,

546
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:33,045
Speaker 1:  right? Yeah. Like it's, it's saying we're gonna give you options that are

547
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:36,725
Speaker 1:  optimized and are going to make more sense so that you can do these things

548
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:40,605
Speaker 1:  that are destructive and they're going to make your image worse,

549
00:32:41,465 --> 00:32:44,885
Speaker 1:  but in a, in a way that we are going to take slightly better care of you

550
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:48,685
Speaker 1:  for. And I think that's something I don't, yeah, I dunno how much that is,

551
00:32:48,685 --> 00:32:49,565
Speaker 1:  but it feels like something

552
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:52,605
Speaker 3:  And, and it gives you the little buttons at the bottom of the screen that

553
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:55,525
Speaker 3:  makes it simple. It's like one x two x, you know,

554
00:32:56,435 --> 00:33:00,085
Speaker 3:  four x we, we understand that I can push a button that says two x

555
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:04,605
Speaker 3:  rather than Yeah. Pinch and zoom to something between two and three

556
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:08,565
Speaker 3:  that's gonna look kind of crappy for no good reason. It just, it hurts

557
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:12,685
Speaker 3:  every time. I know I'd, I sit there and cringe when

558
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:16,085
Speaker 3:  they're like eight lenses in your pocket.

559
00:33:16,585 --> 00:33:20,365
Speaker 3:  But the, the reality is like, it's,

560
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:24,485
Speaker 3:  it's better than just a a, a free for all of digital zoom,

561
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:25,165
Speaker 3:  I think. Sure.

562
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:29,405
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And if you, if they would just call it like camera simulators, it would

563
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:31,445
Speaker 1:  be fine. Yeah. Right. Because that's essentially what it is, right? It's

564
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:35,365
Speaker 1:  it's, you're you're doing presets and those presets are designed

565
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:38,805
Speaker 1:  to simulate the experience of certain kinds of camera that I think is great.

566
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:41,725
Speaker 1:  I have no problem with that. Lots of camera apps do that and do it well and

567
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:44,845
Speaker 1:  are like, oh, we're gonna do x, y, Z filter to make it look like a film camera.

568
00:33:45,285 --> 00:33:48,525
Speaker 1:  I have no problem with that. Just don't say your three lenses are eight lenses

569
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:51,685
Speaker 1:  because they're not like that's it, that's that's my only, that's my only

570
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:55,045
Speaker 1:  gripe. I can look at the phone and see how many lenses there are. Yeah. We

571
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:56,645
Speaker 1:  don't need to do any more work than that

572
00:33:57,505 --> 00:34:01,285
Speaker 3:  As someone who carried around a big heavy actual

573
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:04,725
Speaker 3:  zoom lens with a lot of actual focal lengths.

574
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:08,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I I take issue with that. Yeah.

575
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:12,405
Speaker 1:  That said, I do think there's a strong chance this camera is going to be

576
00:34:12,405 --> 00:34:16,365
Speaker 1:  very good. It, it has a bunch of new, you know, it does, it does ProRes raw,

577
00:34:16,365 --> 00:34:19,725
Speaker 1:  it does log two, it does genlock. It's got the simultaneous front and back

578
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:20,965
Speaker 1:  recording, which I think is very cool.

579
00:34:22,555 --> 00:34:26,205
Speaker 1:  Like this continues to be a camera phone in a very real way for

580
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:30,205
Speaker 1:  Apple. And I think that makes a lot of sense. What

581
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:34,245
Speaker 1:  I wonder particularly about with the Pro and Pro Max

582
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:35,685
Speaker 1:  this year is

583
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:41,005
Speaker 1:  how sort of far that still goes, right? Like

584
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:44,925
Speaker 1:  it's, it's, it is better. There's no question it is better, but the biggest

585
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:48,165
Speaker 1:  problem that I think people have had with

586
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:52,725
Speaker 1:  Apple cameras, especially for the last one or

587
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:56,645
Speaker 1:  two revs of The iPhone, is like apple's ideas about what makes good

588
00:34:56,645 --> 00:35:00,525
Speaker 1:  photos. And I think it, it's so much about the imaging pipeline that Apple

589
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:03,485
Speaker 1:  has decided and this thing where they're like, we are going to crush all

590
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,965
Speaker 1:  of the dynamic range and make sure there's no shadows and make sure every

591
00:35:05,965 --> 00:35:09,645
Speaker 1:  photo is usable. That like this idea that people have, that their phone

592
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:13,525
Speaker 1:  photos are getting worse is not about the hardware, it's about apple's ideas

593
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:16,565
Speaker 1:  about what your photos are supposed to look like. And even just looking at

594
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:19,845
Speaker 1:  the sample photos and stuff here, it's like, are maybe we're just pointing

595
00:35:19,845 --> 00:35:23,005
Speaker 1:  even better hardware at that exact same problem And I just don't know.

596
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:27,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I have a lot of conflicting feelings about it because

597
00:35:27,485 --> 00:35:31,165
Speaker 3:  yeah, we've all seen the, the over HDR look, the

598
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:34,845
Speaker 3:  crunchiness. I talked to Mark LaVoy a couple

599
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:38,685
Speaker 3:  weeks ago kind of about that problem

600
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:42,165
Speaker 3:  with, with phone cameras in general. And he

601
00:35:42,595 --> 00:35:46,405
Speaker 3:  pointed out, you know, that their job is to make

602
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:50,445
Speaker 3:  the photo readable on screens of different sizes in

603
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:54,285
Speaker 3:  different lighting conditions. And you know, I think, I think we know

604
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:58,165
Speaker 3:  that. I'm like, yeah, that's why everything in the foreground

605
00:35:58,165 --> 00:36:02,125
Speaker 3:  looks brightened and because Apple can't be in

606
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:05,805
Speaker 3:  trouble when your relative was like in

607
00:36:05,945 --> 00:36:09,765
Speaker 3:  the shadows in this photo, does it make

608
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:12,805
Speaker 3:  for a camera that people actively like

609
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:18,245
Speaker 3:  is another thing. The Apple is still, they've got

610
00:36:18,265 --> 00:36:22,125
Speaker 3:  the, the photographic styles and they've sort of gone here,

611
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:26,205
Speaker 3:  it's your problem now where you, you dial in kind

612
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:29,805
Speaker 3:  of how you like skin tones. You do like contrast you like,

613
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:35,125
Speaker 3:  you know, and actual HDR in your

614
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:38,565
Speaker 3:  photos And I don't think they've solved anything.

615
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:43,125
Speaker 3:  It's there if you know how to go change those things and what

616
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:43,605
Speaker 3:  they mean.

617
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:46,685
Speaker 1:  And there's a subset of users that will do that, right? Like you can buy

618
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:50,405
Speaker 1:  the Pro Max all the way up to, I think it's two grand with a, with two

619
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:53,485
Speaker 1:  terabytes of storage. The people who are gonna buy that phone are the people

620
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:57,445
Speaker 1:  who are going to go in and, and dial this stuff in in a

621
00:36:57,445 --> 00:37:01,005
Speaker 1:  way that works. And I think I've long been a proponent that Apple should

622
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:04,725
Speaker 1:  give people more control of their devices. And so like, yay, that's great.

623
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:08,445
Speaker 1:  I'm into that. I really, really wonder in these particular cases,

624
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:13,415
Speaker 1:  if, if Apple is going to give people more

625
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:17,815
Speaker 1:  sort of front and center ways to make things look just better.

626
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:21,375
Speaker 1:  Right? Because I think like your point and Mark's about like

627
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:25,575
Speaker 1:  it is there to prevent you from taking bad photos is a good and

628
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:28,335
Speaker 1:  honorable goal, But that's not the same thing as taking good photos. And

629
00:37:28,535 --> 00:37:32,135
Speaker 1:  I think these phones are designed and they cost like

630
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:36,055
Speaker 1:  they are for people who wanna take good photos and video. And I don't know,

631
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:39,775
Speaker 1:  like as, as you review these things, whenever you get to, I'm, I'm very

632
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:43,615
Speaker 1:  curious how you feel about the actual stuff that's coming

633
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:47,175
Speaker 1:  out of the camera. Yeah. 'cause that's ultimately, like, they're better cameras

634
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:47,895
Speaker 1:  than ever, but

635
00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:52,375
Speaker 1:  Apple still has to make a lot of decisions about them.

636
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:56,375
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. Having feelings about phone cameras is,

637
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:59,895
Speaker 3:  is my jam. So this is what we do here. Yeah. I, yeah.

638
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:03,575
Speaker 1:  All right. Well, I, I should let you go here, but do you, do you have a bet

639
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:07,535
Speaker 1:  on, there's four models here. Do you think there's one that is

640
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:11,455
Speaker 1:  gonna be the like sneaky runaway success hit of the

641
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,335
Speaker 1:  line coming out?

642
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:16,695
Speaker 3:  I think there's gonna be a lot of orange iPhone 17

643
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:20,655
Speaker 3:  pros on the street. I think it's, I think I so too, yeah, it's a real

644
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:24,575
Speaker 3:  vibrant color. It's, it looks nice. I think it's, it's gonna

645
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:25,815
Speaker 3:  be a hit

646
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:29,535
Speaker 1:  And it screams I have the new one in a way that's very hard to do with an

647
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:29,815
Speaker 1:  iPhone

648
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:30,895
Speaker 3:  These days. Exactly. Yeah.

649
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:33,375
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I like it. That's a good take. All right. We need to take a break,

650
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,725
Speaker 1:  Allison, you I'm sure have more stuff to do. Do so. Thank you for coming

651
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:38,605
Speaker 1:  in, doing this with us. Thank you. All right, we'll be right back.

652
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:43,325
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. V song is here. Hi, ve.

653
00:39:43,855 --> 00:39:44,205
Speaker 5:  Hello.

654
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:47,685
Speaker 1:  How are you feeling? Let's just talk about like your mental state for a minute

655
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:47,885
Speaker 1:  here.

656
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:52,805
Speaker 5:  It's ah, that's my mental state. That's, that's

657
00:39:52,945 --> 00:39:54,685
Speaker 5:  that's how it's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:58,605
Speaker 1:  How so thi this is the first iPhone event I have not been at in a while.

659
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:01,285
Speaker 1:  How does this compare? You, you've been doing this for a while. What, what

660
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:02,965
Speaker 1:  were your vibes compared to recent ones?

661
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:07,285
Speaker 5:  It's a little weird to, to be honest, in, in some, in some

662
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:11,045
Speaker 5:  sense it's like, oh, business as usual. And in another sense,

663
00:40:11,405 --> 00:40:15,325
Speaker 5:  I just felt like there was some tension in the air just of like,

664
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:19,475
Speaker 5:  what is on deck? What's happening? And like, I think we all had

665
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:23,355
Speaker 5:  a sense that the air was coming. We knew that watches were coming. I think

666
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:27,555
Speaker 5:  everyone was pretty clear that AirPods were coming. But like, when you walk

667
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:30,275
Speaker 5:  out of it, usually there's like one or two things that you're like, oh, this

668
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:34,035
Speaker 5:  is the, the stuff. And it's now it's like skinny phone and

669
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:37,835
Speaker 5:  orange, which I must say I'm an orange hater. I like,

670
00:40:38,555 --> 00:40:42,195
Speaker 5:  I orange is on my shit list. And I looked at that orange phone And I went,

671
00:40:42,255 --> 00:40:46,215
Speaker 5:  oh, that's a good orange. I'm tempted. Do I want an orange

672
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:49,615
Speaker 5:  phone? Am I gonna have an orange existential crisis? I mean, I have an existential

673
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:52,975
Speaker 5:  crisis every week, but this is my existential crisis. Do I want an orange

674
00:40:52,975 --> 00:40:56,055
Speaker 5:  phone? I don't know. I don't know. I kind of want an orange phone.

675
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,255
Speaker 1:  I do feel like the internet has spent the entirety of today,

676
00:41:00,195 --> 00:41:03,615
Speaker 1:  by and large coming around to the orange phone. I feel like the, the, we

677
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:06,375
Speaker 1:  first saw the orange phone and everybody went like, absolutely not. No, thank

678
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:10,175
Speaker 1:  you. And I, and, and one by one, everyone I saw in Blue Sky

679
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:11,895
Speaker 1:  was like, maybe I like the orange phone.

680
00:41:12,455 --> 00:41:16,255
Speaker 5:  I will say like the leaks that came out, especially, I think I saw one earlier

681
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:20,175
Speaker 5:  today And I was like, is that orange or is that dooo brown? Like a dooo brown

682
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:23,695
Speaker 5:  orange? Because if it's a dooo brown orange, we are gonna have to

683
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:27,935
Speaker 5:  do do that over. But it is, I will say it's not a

684
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:32,015
Speaker 5:  sherbet orange. Like Charles Charles Palmore asked me this. He went,

685
00:41:32,015 --> 00:41:35,845
Speaker 5:  is it spice or is it sherbets? It is spice. Oh, that's good. Spices. Okay.

686
00:41:35,915 --> 00:41:39,885
Speaker 5:  It's like a pumpkin spice, autumn vibes, but

687
00:41:39,905 --> 00:41:43,805
Speaker 5:  bright. And it's, it's just like a quintessential deep orange.

688
00:41:44,105 --> 00:41:47,805
Speaker 5:  And like I said, I am an orange hater. I'm, I'm Miss Purple.

689
00:41:48,065 --> 00:41:51,205
Speaker 5:  I'm the verges foremost expert on good shades of purple.

690
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:55,955
Speaker 5:  And I was like, do I want an orange

691
00:41:56,005 --> 00:41:59,715
Speaker 5:  phone? Do do I want an orange? I this, that's something I'm gonna be asking

692
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:00,835
Speaker 5:  myself for the next few days.

693
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:04,435
Speaker 1:  It is the most important question facing us in America right now. Yeah, I

694
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:06,635
Speaker 1:  would say. Yeah. Yeah. But I wanna talk to you about AirPods And I wanna

695
00:42:06,635 --> 00:42:10,595
Speaker 1:  talk to you about watches. And there we have four products to cover And I

696
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:14,555
Speaker 1:  have them in the order in which I find them interesting. Which is maybe

697
00:42:14,695 --> 00:42:17,715
Speaker 1:  not the order that is going to make sense, but this is just the order we're

698
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:20,955
Speaker 1:  gonna do it, which I think means we need to start with the AirPods first.

699
00:42:21,395 --> 00:42:25,235
Speaker 1:  Because I think to me, the AirPods Pro three were like the single

700
00:42:25,745 --> 00:42:29,155
Speaker 1:  most straightforward, slam dunk, great new product

701
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:32,915
Speaker 1:  at this event. It's, they, they just, I agree with you. They just are good.

702
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:37,035
Speaker 5:  It's, it's just chef's kiss, like, you know,

703
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:41,435
Speaker 5:  optimizer issue one, which I'm just gonna plug here, subscribe.

704
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:45,955
Speaker 5:  But in, in that, I basically was like, I think Apple just needs to give the

705
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:48,955
Speaker 5:  people what they want in general. And I was speaking

706
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:53,195
Speaker 5:  specifically to the watches, but I think the

707
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:57,235
Speaker 5:  AirPods three is just what people want. It's, it's just, you

708
00:42:57,235 --> 00:43:01,115
Speaker 5:  know, genuinely good. I've spent some time with the product. I got to

709
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:05,035
Speaker 5:  test out the A NCI gotta tell you, I was very impressed by

710
00:43:05,035 --> 00:43:08,955
Speaker 5:  the A NC. Like I am wearing the AirPods two, so I'm not

711
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:12,915
Speaker 5:  wearing the three right now. Gross. But yesterday's news.

712
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:17,275
Speaker 5:  But I gotta say I was in the, that little room

713
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:21,315
Speaker 5:  where you have the hands on, you know, David, it, it echoes.

714
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:25,235
Speaker 5:  The music is playing, people are talking, it's

715
00:43:25,265 --> 00:43:29,155
Speaker 5:  loud, you know, they were doing demos on that floor. I

716
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:32,235
Speaker 5:  put them in my, I put them in my ear holes and

717
00:43:32,715 --> 00:43:36,595
Speaker 5:  everything's quiet And I can just hear the dulcet sounds of the F1

718
00:43:36,595 --> 00:43:39,475
Speaker 5:  soundtrack, because that is the playlist that, that had us listen to. Sure,

719
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:40,355
Speaker 5:  of course.

720
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:43,235
Speaker 1:  Wait, but that's pretty impressive. 'cause I would actually, I would compare

721
00:43:43,735 --> 00:43:47,275
Speaker 1:  an Apple hands-on room to like a pretty

722
00:43:47,865 --> 00:43:51,355
Speaker 1:  busy train station. Yes. Right. It's like there's, there's a lot of

723
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:55,755
Speaker 1:  sort of hustle and bustle. There's no like specific loud noise, which

724
00:43:55,755 --> 00:43:58,915
Speaker 1:  is actually in many cases easier to cancel. Yes. It's like the reason they're

725
00:43:58,915 --> 00:44:02,395
Speaker 1:  good on planes is because it's just one noise the whole time. But this is

726
00:44:02,395 --> 00:44:05,955
Speaker 1:  just kind of stuff happening. So to be able to do that

727
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:09,515
Speaker 1:  on a pair of a very small headphones and b

728
00:44:10,305 --> 00:44:14,235
Speaker 1:  like in an environment like that is really impressive. And I think the pros

729
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,355
Speaker 1:  have been impressive for a while at that in part just because they have that

730
00:44:17,425 --> 00:44:21,395
Speaker 1:  seal in your ears. Yeah. But like the, the a NC

731
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:25,235
Speaker 1:  here, they said like the world's best a NC over and over to the point where

732
00:44:25,235 --> 00:44:28,555
Speaker 1:  it's like, I kind of think you're lying, right? But maybe there's something

733
00:44:28,555 --> 00:44:28,835
Speaker 1:  to this.

734
00:44:29,435 --> 00:44:32,765
Speaker 5:  I think there's something to it, especially in this particular form factor.

735
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:36,325
Speaker 5:  Like of course I think it's gonna be really hard to be over your

736
00:44:36,555 --> 00:44:39,965
Speaker 5:  cans. And obviously I have some at home, I'm gonna see how they compare to

737
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:43,525
Speaker 5:  my Sony alphabet soup XM four. Sure. I just know the last three.

738
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:47,765
Speaker 5:  But I will would say that I did notice a different, 'cause I

739
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:51,725
Speaker 5:  use these AirPod pro twos quite frequently, And I did notice

740
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:55,525
Speaker 5:  a difference. And I think it really has to do with the, the fact that they've

741
00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:59,365
Speaker 5:  improved the fit, which my conspiracy theory is, yeah. You know,

742
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:02,645
Speaker 5:  partly they talked a lot about design at this event, and you always know

743
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:06,205
Speaker 5:  that it's gonna be kind of like a hmm, interesting event when design is like

744
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:10,205
Speaker 5:  the thesis that they're, they're coming to it with it, but you know, they're

745
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:13,205
Speaker 5:  like, oh, it fits in your ear more ergonomically. And when you do hold the

746
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:16,845
Speaker 5:  three versus the two in your hand, you can see that there have been like,

747
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:20,685
Speaker 5:  changes to the shape. But my, my pet theory

748
00:45:20,945 --> 00:45:24,605
Speaker 5:  is that when you add heart rate sensors to an

749
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:28,405
Speaker 5:  earbud, you need to nail the fit.

750
00:45:28,705 --> 00:45:32,445
Speaker 5:  If the fit doesn't, if the fit isn't absolutely perfect,

751
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:37,245
Speaker 5:  that particular sensor is useless to you. So I think it's

752
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:40,725
Speaker 5:  like a confluence of things. You want to have the best A and C, but also

753
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:44,725
Speaker 5:  having a really secure fit in order to get heart

754
00:45:44,885 --> 00:45:48,525
Speaker 5:  rate. That's just gonna make the seal better regardless. And then on top

755
00:45:48,525 --> 00:45:52,285
Speaker 5:  of that, there's five sizes of tips. Now mine were

756
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:56,245
Speaker 5:  medium, so it was just fine straight out of the case. But you know,

757
00:45:56,685 --> 00:45:57,965
Speaker 5:  I was, I was quite impressed.

758
00:45:58,435 --> 00:46:01,365
Speaker 1:  It's actually the, the set of hardware things they did here

759
00:46:02,225 --> 00:46:05,085
Speaker 1:  is pretty impressive, right? So in addition, right, there's the, there's

760
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:08,645
Speaker 1:  the heart rate sensor. It's I think a slightly

761
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:12,645
Speaker 1:  lighter whole thing when you include the, the headphones

762
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:16,285
Speaker 1:  and the case, the whole package is slightly lighter. It's IP

763
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:19,885
Speaker 1:  57 dust, sweat resistance, which is like, to be clear,

764
00:46:20,065 --> 00:46:23,725
Speaker 1:  is not the same as my headphones are waterproof. Like, like please dear,

765
00:46:23,735 --> 00:46:26,885
Speaker 1:  sweet Jesus, no, do not think your headphones are waterproof, but this is

766
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:30,245
Speaker 1:  better. And this is the first time Apple has given these things a real proper,

767
00:46:30,475 --> 00:46:34,445
Speaker 1:  they will withstand this stuff rating. Yes. That,

768
00:46:34,445 --> 00:46:37,685
Speaker 1:  that I feel comfortable and good with. So that's exciting. Better battery

769
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:41,485
Speaker 1:  life, more ear tips, like you said, the, the heart rate

770
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:45,125
Speaker 1:  sensor, it'll do live translation stuff like this. This is a lot of hardware

771
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:49,045
Speaker 1:  stuff to do in headphones. This is not just like we improved

772
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:52,845
Speaker 1:  the software and it'll connect more cleanly to your Mac so that it'll ring

773
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:55,725
Speaker 1:  every time you get a phone call on all of your computers. Now this is like

774
00:46:55,835 --> 00:46:59,565
Speaker 1:  real genuine hardware stuff inside of these, which is awesome.

775
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:03,685
Speaker 5:  It's very substantial. And you know, I think like, like I was mentioning

776
00:47:03,685 --> 00:47:05,525
Speaker 5:  with the fit kind of playing into the

777
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:10,885
Speaker 5:  A NC, some of it is also just kind of, I think there's

778
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:14,245
Speaker 5:  the most thesis in this device com across all of the ones that were

779
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:20,445
Speaker 5:  released today. Because on the one hand, you know, we are slowly like

780
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:24,365
Speaker 5:  giving baby baby sprinkles of AI in there with the translation.

781
00:47:24,905 --> 00:47:28,845
Speaker 5:  And that is a thing that we've been seeing across the board from other companies.

782
00:47:28,865 --> 00:47:32,685
Speaker 5:  But it's most natural. I think it's one thing to translate a phone call

783
00:47:32,785 --> 00:47:35,725
Speaker 5:  on, on a phone and yay Gemini, yay all of the

784
00:47:36,765 --> 00:47:39,725
Speaker 5:  whatever live translations for phone calls. But it's very natural to have

785
00:47:39,725 --> 00:47:42,925
Speaker 5:  it in your AirPods when you're going about

786
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:47,725
Speaker 5:  it. Kind of just makes sense to have it built into the actual

787
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:50,965
Speaker 5:  buds themselves. Totally. And then just

788
00:47:51,805 --> 00:47:55,005
Speaker 5:  I, as someone who works out, was kind of like, oh my god,

789
00:47:55,745 --> 00:47:59,525
Speaker 5:  you're allowing standalone workouts with the AirPods

790
00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:03,525
Speaker 5:  alone. Hmm. You don't need an Apple watch anymore. You can just do 50

791
00:48:03,775 --> 00:48:07,245
Speaker 5:  types of workouts. And it's quite extensive. I did get a demo of this,

792
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:12,845
Speaker 5:  of the heart rate sensor and how the standalone workout

793
00:48:12,845 --> 00:48:16,645
Speaker 5:  session is gonna go. And I was like, oh, this is huge

794
00:48:16,665 --> 00:48:20,445
Speaker 5:  for people with wrist tattoos. Because I consistently hear from people

795
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:24,325
Speaker 5:  who are like, I don't wanna wear a chest strap, I don't wanna, my

796
00:48:24,325 --> 00:48:28,005
Speaker 5:  Apple Watch doesn't really do heart rate. Well 'cause I have a whole

797
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,965
Speaker 5:  sleeve, there's just a tattoo there. Well, you don't need to worry about

798
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:34,925
Speaker 5:  it anymore. You can just have it in your ears and use that

799
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:38,285
Speaker 5:  to, to track. Or, you know, I have friends who do boxing, they can't wear

800
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:41,525
Speaker 5:  a watch while they box, right? But they want the heart rate stuff. So you

801
00:48:41,525 --> 00:48:44,805
Speaker 5:  could just do it that way. It's kind of having

802
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:49,265
Speaker 5:  a new modality that's

803
00:48:49,265 --> 00:48:53,185
Speaker 5:  open to you for heart rate tracking and you know, it's actually better

804
00:48:53,685 --> 00:48:57,465
Speaker 5:  in my opinion, than the Powerbeats Pro two, which

805
00:48:57,795 --> 00:49:00,545
Speaker 5:  introduced this. And so, you know, there was kind of a sense that the heart

806
00:49:00,545 --> 00:49:03,665
Speaker 5:  rate tracking was coming, but it's better because

807
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:08,465
Speaker 5:  it's gonna work in tandem with your Apple Watch. So you can have

808
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:13,265
Speaker 5:  a multiple streams of data with the Powerbeats Pro two, it's always gonna

809
00:49:13,315 --> 00:49:17,185
Speaker 5:  defer to your Apple Watch. This will go, hmm, so you have a stream of heart

810
00:49:17,185 --> 00:49:21,025
Speaker 5:  rate data from your earbuds. Oh, you have a heart stream

811
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:24,825
Speaker 5:  of heart rate data from your wrist, which one is more accurate right now?

812
00:49:24,825 --> 00:49:28,705
Speaker 5:  Which one is giving you the better signal? And it'll switch between

813
00:49:28,705 --> 00:49:28,945
Speaker 5:  those,

814
00:49:29,195 --> 00:49:33,065
Speaker 1:  Which is like an incredibly aply way of thinking about things,

815
00:49:33,065 --> 00:49:35,145
Speaker 1:  right? Yeah. Like if you wanna describe the thing that Apple tends to be

816
00:49:35,145 --> 00:49:38,625
Speaker 1:  better at than anybody else, it is precisely that thing. And half of that

817
00:49:38,825 --> 00:49:42,305
Speaker 1:  thing is making you buy more devices that do largely redundant things, but

818
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:45,745
Speaker 1:  the other half is like actually making the sum greater or actually making

819
00:49:45,805 --> 00:49:49,345
Speaker 1:  the whole greater than the sum of its parts. And that is yeah. Meaningful.

820
00:49:49,365 --> 00:49:52,985
Speaker 1:  And I think that's very cool. So I think to me, yeah, the, the AirPods Pro

821
00:49:52,985 --> 00:49:56,265
Speaker 1:  three are like, if, if you're in the market for AirPods, these sound like

822
00:49:56,265 --> 00:49:59,305
Speaker 1:  they're gonna kick ass. I think I, it's probably overkill if you're not

823
00:50:00,005 --> 00:50:03,945
Speaker 1:  really like an exercise person, but to me, honestly for the IP 57

824
00:50:04,075 --> 00:50:07,745
Speaker 1:  alone, it, as someone who has had weather

825
00:50:08,245 --> 00:50:11,985
Speaker 1:  and laundry ruin multiple pairs of AirPods over the years, like that

826
00:50:11,995 --> 00:50:14,225
Speaker 1:  alone is a huge upgrade for me.

827
00:50:14,785 --> 00:50:17,705
Speaker 5:  I mean, that's a huge thing for me too, as someone who has been caught in

828
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:20,905
Speaker 5:  downpours while running. So it's, I've, I've wrecked

829
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:25,145
Speaker 5:  earbuds that way. So it is a pretty, it's a pretty,

830
00:50:26,185 --> 00:50:30,145
Speaker 5:  I don't know, I think it's surprisingly like the sleeper hit, in my opinion

831
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:34,465
Speaker 5:  as far as utility goes, as far as it like, should I upgrade? I,

832
00:50:34,945 --> 00:50:38,025
Speaker 5:  I mean of course I'm gonna test 'em and I'm gonna live with them and tell

833
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:41,705
Speaker 5:  you everything that is great and not great about it. But if you're a day

834
00:50:41,725 --> 00:50:45,505
Speaker 5:  one, I don't give a crap what reviewers think. This is the

835
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:48,185
Speaker 5:  thing that I think makes most sense on paper to upgrade to.

836
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:51,425
Speaker 1:  Totally. So, okay, let's talk about the watches, which I would argue are

837
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:55,385
Speaker 1:  substantially less straightforward. And I,

838
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:59,265
Speaker 1:  what I realized to me is I actually think the watches are most interesting,

839
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:02,745
Speaker 1:  like directly in order from cheapest to most expensive. Yes. Which is not

840
00:51:02,805 --> 00:51:06,025
Speaker 1:  how I have felt about the Apple Watch before. Ordinarily I would've said

841
00:51:06,055 --> 00:51:09,265
Speaker 1:  like the, the, the middle one, the, the sort of

842
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:13,345
Speaker 1:  vanilla Apple watch is the one, the se is the one if

843
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:17,145
Speaker 1:  and only if you just can't afford it. Like understand. But like

844
00:51:17,525 --> 00:51:19,985
Speaker 1:  if you can, if there's any way at all to get the regular watch, get the watch,

845
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:23,825
Speaker 1:  and then the ultra is if you're like a lunatic in several ways. But

846
00:51:24,705 --> 00:51:27,865
Speaker 1:  I don't feel that way anymore. Now I, the, the, I wanna start with the watch

847
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:31,985
Speaker 1:  se three, which I think might now be the

848
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:35,905
Speaker 1:  correct Apple watch for most people. Lemme just run you through

849
00:51:35,905 --> 00:51:38,745
Speaker 1:  some of the specs here that I think are like big giant, huge upgrades,

850
00:51:39,085 --> 00:51:43,065
Speaker 1:  $249, lovely price, faster processor, longer battery life,

851
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:46,745
Speaker 1:  stronger glass. It has an always on display, which is one of the like main

852
00:51:46,745 --> 00:51:49,385
Speaker 1:  things a watch should do is tell you the time, all the time.

853
00:51:50,885 --> 00:51:54,625
Speaker 1:  It has 5G, it has better battery, not great battery, but it has better battery.

854
00:51:54,885 --> 00:51:58,465
Speaker 1:  It has more of the gesture stuff that the other watches have had. It's missing

855
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:02,105
Speaker 1:  some of the like really high end fitness health stuff.

856
00:52:02,445 --> 00:52:06,105
Speaker 1:  But if you can do without that and what you want is just like a, a smartwatch

857
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:10,185
Speaker 1:  for other smartwatch things. This feels like a, the,

858
00:52:10,285 --> 00:52:12,705
Speaker 1:  the biggest upgrade by a mile in this line.

859
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:17,385
Speaker 5:  100%. I was sitting there going like, am I most excited about the

860
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:21,625
Speaker 5:  SE three? Right. That was not on my bingo card. And to be quite

861
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:25,025
Speaker 5:  honest, I am most excited about the SE three because it is the most

862
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:29,145
Speaker 5:  substantial of the updates. And it's a confusing move

863
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:33,025
Speaker 5:  in some respects because now the gap between the SE

864
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:34,145
Speaker 5:  and the series,

865
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:39,465
Speaker 5:  it's razor thin. Yes. It's basically health. Health is the big

866
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:42,465
Speaker 5:  differentiator between the two. I I, I would say health and battery life,

867
00:52:43,005 --> 00:52:46,385
Speaker 5:  but one of the things that's not coming to the SE three is the high blood

868
00:52:46,585 --> 00:52:50,185
Speaker 5:  pressure feature that's currently going through FDA clearance.

869
00:52:51,065 --> 00:52:54,665
Speaker 5:  I think they're, I think they're pretty confident that they will get that

870
00:52:54,665 --> 00:52:56,025
Speaker 5:  clearance soon. But yeah,

871
00:52:56,025 --> 00:52:58,545
Speaker 1:  There was a footnote I think that said by the end of this month, they expect

872
00:52:58,545 --> 00:52:59,945
Speaker 1:  the hypertension stuff to be FDA

873
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:01,465
Speaker 5:  A approved. So like, yeah, so, you know, they, who knows,

874
00:53:01,465 --> 00:53:02,545
Speaker 1:  But that's that.

875
00:53:02,655 --> 00:53:06,585
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Who knows? But they, they seem pretty confident. And if we

876
00:53:06,585 --> 00:53:10,105
Speaker 5:  look at Apple's track history, it's, or track record

877
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:12,665
Speaker 5:  is a lot better than Withings. It's

878
00:53:12,665 --> 00:53:12,745
Speaker 1:  Real,

879
00:53:14,295 --> 00:53:18,225
Speaker 5:  It's a lot better than that one. So, you know, it's kind of one of

880
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:21,985
Speaker 5:  those things where I sat there And I was like, okay, you know,

881
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,370
Speaker 5:  one, one of the things that the SE three is getting is also a speaker.

882
00:53:26,075 --> 00:53:29,765
Speaker 5:  That was a thing that was get kept to the flagship last year.

883
00:53:31,505 --> 00:53:35,205
Speaker 5:  It truly is, what are you missing? You're missing blood oxygen. Yep.

884
00:53:35,205 --> 00:53:37,445
Speaker 5:  You're missing EKGs, you're missing

885
00:53:39,075 --> 00:53:42,845
Speaker 5:  that high, high blood pressure thing, but you're getting sleep apnea. You're

886
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:46,725
Speaker 5:  getting the sleep score. And, and the reason why you're not getting

887
00:53:46,825 --> 00:53:50,045
Speaker 5:  the high blood pressure thing is because it does not have the most up-to-date

888
00:53:50,555 --> 00:53:53,725
Speaker 5:  optical heart rate sensor. Which, you know, it's, it's good enough.

889
00:53:54,705 --> 00:53:57,605
Speaker 5:  You don't get the 24 hour battery life, which we have to talk about

890
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:02,365
Speaker 5:  the significance of it being 24 for the series 11, but

891
00:54:03,505 --> 00:54:07,415
Speaker 5:  it is getting fast charging for the first time. And I have

892
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:11,495
Speaker 5:  talked to dozens, bazillions, I, I, many,

893
00:54:11,525 --> 00:54:14,815
Speaker 5:  many Apple Watch users, I have talked to them and they either fall into the

894
00:54:15,015 --> 00:54:18,495
Speaker 5:  category of like, well, it's no garment, it's not lasting forever.

895
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:22,735
Speaker 5:  Or the very like, well you just charge it when you shower. What's the big

896
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:26,495
Speaker 5:  deal, yo? And you know, 15 minutes on the charger is

897
00:54:26,615 --> 00:54:30,375
Speaker 5:  supposedly gonna get you eight hours-ish of battery life. So

898
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,105
Speaker 1:  I'm be asking. So as long as you shower every eight hours, you should be

899
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:34,865
Speaker 1:  fine. You

900
00:54:34,865 --> 00:54:36,185
Speaker 5:  Should be fine. This is, so

901
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:38,825
Speaker 1:  I, I actually, let's talk about battery life and, and this, this is a good

902
00:54:38,825 --> 00:54:42,625
Speaker 1:  segue into the series 11 because I, I think that

903
00:54:42,685 --> 00:54:46,625
Speaker 1:  the single most important spec of the Apple watch right now

904
00:54:47,205 --> 00:54:50,865
Speaker 1:  is battery life. I, in terms of like a, your ongoing

905
00:54:50,865 --> 00:54:54,745
Speaker 1:  enjoyment of the product B the set of things that you can do with it, especially

906
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:58,625
Speaker 1:  I think I'm more and more converted to cellular

907
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:01,705
Speaker 1:  apple watch all the time. I don't own a cellular watch right now, but I am,

908
00:55:01,745 --> 00:55:05,105
Speaker 1:  I am confident the next one I buy will be a cellular one because it just,

909
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:08,985
Speaker 1:  there's just a set of things that suddenly become possible, But that also

910
00:55:09,725 --> 00:55:13,305
Speaker 1:  is going to destroy battery life. So we're at this place now where like the

911
00:55:13,545 --> 00:55:16,865
Speaker 1:  E three says 18 hours of battery and that just isn't enough. Because what

912
00:55:17,185 --> 00:55:20,905
Speaker 1:  that means is it is going to die before I can charge it. It just, it just

913
00:55:20,905 --> 00:55:21,105
Speaker 1:  does.

914
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:25,385
Speaker 5:  Here's the thing. Apple always says 18, but they're the opposite of Samsung

915
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:29,435
Speaker 5:  where I have like yelled at Samsung many years in

916
00:55:29,435 --> 00:55:33,155
Speaker 5:  a row by them overestimating or overpromising on the battery life of their

917
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:36,915
Speaker 5:  watches and them fall. I admit I'm a power user, but

918
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:41,435
Speaker 5:  them falling short of the promises and

919
00:55:41,535 --> 00:55:45,275
Speaker 5:  me being like, yo, that's, that's dumb. And Apple

920
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:48,755
Speaker 5:  has always under promised and over-delivered with battery life. That is true.

921
00:55:48,935 --> 00:55:52,675
Speaker 5:  It depends year to year. So it's not always gonna be better

922
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:56,675
Speaker 5:  or whatever, depending on what features they're offering and what's running

923
00:55:56,695 --> 00:56:00,595
Speaker 5:  in the background, what the software is. But I

924
00:56:00,595 --> 00:56:04,475
Speaker 5:  have routinely gotten better than 18 hours of battery life for many,

925
00:56:04,475 --> 00:56:08,115
Speaker 5:  many years now to the point where I'm like, they say 18. But that is such

926
00:56:08,155 --> 00:56:09,635
Speaker 5:  a conservative estimate. I think

927
00:56:09,635 --> 00:56:12,235
Speaker 1:  That's true. Now that I think about it. I, And I do think to your point,

928
00:56:12,315 --> 00:56:16,155
Speaker 1:  I think, I think the fast charging thing is probably the bigger deal. 'cause

929
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:20,035
Speaker 1:  if it, if it was true that I could charge zero to a

930
00:56:20,035 --> 00:56:23,285
Speaker 1:  hundred or close to it in the time that it takes me to like shower and get

931
00:56:23,285 --> 00:56:27,125
Speaker 1:  ready in the morning, charging stops being a problem. Like now I have infinite

932
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:30,485
Speaker 1:  battery life, right? Like yeah, I, I take it off when I take my clothes off

933
00:56:30,485 --> 00:56:34,085
Speaker 1:  And I put it on when I put my clothes on and that is the end. We've done

934
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:34,165
Speaker 1:  it.

935
00:56:34,385 --> 00:56:37,245
Speaker 5:  And you should, you should be airing out your wrist. Right? I'm very, very

936
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:40,685
Speaker 5:  passionate about airing out your wrist because I've, I, again, I'm a crazy

937
00:56:40,685 --> 00:56:41,965
Speaker 5:  wearable lady, so I

938
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,845
Speaker 1:  Was gonna say this feels like a you problem to, to some extent, but

939
00:56:45,105 --> 00:56:48,765
Speaker 5:  To some extent. But you really do need to air out your wrists because the

940
00:56:48,765 --> 00:56:50,645
Speaker 5:  skin gets weird if you don't.

941
00:56:50,985 --> 00:56:53,845
Speaker 1:  My Apple watch, which is currently dead, I'm taking off right now just to

942
00:56:53,845 --> 00:56:55,045
Speaker 1:  air out my wrists while we're doing this.

943
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:59,205
Speaker 5:  Thank you. Your skin will thank you for that. But to that

944
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:03,005
Speaker 5:  point, you know, for them this is 10 years of

945
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:06,765
Speaker 5:  them never budging beyond the 18 hour estimate. Even though I have

946
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:10,645
Speaker 5:  routinely gotten more than 18 hours for several years, especially

947
00:57:10,645 --> 00:57:14,525
Speaker 5:  after they introduced the low, the improved low ba low battery power mode.

948
00:57:15,705 --> 00:57:19,565
Speaker 5:  So for them to say it's 24, I'm sitting here just like, are we

949
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:23,485
Speaker 5:  getting 24 or are we getting 36? Right.

950
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:27,285
Speaker 5:  You know, it of course it always depends on your usage. It depends on how

951
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:30,965
Speaker 5:  much extra you can get out of a low power battery mode.

952
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:35,065
Speaker 5:  But I'm saying I think them

953
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:39,305
Speaker 5:  moving from 18 to 24, they do not do that unless

954
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:43,065
Speaker 5:  they're very confident and they are very conservative.

955
00:57:43,645 --> 00:57:47,345
Speaker 5:  So for them to say 24 to me as

956
00:57:47,365 --> 00:57:51,315
Speaker 5:  having tested everything since the, I don't, I don't even

957
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:55,435
Speaker 5:  remember, but it's like a small number like the Apple Watch series two,

958
00:57:56,095 --> 00:57:59,995
Speaker 5:  at least having lived with every iteration of the Apple watch since then,

959
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:03,555
Speaker 5:  that is, that is big to me. Particularly me. I was just like

960
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:07,275
Speaker 6:  24 hours, oh my God,

961
00:58:07,505 --> 00:58:10,955
Speaker 6:  they've moved the number up. Oh my god, that never happens.

962
00:58:11,495 --> 00:58:15,155
Speaker 5:  So, you know, I was sitting there just like exclamation point, exclamation

963
00:58:15,155 --> 00:58:18,195
Speaker 5:  point, exclamation point that that's actually a big thing and it's the number

964
00:58:18,215 --> 00:58:21,435
Speaker 5:  one thing that readers are, are in my comments about just being like,

965
00:58:22,535 --> 00:58:26,095
Speaker 5:  moderate life is my number one thing and it plays into sleep tracking

966
00:58:26,735 --> 00:58:30,335
Speaker 5:  because you cannot have 18 hours and, and sleep track

967
00:58:30,335 --> 00:58:34,215
Speaker 5:  effectively. And it, sleep tracking is something that people really want.

968
00:58:35,155 --> 00:58:39,015
Speaker 5:  You know, apple has always been a little bit behind on sleep tracking compared

969
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,975
Speaker 5:  to the market because of the battery life issue. So for them to really

970
00:58:43,235 --> 00:58:47,095
Speaker 5:  do that and on top of that go, we have a sleep score for you. Now

971
00:58:47,845 --> 00:58:48,695
Speaker 5:  that is sort of,

972
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:54,595
Speaker 5:  I gotta say that, that those are just like how they air pods

973
00:58:55,015 --> 00:58:58,475
Speaker 5:  and the heart rate sensor, you know, those things work synergistically,

974
00:58:58,895 --> 00:59:02,755
Speaker 5:  having long battery life having a sleep score. These are things that enable

975
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:03,235
Speaker 5:  each other.

976
00:59:03,505 --> 00:59:07,315
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And you, you continue to convince me that sleep tracking is

977
00:59:07,395 --> 00:59:10,955
Speaker 1:  a huge thing because I think, and this, this gets us to the ultra a little

978
00:59:10,955 --> 00:59:14,735
Speaker 1:  bit. Like I, one of the things that puts all of these devices

979
00:59:14,735 --> 00:59:18,175
Speaker 1:  that we're talking about here together is that Apple

980
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,460
Speaker 1:  is really like pretty aggressively pivoting into being a

981
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,245
Speaker 1:  health tech company in a way that I am perpetually surprised by like

982
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:30,125
Speaker 1:  all of the sort of everyday normal person features

983
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:33,605
Speaker 1:  stay the same year to year and then they give you more health stuff. Like

984
00:59:33,605 --> 00:59:37,165
Speaker 1:  that's what's happening on these devices. And it, it's fascinating And I,

985
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:41,085
Speaker 1:  I continue to think like, I, I think I believed Tim Cook when he says

986
00:59:41,085 --> 00:59:43,445
Speaker 1:  it is like a thing he cares about as a person.

987
00:59:45,355 --> 00:59:47,755
Speaker 1:  I have a lot of thoughts about what Tim Cook cares about as a person right

988
00:59:47,755 --> 00:59:51,675
Speaker 1:  now, but we'll come back to those another time. But I think I,

989
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:54,355
Speaker 1:  it is fascinating that that is a thing that Apple has identified as like

990
00:59:54,565 --> 00:59:58,475
Speaker 1:  meaningful to its business also. And I think to your

991
00:59:58,475 --> 01:00:02,395
Speaker 1:  point, I do think sleep track and especially the sleep score thing

992
01:00:03,105 --> 01:00:06,755
Speaker 1:  strikes me as a, a, a huge opportunity there to like

993
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,835
Speaker 1:  get right and do in a like big mainstream way.

994
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:13,875
Speaker 5:  Listen, I come from a family of doctors and one of the things that

995
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:17,715
Speaker 5:  they always told me is that the number one possession you have, the thing

996
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:21,415
Speaker 5:  that will influence your life more is your health. If you have bad

997
01:00:21,415 --> 01:00:22,895
Speaker 1:  Health, that's such a parent thing to say, I'd

998
01:00:22,895 --> 01:00:25,695
Speaker 5:  Love this for you. It's, but also it's, it's a parent thing to say, but this

999
01:00:25,695 --> 01:00:29,655
Speaker 5:  was mostly my grandpa who was like a big famous doctor in this one city in

1000
01:00:29,655 --> 01:00:33,575
Speaker 5:  Korea. And he was just like, if you do not have your health, you do not have

1001
01:00:33,655 --> 01:00:37,535
Speaker 5:  a good life. And I was very dramatic. That's like a very, you

1002
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:41,055
Speaker 5:  have to think about it in a very old dramatic

1003
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:45,015
Speaker 5:  Korean grandpa way where he's like, Victoria, if you do not have your health,

1004
01:00:45,235 --> 01:00:49,215
Speaker 5:  you do not have life. So, but he's true, he's

1005
01:00:49,215 --> 01:00:53,175
Speaker 5:  completely correct in the sense that this is the thing that Gale Apple

1006
01:00:53,265 --> 01:00:57,215
Speaker 5:  watch to be a thing. 'cause you know, if we,

1007
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,375
Speaker 5:  we go back in Apple watch history, they thought it was gonna be fashion and

1008
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:04,575
Speaker 5:  LLOL. Yeah. I'm too poor to ever have a Hermes Apple

1009
01:01:04,575 --> 01:01:06,775
Speaker 5:  watch even though they're very pretty, they're very nice but

1010
01:01:06,775 --> 01:01:08,815
Speaker 1:  Still exists. And it still exists. Which is a thing, thing I didn't realize

1011
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:12,095
Speaker 1:  still exist until literally today when they said Hermes on stage. Yeah. Still.

1012
01:01:12,165 --> 01:01:12,455
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1013
01:01:12,915 --> 01:01:16,495
Speaker 5:  But you know, it didn't really kick off until EKGs came out and then everyone's

1014
01:01:16,495 --> 01:01:19,415
Speaker 5:  like, oh my God, this is gonna save your grandma's life and now what do they

1015
01:01:19,415 --> 01:01:22,855
Speaker 5:  do every single year? And I think I said it in the live blog And I was like,

1016
01:01:23,295 --> 01:01:27,175
Speaker 5:  Q the annual, the Apple watch will save your life real. And they, and it's,

1017
01:01:27,175 --> 01:01:30,495
Speaker 5:  and it's very compelling because you have real life people and they find

1018
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:34,175
Speaker 5:  different ones every year. It's not the same person every year. Different

1019
01:01:34,175 --> 01:01:38,095
Speaker 5:  people who are like, this thing saved my life because it pointed out a thing.

1020
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:42,005
Speaker 5:  And you know, I think that's, we watch it and we go like, well

1021
01:01:42,155 --> 01:01:45,085
Speaker 5:  yeah, okay, you're giving me health anxiety. But at the same time it's a

1022
01:01:45,085 --> 01:01:48,925
Speaker 5:  very compelling marketing proposition. And the thing that

1023
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:53,085
Speaker 5:  I get asked a lot by my friends, family, people I know is what do I

1024
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:56,845
Speaker 5:  buy my mom or my dad? They recently had a health crisis

1025
01:01:57,225 --> 01:02:01,045
Speaker 5:  and so what do I, what do I do? And you know, they, what they are

1026
01:02:01,045 --> 01:02:04,805
Speaker 5:  doing is they're basically positioning the SE three as kind of like the

1027
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:08,485
Speaker 5:  core smartwatch experience. It's something that gives you a taste

1028
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:12,445
Speaker 5:  and it's very expansive, but we're gonna get, keep the

1029
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:15,965
Speaker 5:  health to the series. So the series is now

1030
01:02:16,155 --> 01:02:19,685
Speaker 5:  your overall health watch. And then, you know, the ultra three is for as

1031
01:02:19,685 --> 01:02:22,675
Speaker 5:  lunatics out here doing fitness stuff

1032
01:02:23,195 --> 01:02:26,715
Speaker 5:  basically. So, you know, if you think about it from that lens, the updates

1033
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:30,355
Speaker 5:  make sense. I kind of wish they made it clearer in their

1034
01:02:30,355 --> 01:02:33,675
Speaker 5:  messaging. 'cause you kind of have to just like sit there and turn into the,

1035
01:02:33,675 --> 01:02:37,475
Speaker 5:  the meme of the, the, the lady doing the, the math floating around her

1036
01:02:37,535 --> 01:02:40,435
Speaker 5:  and just going like, what, what is happening here with these updates?

1037
01:02:41,815 --> 01:02:45,755
Speaker 5:  But I think that's the key D differentiator going forward between

1038
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:49,755
Speaker 5:  the series and the se is like, how much do you care about your health?

1039
01:02:49,925 --> 01:02:53,875
Speaker 5:  Right? How, how much do you, like nobody wants to

1040
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:57,555
Speaker 5:  die, right? Like we all want health insurance because we want to live and

1041
01:02:57,555 --> 01:03:00,955
Speaker 5:  we want to live well and we want to live healthy. So I don't think Tim Cook

1042
01:03:00,975 --> 01:03:04,675
Speaker 5:  is wrong even though, you know, SW Tim Cook. So he obviously cares

1043
01:03:04,685 --> 01:03:06,555
Speaker 5:  about all of that. But

1044
01:03:08,315 --> 01:03:12,235
Speaker 5:  I genuinely think that people will do anything to live a healthy life

1045
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:15,515
Speaker 5:  because it means they get to live longer. It means they get to spend more

1046
01:03:15,515 --> 01:03:19,235
Speaker 5:  time with the people they love. So tapping into that and saying this is an

1047
01:03:19,235 --> 01:03:22,555
Speaker 5:  essential device for you to live a long how Happy Life

1048
01:03:23,945 --> 01:03:26,435
Speaker 5:  Kain kaching baby, that's monetization for

1049
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:30,355
Speaker 1:  You. It's true, it is, it is tough to argue with the theory there, but I

1050
01:03:30,355 --> 01:03:32,915
Speaker 1:  like that differentiation of like, there's the, there's the smart watch,

1051
01:03:32,915 --> 01:03:36,715
Speaker 1:  which is the, the SE three. There is the Health watch I guess,

1052
01:03:36,715 --> 01:03:39,835
Speaker 1:  which is the, the series 11. And then there's the Lunatic watch, which is

1053
01:03:39,835 --> 01:03:42,555
Speaker 1:  the, the ultra three. Yes. And I mean lunatic as a compliment to be clear.

1054
01:03:42,915 --> 01:03:46,035
Speaker 1:  Every ev all of you lunatics who are hearing this being like, I'm normal

1055
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:48,875
Speaker 1:  And I wear like, please know that I hear you And I love you.

1056
01:03:50,265 --> 01:03:54,235
Speaker 1:  Nothing about the ultra three seemed super duper exciting to me.

1057
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:58,315
Speaker 1:  It's got like a little bigger screen. The, the ed's a little better. Little

1058
01:03:58,315 --> 01:04:01,115
Speaker 1:  longer battery life, like the, the things you would like hope would get a

1059
01:04:01,115 --> 01:04:03,995
Speaker 1:  little better. Rev to rev, but nothing that feels like it's gonna sort of

1060
01:04:03,995 --> 01:04:05,755
Speaker 1:  meaningfully change your experience with this watch.

1061
01:04:06,235 --> 01:04:09,635
Speaker 5:  I think that is a hundred percent true for non lunatics

1062
01:04:10,275 --> 01:04:13,355
Speaker 5:  because Okay, you know, you know they speak the largest,

1063
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:14,395
Speaker 1:  I speak the non lunatics. Yeah,

1064
01:04:14,575 --> 01:04:18,435
Speaker 5:  The largest display ever. Well I held the ultra two and the

1065
01:04:18,435 --> 01:04:22,235
Speaker 5:  three side by side And I think VERGE cast listeners know because I've been

1066
01:04:22,235 --> 01:04:25,795
Speaker 5:  screaming this all summer, I have garbage eyeballs. My, my eyes are not great.

1067
01:04:26,975 --> 01:04:30,595
Speaker 5:  So take that with a grain of salt knowing that my

1068
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:34,475
Speaker 5:  eyeballs not the best eyeballs and and on earth held them side by

1069
01:04:34,475 --> 01:04:38,435
Speaker 5:  side. And I went I guess the bezels a little thinner.

1070
01:04:39,115 --> 01:04:40,955
Speaker 5:  I guess it's slightly. Yeah, sure.

1071
01:04:41,235 --> 01:04:42,755
Speaker 1:  I mean this is where we're at now. Yeah. This

1072
01:04:42,755 --> 01:04:46,195
Speaker 5:  Is where we're at. Yeah. But for the lunatics out there, the thing is

1073
01:04:46,435 --> 01:04:49,835
Speaker 5:  SOS satellite communication Sure. Fair. That's gonna be the thing. Yeah.

1074
01:04:49,835 --> 01:04:53,755
Speaker 5:  Because if you're a through hiker, if you're someone who has a Garmin in

1075
01:04:53,755 --> 01:04:57,075
Speaker 5:  reach or you wanna be able to, I don't know,

1076
01:04:57,455 --> 01:05:01,075
Speaker 5:  you've fallen down a ravine and your phone went flying and

1077
01:05:01,075 --> 01:05:04,675
Speaker 5:  you're just like, ah, crap, a moola, I don't wanna die

1078
01:05:04,855 --> 01:05:08,795
Speaker 5:  And I really save me someone. Well now you have

1079
01:05:09,055 --> 01:05:11,955
Speaker 5:  OS satellite, SOS and it includes texting,

1080
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,795
Speaker 5:  includes location SA sharing and it also includes just

1081
01:05:16,915 --> 01:05:20,285
Speaker 5:  sending messages in areas where you have absolutely

1082
01:05:20,825 --> 01:05:22,085
Speaker 5:  no signal whatsoever.

1083
01:05:23,825 --> 01:05:26,845
Speaker 5:  For me, my initial thing was like, well they had that on The iPhone,

1084
01:05:27,605 --> 01:05:31,545
Speaker 5:  what's the benefit of having that on a watch? And so then I

1085
01:05:31,545 --> 01:05:34,665
Speaker 5:  was thinking of the scenario where I fell off a cliff And I'm like, oh God,

1086
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:37,585
Speaker 5:  there goes my phone. I guess it's still on me

1087
01:05:38,525 --> 01:05:42,425
Speaker 5:  za Sure. But also, you know, one, one of the things I was

1088
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:46,265
Speaker 5:  thinking about was like, well on the ultra, the battery life lasts a pretty

1089
01:05:46,415 --> 01:05:50,265
Speaker 5:  good dang long time. So you have options I

1090
01:05:50,265 --> 01:05:53,385
Speaker 5:  guess. Yeah. But you know, it, it is an important thing. It's the heart

1091
01:05:53,385 --> 01:05:56,585
Speaker 1:  Rate thing all over again, right? Like it's, it's, it's a case where there

1092
01:05:56,585 --> 01:06:00,065
Speaker 1:  just is no downside to having more versions of the feature

1093
01:06:00,845 --> 01:06:01,345
Speaker 1:  at your

1094
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:05,905
Speaker 5:  Disposal. Yeah. And you know, a lot of through hikers, like our very

1095
01:06:05,905 --> 01:06:09,065
Speaker 5:  own good Mitchell Clark, may he hike in

1096
01:06:09,435 --> 01:06:13,385
Speaker 5:  perpetuity, but when he went on his absolutely lunatic

1097
01:06:14,185 --> 01:06:18,105
Speaker 5:  quest to go to the Pacific Crest Trail, I,

1098
01:06:18,295 --> 01:06:21,585
Speaker 5:  dude, I don't know how you did that Livia Mitchell, but couldn't be me.

1099
01:06:22,205 --> 01:06:23,705
Speaker 1:  That's lunatic stuff. It really

1100
01:06:23,705 --> 01:06:26,905
Speaker 5:  Is. That's lunatic. Yeah. It like, this is who that appeals to, right? Because

1101
01:06:26,905 --> 01:06:29,905
Speaker 5:  they, those people have Garmin and reaches, they have subscriptions for the

1102
01:06:29,905 --> 01:06:33,745
Speaker 5:  Garmin and reach, and that's basically there to go like, oh, I'm in

1103
01:06:34,025 --> 01:06:37,585
Speaker 5:  t Ask in Maryland where my, my spouse is in-laws are from, and there's only

1104
01:06:37,645 --> 01:06:41,585
Speaker 5:  one tree where if you stand a certain way you get a bar of signal.

1105
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:46,425
Speaker 5:  You know, like for people who are in those areas who spend a lot of time

1106
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:49,865
Speaker 5:  in those areas who maybe don't wanna have their phone on them, or even their

1107
01:06:49,865 --> 01:06:53,425
Speaker 5:  phone isn't really doing it for them, you know, you just have another

1108
01:06:53,525 --> 01:06:56,225
Speaker 5:  option. I think it's a good thing

1109
01:06:57,445 --> 01:07:01,025
Speaker 5:  in terms of if you're paranoid about that or if you just wanna check in on,

1110
01:07:01,045 --> 01:07:04,745
Speaker 5:  on these hiking trips or whatnot. But the other thing

1111
01:07:05,045 --> 01:07:08,875
Speaker 5:  is, you know, it's a watch that people

1112
01:07:08,895 --> 01:07:12,475
Speaker 5:  who love the ultras, love the ultras. When we were in the,

1113
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:16,595
Speaker 5:  the arena, you know, when the ultra came out, I heard people

1114
01:07:16,595 --> 01:07:20,075
Speaker 5:  around me go, yes. Yeah. And I was, oh yeah, what is this? What is this

1115
01:07:20,475 --> 01:07:21,435
Speaker 5:  visceral love for the,

1116
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:22,195
Speaker 1:  It does have its

1117
01:07:22,195 --> 01:07:24,915
Speaker 5:  People, the ultra for sure. Like it has its people. And for those people

1118
01:07:25,115 --> 01:07:28,995
Speaker 5:  I think that's who the satellite s os is for. And you don't pay a

1119
01:07:29,155 --> 01:07:32,635
Speaker 5:  subscription for two years with that. Yeah. And you know, that's

1120
01:07:33,255 --> 01:07:37,195
Speaker 5:  you, I mean, one should hope if one is buying a $800

1121
01:07:37,245 --> 01:07:41,235
Speaker 5:  watch for the satellite SOS and trying to

1122
01:07:41,235 --> 01:07:44,995
Speaker 5:  get rid of some of the other equipment and maybe like streamlining it into

1123
01:07:45,225 --> 01:07:49,075
Speaker 5:  like minimal devices. One would hope that you don't have to pay an extra

1124
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,995
Speaker 5:  subscription for the SOS communication. Yeah. I think

1125
01:07:51,995 --> 01:07:54,515
Speaker 1:  Apple can spot you for that one. Yeah. I just wanna say by the way, that

1126
01:07:54,515 --> 01:07:58,395
Speaker 1:  ever since you said it's different people in every video when they talk about

1127
01:07:58,395 --> 01:08:01,035
Speaker 1:  the people whose lives are saved, I can't stop thinking about if there's

1128
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:05,035
Speaker 1:  one person who's just like, you know, Richard just like

1129
01:08:05,035 --> 01:08:08,235
Speaker 1:  keeps falling down mountains and just like sends Tim Cook an email every

1130
01:08:08,235 --> 01:08:10,435
Speaker 1:  year and is like, buddy, you did it again. I'm still here.

1131
01:08:12,115 --> 01:08:15,805
Speaker 1:  I got, I got the SOS this time. We're cool. And he's like, my, my friends

1132
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:18,925
Speaker 1:  found me 'cause of this new feature. And he's just like, Tim Cook is just

1133
01:08:18,925 --> 01:08:21,965
Speaker 1:  like, stop sending this guy Apple watches. Like he's out there. And if it

1134
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:25,445
Speaker 1:  is you who keeps trying to die, but being saved by your Apple watch,

1135
01:08:26,085 --> 01:08:27,165
Speaker 1:  I, I would like to hear from you.

1136
01:08:27,725 --> 01:08:31,285
Speaker 5:  I also would love, I would love to interview you. We should do a, we would

1137
01:08:31,285 --> 01:08:35,245
Speaker 5:  love to do a special Tuesday episode. A hundred percent dissect your

1138
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:35,685
Speaker 5:  life. But

1139
01:08:35,685 --> 01:08:37,845
Speaker 1:  Yeah, he And I will come fall off Cliffs with you anytime

1140
01:08:38,485 --> 01:08:41,325
Speaker 5:  I look forward to it. I'm, you can go fall off. I have no desire to fall

1141
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:45,165
Speaker 5:  off. I've got training to do. I I I had a Charlie Hor horse

1142
01:08:45,185 --> 01:08:48,285
Speaker 5:  the other day from rolling over in my bed, so I'm aging And I can't take

1143
01:08:48,285 --> 01:08:52,125
Speaker 5:  these risks of falling off CL Cliffs, but I would love to

1144
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:55,125
Speaker 5:  interview you about falling off a cliff. So there we go. Yeah. Yeah.

1145
01:08:55,205 --> 01:08:58,285
Speaker 1:  I love this for us. All right, we gotta take a break. ViiV, I'm sure got

1146
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:01,805
Speaker 1:  more things to write about watches, but were we, we got more to talk about

1147
01:09:01,955 --> 01:09:02,965
Speaker 1:  this things. I, we have two

1148
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:05,365
Speaker 5:  Wrists and there are three watches I don't want to

1149
01:09:05,365 --> 01:09:08,685
Speaker 1:  Do. Can you do one as like an ankle monitor situation? Oh,

1150
01:09:08,705 --> 01:09:12,525
Speaker 5:  At some point. Many people have suggested this to me, which I don't know

1151
01:09:12,525 --> 01:09:13,845
Speaker 5:  how that makes me feel, but

1152
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:16,245
Speaker 1:  I think you string them all together and wear them like a choker around your

1153
01:09:16,245 --> 01:09:17,765
Speaker 1:  neck. V Thank you. Yeah,

1154
01:09:17,905 --> 01:09:18,365
Speaker 5:  As always

1155
01:09:18,535 --> 01:09:19,205
Speaker 1:  We'll be right back.

1156
01:09:59,545 --> 01:10:02,125
Speaker 2:  at warp dev slash vergecast.

1157
01:10:06,585 --> 01:10:10,265
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. One more thing to talk about and Jake

1158
01:10:10,715 --> 01:10:13,505
Speaker 1:  Kakis, it's you. Hi, Jake. Hey, it's good to see

1159
01:10:13,505 --> 01:10:15,185
Speaker 7:  You. They let you back in. They did.

1160
01:10:15,455 --> 01:10:19,385
Speaker 1:  Miracle of Miracles. It's possible this is the last vergecast I

1161
01:10:19,385 --> 01:10:21,425
Speaker 1:  will ever get to do, But that they, let me do one more. I'm

1162
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:21,985
Speaker 7:  Excited you're here.

1163
01:10:22,445 --> 01:10:26,425
Speaker 1:  You had a new experience for you. You've been at

1164
01:10:26,425 --> 01:10:29,785
Speaker 1:  The Verge for 650 years. You, you joined Yeah.

1165
01:10:30,325 --> 01:10:34,265
Speaker 1:  In in the, the Renaissance period, if I remember correctly. But this is

1166
01:10:34,445 --> 01:10:34,665
Speaker 1:  te

1167
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:36,625
Speaker 7:  If Im not, technology is very different back then. It is very

1168
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:40,425
Speaker 1:  Different. But if I'm not mistaken, this is the first time you have been

1169
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:42,825
Speaker 1:  to Cupertino for an iPhone launch, right?

1170
01:10:43,215 --> 01:10:46,785
Speaker 7:  This is my first time at Apple Park. Yeah, certainly my first iPhone

1171
01:10:47,105 --> 01:10:50,985
Speaker 7:  hardware event. And it was, you know, a new experience for me. It's,

1172
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:54,905
Speaker 7:  it's, it's very different watching it remotely, seeing all the

1173
01:10:54,905 --> 01:10:58,625
Speaker 7:  photos, reading the live blogs, and actually being here, seeing

1174
01:10:58,965 --> 01:11:02,705
Speaker 7:  the scenery being in the space. It's Apple really,

1175
01:11:03,605 --> 01:11:07,305
Speaker 7:  you know, you kind of look at it from afar and you go, oh, they really like

1176
01:11:07,365 --> 01:11:10,505
Speaker 7:  put a lot of polish on this place. And then you get there and you're like,

1177
01:11:11,055 --> 01:11:14,245
Speaker 7:  whew, that was a lot of work. Went into this thing. What

1178
01:11:14,245 --> 01:11:17,765
Speaker 1:  Stood out? Like it's been a long, crazy day. What, what are some of the like

1179
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:20,525
Speaker 1:  wildest moments of the day for you? Well,

1180
01:11:20,555 --> 01:11:23,205
Speaker 7:  Okay, if I can just talk about the space because I think this is something

1181
01:11:23,205 --> 01:11:26,765
Speaker 7:  that obviously most people don't see. They, they sh shoot their videos

1182
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:30,765
Speaker 7:  around campus and having now been on their campus for the first time, I,

1183
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:34,325
Speaker 7:  I really understand why like, it is a sculpted,

1184
01:11:34,355 --> 01:11:37,885
Speaker 7:  carefully crafted park and the park in the name.

1185
01:11:38,245 --> 01:11:42,145
Speaker 7:  I think externally as an observer has always felt, I don't know,

1186
01:11:42,145 --> 01:11:46,025
Speaker 7:  a little pretentious. And now being there, I'm like, nope. There's like

1187
01:11:46,025 --> 01:11:48,465
Speaker 7:  Rolling Hills, there's a ton of, it's an actual park.

1188
01:11:48,495 --> 01:11:48,785
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1189
01:11:49,075 --> 01:11:52,985
Speaker 7:  Trees. There's grass, like, it, it really does feel like a park and

1190
01:11:52,985 --> 01:11:56,865
Speaker 7:  there just happens to be a weird spaceship in the middle. So perhaps it is

1191
01:11:56,905 --> 01:12:00,705
Speaker 7:  a little bit pretentious to build that for yourself,

1192
01:12:00,725 --> 01:12:04,025
Speaker 7:  but it really is a, a, a very lovely, remarkable space. And you understand

1193
01:12:04,025 --> 01:12:07,385
Speaker 7:  why they're like, of course we're gonna show this thing off. Like of course

1194
01:12:07,385 --> 01:12:11,325
Speaker 7:  we're gonna dot ourselves around this campus for

1195
01:12:11,325 --> 01:12:15,205
Speaker 7:  these videos. And you know, the theater that they bring you into is just,

1196
01:12:15,305 --> 01:12:19,085
Speaker 7:  it, it it's gargantuan. It's like, I don't know,

1197
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,605
Speaker 7:  brutalist isn't quite right because it has obviously soft edges everywhere,

1198
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:25,725
Speaker 7:  but it's just, you know, towering walls,

1199
01:12:27,465 --> 01:12:30,765
Speaker 7:  you know, these Im immense views of the sky. It's very striking

1200
01:12:32,145 --> 01:12:34,405
Speaker 7:  And I, I think a lot of the

1201
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:39,495
Speaker 7:  hyping up of the space that they did, you know,

1202
01:12:40,165 --> 01:12:43,145
Speaker 7:  it doesn't necessarily come across in the photos and videos. And then when

1203
01:12:43,145 --> 01:12:46,305
Speaker 7:  you're there in the space, you understand why they put

1204
01:12:47,045 --> 01:12:50,865
Speaker 7:  so much energy in into telling people about this place. It really,

1205
01:12:50,885 --> 01:12:54,385
Speaker 7:  it really is very impressive. And, and you know, the

1206
01:12:54,575 --> 01:12:55,065
Speaker 7:  iPhones,

1207
01:12:56,655 --> 01:12:59,915
Speaker 7:  that's what we're here for. But as somebody who hadn't seen

1208
01:13:00,455 --> 01:13:03,795
Speaker 7:  the location before, really, really fascinating to get to go there.

1209
01:13:03,985 --> 01:13:07,835
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's one of the things I really like about going to WDC

1210
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:11,675
Speaker 1:  every year is that it is full of people who have never been to

1211
01:13:11,675 --> 01:13:15,555
Speaker 1:  Apple Park before. And I think a, there is something about Apple as a

1212
01:13:15,555 --> 01:13:18,995
Speaker 1:  company that like people are attached to in a way that is very unusual.

1213
01:13:20,335 --> 01:13:23,675
Speaker 1:  But there is something about that place. Like you And I have been to a lot

1214
01:13:23,675 --> 01:13:27,395
Speaker 1:  of corporate offices. Yes. And most of them are corporate offices.

1215
01:13:27,815 --> 01:13:31,755
Speaker 1:  And I think the, the only two places I've ever been that felt sort

1216
01:13:31,755 --> 01:13:35,435
Speaker 1:  of meaningfully different were, when I lived in Oakland, my

1217
01:13:35,755 --> 01:13:39,675
Speaker 1:  landlord happened to be a Pixar animator and so he just

1218
01:13:39,675 --> 01:13:43,635
Speaker 1:  took my wife And I on a tour of the Pixar offices and that was

1219
01:13:43,635 --> 01:13:47,075
Speaker 1:  like, that's a place that is also sort of like famously special and people

1220
01:13:47,095 --> 01:13:50,915
Speaker 1:  do like super elaborate decorations of their offices so that they look like

1221
01:13:50,915 --> 01:13:54,795
Speaker 1:  movie sets. That was very cool. And then for me, the first

1222
01:13:54,825 --> 01:13:58,715
Speaker 1:  time I went down the stairs at the Steve Jobs theater and

1223
01:13:58,715 --> 01:14:02,675
Speaker 1:  you're up in this huge sort of open waiting room that's

1224
01:14:02,675 --> 01:14:05,555
Speaker 1:  like all glass all the way around. And then you start to go down the stairs

1225
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:09,395
Speaker 1:  and the stairs are like basically carved out of marble Yeah.

1226
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:12,205
Speaker 1:  As you go all the way. And it's just like, there's something

1227
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:16,975
Speaker 1:  genuinely sort of special about it. And that is like, it, it

1228
01:14:16,975 --> 01:14:20,575
Speaker 1:  doesn't make me like the iPhones more, but it's like, God, they did a good

1229
01:14:20,575 --> 01:14:20,775
Speaker 1:  job.

1230
01:14:21,575 --> 01:14:25,535
Speaker 7:  I mean there's something like, religious isn't the right word, but when you're

1231
01:14:25,535 --> 01:14:28,935
Speaker 7:  looking up at that big staircase from down below,

1232
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:33,015
Speaker 7:  it's just this thing that towers above you and you feel your

1233
01:14:33,065 --> 01:14:37,055
Speaker 7:  scale within it. And I, I don't even mean to say that it gave me these

1234
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:40,815
Speaker 7:  feelings about Apple, but they clearly designed it to have an effect

1235
01:14:40,835 --> 01:14:44,815
Speaker 7:  on you. And I it's a remarkable piece of architecture when you're standing

1236
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:45,455
Speaker 7:  inside of it.

1237
01:14:45,725 --> 01:14:49,655
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like shouts to the architects is really what it is. They spent

1238
01:14:49,775 --> 01:14:52,855
Speaker 1:  a lot of money and did a very good job. It also, from what I can tell, seems

1239
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,575
Speaker 1:  like an awful place to work because you're like, I have a meeting over there

1240
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:58,775
Speaker 1:  and it's a three quarter of a mile walk. That's a different problem.

1241
01:14:58,845 --> 01:15:02,335
Speaker 7:  There's lots of golf carts. I was scoping out whether they had apple

1242
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:06,615
Speaker 7:  bikes. I think they do, they have pretty be single speed. So

1243
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,615
Speaker 7:  there, there's a, tell me if I'm wrong, I might be mixing up single speed

1244
01:15:09,615 --> 01:15:13,455
Speaker 7:  and fixie, but there's a chain, but it's one

1245
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:17,415
Speaker 7:  chain. I don't think there are gears. They're like this kind of soft

1246
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:21,295
Speaker 7:  gray silver, they look, they look nice, they look nice.

1247
01:15:21,345 --> 01:15:25,255
Speaker 1:  Gears are are too much visible work. Do you know what I mean?

1248
01:15:25,505 --> 01:15:28,575
Speaker 7:  Apple can't do, there was no chance there were gonna be gears on those. No

1249
01:15:28,675 --> 01:15:32,015
Speaker 1:  Ab never, I honestly, it's surprising they're not fixie bikes now that

1250
01:15:32,035 --> 01:15:35,135
Speaker 7:  You mentioned. Yeah. I'm honestly, I'm stunned. These things aren't like,

1251
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:39,415
Speaker 7:  there isn't like a hot market for these. Like if, if you're a

1252
01:15:39,525 --> 01:15:41,895
Speaker 7:  true Apple fan, you've got a lifted apple bike.

1253
01:15:42,365 --> 01:15:45,855
Speaker 1:  When I was living in Silicon Valley, you used to see the Google bikes all

1254
01:15:45,855 --> 01:15:49,375
Speaker 1:  over the place. People would steal them off of Google's campus and ride them

1255
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:52,815
Speaker 1:  to Caltrain or whatever. I don't think I've ever seen an Apple bike in, in

1256
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:56,655
Speaker 1:  the wild. So if, if you've seen one send us pictures Vergecast at The Verge

1257
01:15:56,655 --> 01:16:00,495
Speaker 1:  dot com, I wanna see all of your Apple bike spottings. But I

1258
01:16:00,495 --> 01:16:04,095
Speaker 1:  suspect there are large security guards who will

1259
01:16:04,515 --> 01:16:05,895
Speaker 1:  do crimes to you if you do that,

1260
01:16:06,675 --> 01:16:07,455
Speaker 7:  Be careful. Yeah.

1261
01:16:08,275 --> 01:16:10,895
Speaker 1:  So we've already talked about the phones, we've already talked about the

1262
01:16:10,895 --> 01:16:13,575
Speaker 1:  air pods, we've already talked to the watches. What I wanna do with you is

1263
01:16:13,575 --> 01:16:16,455
Speaker 1:  kind of cover off all the other stuff because it, at an event like this,

1264
01:16:16,765 --> 01:16:20,735
Speaker 1:  there's always a lot of other stuff. And the thing that jumped

1265
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:24,735
Speaker 1:  out to me the most, and I'm curious just to get your thoughts on

1266
01:16:24,735 --> 01:16:28,655
Speaker 1:  this, this felt like a very accessory heavy iPhone

1267
01:16:28,655 --> 01:16:31,735
Speaker 1:  event in a way that they typically aren't. They talked a bunch about a case,

1268
01:16:31,945 --> 01:16:35,335
Speaker 1:  there was a lot of noise about and crossbody strap that everybody had a lot

1269
01:16:35,335 --> 01:16:38,095
Speaker 1:  of feelings about. Like there was just a thing where they're like, we're

1270
01:16:38,095 --> 01:16:40,975
Speaker 1:  gonna launch a bunch of devices, but then we're gonna do kind of a lifestyle

1271
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:45,335
Speaker 1:  brandy thing around them. And I know you got to see some of the

1272
01:16:45,335 --> 01:16:48,575
Speaker 1:  devices, I don't know how many of the accessories were out there, but what

1273
01:16:48,575 --> 01:16:52,495
Speaker 1:  do you make of this push towards all

1274
01:16:52,495 --> 01:16:56,415
Speaker 1:  of this stuff that you can sort of attach to your devices right next

1275
01:16:56,475 --> 01:16:58,295
Speaker 1:  to the devices themselves?

1276
01:16:58,765 --> 01:17:02,695
Speaker 7:  Okay. People are so hyped for this crossbody strap really

1277
01:17:02,695 --> 01:17:06,655
Speaker 7:  are. And it is, it is not for me. I am not the demographic. I don't know

1278
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:08,895
Speaker 7:  who the demographic is, but they're out there. I've seen them.

1279
01:17:10,725 --> 01:17:14,485
Speaker 1:  I just think the idea that you're gonna buy a phone and just proudly

1280
01:17:14,595 --> 01:17:17,525
Speaker 1:  display it like pretty loosely on your body

1281
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:20,635
Speaker 1:  is just lunacy. Like, don't, don't do that.

1282
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:24,635
Speaker 7:  I, I think it's, it, it's bizarre. You're just like, I don't wanna know

1283
01:17:24,855 --> 01:17:27,955
Speaker 7:  too much about this phone. It's just gonna be floating around

1284
01:17:28,605 --> 01:17:32,555
Speaker 7:  while I'm not using it. I might hear it vibrate, I might, I don't

1285
01:17:32,555 --> 01:17:36,395
Speaker 7:  know. I'll find it eventually. It it feels like you just

1286
01:17:36,395 --> 01:17:39,835
Speaker 7:  like let it float off. I, it's not for me,

1287
01:17:41,095 --> 01:17:44,555
Speaker 7:  but there's, people are very excited. I don't know why. I think maybe it's

1288
01:17:44,635 --> 01:17:48,555
Speaker 7:  'cause a a new category for Apple, even though there's a trillion of

1289
01:17:48,555 --> 01:17:51,875
Speaker 7:  these things in existence. I think all their new cases have little

1290
01:17:52,065 --> 01:17:55,995
Speaker 7:  lanyard straps now because they know that this is a thing. They know people

1291
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:58,075
Speaker 7:  wanna wear them this way. Do they

1292
01:17:58,075 --> 01:18:01,315
Speaker 1:  Though, like, is is, is there actual evidence that this is a real thing that

1293
01:18:01,315 --> 01:18:02,315
Speaker 1:  exists? I've,

1294
01:18:02,315 --> 01:18:06,075
Speaker 7:  I've seen them around, I've seen them around New York. I, I can't quite tell

1295
01:18:06,075 --> 01:18:09,875
Speaker 7:  if it's a tourist thing or a Gen Z thing. I, I

1296
01:18:09,945 --> 01:18:13,875
Speaker 7:  like, I don't want to date myself here, but I suspect there is a

1297
01:18:14,075 --> 01:18:17,915
Speaker 7:  specific demographic and it's just like, it's not men in their

1298
01:18:18,155 --> 01:18:20,435
Speaker 7:  thirties. That's fair. Which like,

1299
01:18:22,285 --> 01:18:22,965
Speaker 7:  I don't know.

1300
01:18:25,275 --> 01:18:29,035
Speaker 7:  I, I like the pocket, the pocket still works for me. Yeah, sure.

1301
01:18:29,335 --> 01:18:31,355
Speaker 7:  I'm doing fine. But, you know, to to your point about like this being an

1302
01:18:31,355 --> 01:18:35,315
Speaker 7:  accessories heavy event, you know, I do think it's interesting

1303
01:18:35,315 --> 01:18:39,075
Speaker 7:  for us as phone reviewers And I think

1304
01:18:39,095 --> 01:18:42,315
Speaker 7:  for, for folks who are listening who are probably, you know, big fans of

1305
01:18:42,315 --> 01:18:45,795
Speaker 7:  technology, the accessories always feel like a little bit of an afterthought.

1306
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:50,315
Speaker 7:  And I think it is probably worth realizing that

1307
01:18:50,775 --> 01:18:54,755
Speaker 7:  the, these purchases go hand in hand for everybody. And if

1308
01:18:54,755 --> 01:18:58,675
Speaker 7:  the accessories don't work, the, the, the device doesn't necessarily work

1309
01:18:58,675 --> 01:19:02,355
Speaker 7:  for you. And I don't think, like if you go out in public, you're, you're

1310
01:19:02,355 --> 01:19:06,235
Speaker 7:  rarely going to see an iPhone without a case on it. You're, you,

1311
01:19:06,415 --> 01:19:09,955
Speaker 7:  you don't see air tags without things wrapped around them. Right. That's

1312
01:19:09,955 --> 01:19:13,795
Speaker 7:  true. So like Apple I think is necessarily seeing, okay, we need to pair

1313
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:17,435
Speaker 7:  these two things and yeah, they had a lot of different

1314
01:19:17,435 --> 01:19:21,315
Speaker 7:  options here. Obviously the big one was the return of

1315
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:26,275
Speaker 7:  the, the woven cases. This comes two years after the disaster of fine

1316
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:30,115
Speaker 7:  woven. They look very similar. This new one's called tech

1317
01:19:30,275 --> 01:19:33,275
Speaker 7:  woven, but they say it is much better.

1318
01:19:34,105 --> 01:19:38,035
Speaker 7:  They did not have them out in the demo area though, so I, I think

1319
01:19:38,275 --> 01:19:41,155
Speaker 7:  that was intentional. They probably knew people were going to immediately

1320
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:44,675
Speaker 7:  try to rub some keys against them to see what happens. Yeah.

1321
01:19:44,735 --> 01:19:48,635
Speaker 1:  I'm imagining every single reporter like ran out, grabbed the sharpest

1322
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:50,515
Speaker 1:  thing that they had. Oh yeah. And I was like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go find

1323
01:19:50,515 --> 01:19:53,835
Speaker 7:  That case. I mean, as soon as I got my hands on an iPhone air, I, I like

1324
01:19:53,835 --> 01:19:56,555
Speaker 7:  squeezed it a little. I'm like, I gotta see this Benz. Like I don't wanna

1325
01:19:56,615 --> 01:20:00,315
Speaker 7:  did it. There's, there's handlers there, you know, you can't too much.

1326
01:20:00,455 --> 01:20:04,355
Speaker 7:  But I, I was, you know, in my, in my limited testing, I

1327
01:20:04,355 --> 01:20:08,285
Speaker 7:  did not, you know, no flex yet. We'll, we'll we'll see why

1328
01:20:08,365 --> 01:20:08,645
Speaker 7:  that's good

1329
01:20:08,645 --> 01:20:11,085
Speaker 1:  Journalism. Usually that's what, that's when you gotta be like, oh no, look,

1330
01:20:11,405 --> 01:20:15,365
Speaker 1:  somebody's stealing a MacBook and then just like snap the phone and run

1331
01:20:15,365 --> 01:20:15,605
Speaker 1:  away.

1332
01:20:16,325 --> 01:20:20,125
Speaker 7:  I, you know, I thought maybe not on my first visit to, to their headquarters.

1333
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:24,405
Speaker 7:  I, I didn't want to get escorted out by security. But you know, I, I

1334
01:20:24,405 --> 01:20:27,605
Speaker 7:  gave a little flex for, for journalism. I gave a little flex and,

1335
01:20:27,705 --> 01:20:29,925
Speaker 1:  And okay, what did you think? We, we, we spent a bunch of time with Allison

1336
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:33,485
Speaker 1:  talking about the, The iPhone Air. But you, you're the only other person

1337
01:20:33,645 --> 01:20:37,385
Speaker 1:  I know who has touched the thing. What do you make, what do you make of

1338
01:20:37,385 --> 01:20:41,105
Speaker 7:  It? It's striking. It's striking how thin it is. It really is. It's, it's

1339
01:20:41,105 --> 01:20:45,095
Speaker 7:  a lovely piece of hardware. It is. I'm, I'm

1340
01:20:45,495 --> 01:20:49,335
Speaker 7:  a small phone guy as much as is possible these days, which is usually

1341
01:20:49,335 --> 01:20:53,135
Speaker 7:  like the 6.1 inch area. This is 6.3 inches,

1342
01:20:53,135 --> 01:20:56,855
Speaker 7:  definitely feels a little bit bigger. But I think because it's so thin,

1343
01:20:58,025 --> 01:21:00,725
Speaker 7:  it can get away with it a little bit more. It's not necessarily as big on

1344
01:21:00,725 --> 01:21:04,685
Speaker 7:  your person. They let me sneak into my pocket. It, it

1345
01:21:04,685 --> 01:21:08,645
Speaker 7:  like fits in the pocket. It feels light, it's

1346
01:21:08,645 --> 01:21:11,445
Speaker 7:  nice. It's, it's, it is a striking piece of hardware. And I suspect that

1347
01:21:11,485 --> 01:21:14,925
Speaker 7:  a lot of people, you see this in a showroom and you're like, hmm, that's

1348
01:21:14,925 --> 01:21:16,205
Speaker 7:  a pretty nice slogan. Yeah.

1349
01:21:16,425 --> 01:21:20,205
Speaker 1:  Can I tell you the funniest picture that I saw on our website today? Oh yeah.

1350
01:21:20,205 --> 01:21:24,005
Speaker 1:  Which I believe is courtesy of you is the very

1351
01:21:24,035 --> 01:21:27,805
Speaker 1:  thin iPhone air with a big fat, old battery case

1352
01:21:28,715 --> 01:21:30,085
Speaker 1:  just stuck to the back.

1353
01:21:30,675 --> 01:21:34,645
Speaker 7:  Okay. I'm, I don't even necessarily like wanna talk about it as it

1354
01:21:34,645 --> 01:21:37,685
Speaker 7:  relates to The iPhone Air people freaking love

1355
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:41,965
Speaker 7:  apple's battery packs. The old one was enormous

1356
01:21:42,145 --> 01:21:46,005
Speaker 7:  and chunky and the ugliest thing on earth. People love that

1357
01:21:46,005 --> 01:21:46,165
Speaker 7:  thing.

1358
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:49,845
Speaker 1:  You see them everywhere. It's the, the battery packs and the the

1359
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:52,405
Speaker 1:  MagSafe wallets that just are like, you know, the whatever. Yeah. You can

1360
01:21:52,405 --> 01:21:55,805
Speaker 1:  have two credit cards on it. I see those everywhere. So

1361
01:21:56,165 --> 01:21:59,925
Speaker 7:  I, it, it kind of surprises me that they're not bringing this

1362
01:21:59,925 --> 01:22:03,805
Speaker 7:  back for the other phones. Again, people really like this thing.

1363
01:22:04,305 --> 01:22:07,645
Speaker 7:  So it's just for The iPhone Air, which I have questions, I have questions.

1364
01:22:07,645 --> 01:22:10,805
Speaker 7:  If that means they have battery life concerns about the phone itself

1365
01:22:11,505 --> 01:22:14,125
Speaker 7:  or if they just know that people like these, and maybe this will help drive

1366
01:22:14,465 --> 01:22:17,445
Speaker 7:  iPhone air sales because people will go, I wanna pair these two things.

1367
01:22:19,365 --> 01:22:23,145
Speaker 7:  When you pair them together, it does sort of make you go, oh,

1368
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:26,985
Speaker 7:  why did I get The iPhone Air? Right. Like, 'cause if you have battery problems

1369
01:22:26,985 --> 01:22:30,545
Speaker 7:  with The iPhone Air, maybe you should have just gotten a bigger iPhone in

1370
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,585
Speaker 7:  the first place and Right. Because now you have a bigger thing altogether.

1371
01:22:32,605 --> 01:22:32,825
Speaker 7:  If

1372
01:22:32,825 --> 01:22:35,425
Speaker 1:  You're buying your phone for the battery life, don't buy The iPhone Air.

1373
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:40,145
Speaker 7:  I I will say The iPhone Air plus the battery pack,

1374
01:22:40,285 --> 01:22:44,185
Speaker 7:  the battery pack is a lot, a lot thinner than the old one. Okay.

1375
01:22:44,805 --> 01:22:48,665
Speaker 7:  It is thicker than The iPhone Air still so ever so slightly

1376
01:22:48,665 --> 01:22:52,345
Speaker 7:  thicker. So you're basically doubling the thickness of The iPhone Air, which

1377
01:22:52,495 --> 01:22:56,175
Speaker 7:  I'll say still doesn't feel terrible. Right. It, it, that

1378
01:22:56,535 --> 01:23:00,295
Speaker 7:  together feels like a, a reasonably sized phone, but it's

1379
01:23:00,295 --> 01:23:02,775
Speaker 7:  bigger than other iPhones. So, so it's,

1380
01:23:02,955 --> 01:23:04,815
Speaker 1:  But it's in two pieces and more expensive.

1381
01:23:05,195 --> 01:23:08,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's in two pieces. You can lose one of them. You have to charge both.

1382
01:23:08,085 --> 01:23:11,325
Speaker 1:  You've a deconstructed iPhone 17 pro with worse features.

1383
01:23:11,915 --> 01:23:15,245
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, if, if you're just going out to the store, you

1384
01:23:15,245 --> 01:23:18,445
Speaker 7:  leave your battery pack behind. If you're going for your entire day, you

1385
01:23:18,445 --> 01:23:19,925
Speaker 7:  know, you, you get a double iPhone.

1386
01:23:20,835 --> 01:23:24,485
Speaker 1:  Sure. I love this for you. This is, this is the optimism we come here for.

1387
01:23:24,725 --> 01:23:24,965
Speaker 1:  This

1388
01:23:24,965 --> 01:23:27,925
Speaker 7:  Is, this is what you're gonna see everywhere

1389
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:29,805
Speaker 7:  starting 2026.

1390
01:23:30,565 --> 01:23:34,405
Speaker 1:  I mean, you're, you're, you're probably right about that. When you were

1391
01:23:34,405 --> 01:23:38,285
Speaker 1:  in the room, I assume it was like, so just for folks

1392
01:23:38,285 --> 01:23:41,285
Speaker 1:  who haven't been there, you, you leave the Steve Jobs theater and right behind

1393
01:23:41,305 --> 01:23:45,245
Speaker 1:  it is this like big open, airy, hands-on area And I

1394
01:23:45,245 --> 01:23:47,525
Speaker 1:  have to assume that it was like

1395
01:23:48,465 --> 01:23:51,635
Speaker 1:  75% people clamoring to get to The iPhone Air,

1396
01:23:51,975 --> 01:23:53,915
Speaker 1:  25%. Everything else,

1397
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:58,515
Speaker 7:  It, it was, I, it felt to me like an even split between the,

1398
01:23:58,655 --> 01:24:02,315
Speaker 7:  The iPhone Air and the Orange

1399
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:03,875
Speaker 7:  iPhone Pro. Oh,

1400
01:24:04,235 --> 01:24:04,675
Speaker 1:  Fascinating.

1401
01:24:05,015 --> 01:24:08,475
Speaker 7:  At, at The iPhone pro table, all the other colors. Who cares

1402
01:24:09,445 --> 01:24:13,275
Speaker 7:  White, what is this? Gotta get that orange one. There are lines

1403
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:16,595
Speaker 7:  for the orange one. I had to elbow my way in to get the orange one.

1404
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:21,035
Speaker 7:  That, that's what people wanna see. Which I think it could just be for

1405
01:24:21,035 --> 01:24:24,995
Speaker 7:  this crowd. It is the most new looking iPhone pro.

1406
01:24:25,495 --> 01:24:28,315
Speaker 7:  But yeah, people are, it, it's an interesting one for Apple. They don't usually

1407
01:24:28,315 --> 01:24:31,835
Speaker 7:  go that bold, that bright, but yeah, you get out there

1408
01:24:32,135 --> 01:24:35,995
Speaker 7:  and people are, are, it's packed. It's like a mad rush to get

1409
01:24:36,015 --> 01:24:39,855
Speaker 7:  out there. And Apple has, I dunno,

1410
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:43,815
Speaker 7:  dozens and dozens of, of demo stations. It's sort of this weird freeform

1411
01:24:43,815 --> 01:24:47,705
Speaker 7:  thing where they've got representatives standing by to

1412
01:24:47,705 --> 01:24:51,505
Speaker 7:  demo the phones. Nobody really wants them to demo the phones.

1413
01:24:51,605 --> 01:24:55,305
Speaker 7:  And so everybody's grabbing the phones. There's, you know, I think

1414
01:24:55,305 --> 01:24:55,625
Speaker 7:  there's

1415
01:24:57,485 --> 01:25:01,335
Speaker 7:  written journalists who are trying to get photos really fast

1416
01:25:01,355 --> 01:25:04,575
Speaker 7:  and impressions really fast so that they can go back and, and write stuff

1417
01:25:04,575 --> 01:25:08,255
Speaker 7:  on their laptops. There's talkers who are recording video, there's people

1418
01:25:08,255 --> 01:25:12,215
Speaker 7:  with full camera setups on tripods. So it's, it's just

1419
01:25:12,335 --> 01:25:15,775
Speaker 7:  a complete rush, a complete madhouse in there.

1420
01:25:16,115 --> 01:25:19,975
Speaker 7:  And Apple is doing their best to, to keep order as everybody

1421
01:25:19,975 --> 01:25:22,255
Speaker 7:  kind of scrambles and bounces between the new devices.

1422
01:25:23,215 --> 01:25:25,855
Speaker 1:  Interesting that the orange one was such a big hit. And this, this is now

1423
01:25:25,855 --> 01:25:29,735
Speaker 1:  three for three of VERGE guests on this podcast who are into the orange iPhone,

1424
01:25:29,785 --> 01:25:32,055
Speaker 1:  which I would say was pretty controversial on the internet.

1425
01:25:32,535 --> 01:25:36,255
Speaker 7:  I wanna say I I said it was very popular. Oh, what

1426
01:25:36,475 --> 01:25:37,655
Speaker 1:  Are only two for three? Okay.

1427
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:42,865
Speaker 7:  It's, I'm not an orange guy in general. It's,

1428
01:25:42,865 --> 01:25:46,425
Speaker 7:  there is like a, a little, not an autumn coppery something to it. It's a

1429
01:25:46,425 --> 01:25:49,505
Speaker 7:  little bold for me. I don't know if I would, if I would do the orange. It

1430
01:25:49,505 --> 01:25:53,145
Speaker 7:  is a weird color. It's like right in time for, for Halloween or pumpkin

1431
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:54,345
Speaker 7:  spice season or something.

1432
01:25:55,905 --> 01:25:59,825
Speaker 1:  I I do appreciate the swing that it is, right. Like it is,

1433
01:25:59,825 --> 01:26:03,575
Speaker 1:  yeah. I think Apple has been guiltier than almost

1434
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:07,495
Speaker 1:  anybody of doing incredibly boring colors where

1435
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:10,775
Speaker 1:  it's like, it's like, look, we made a, we made a blue

1436
01:26:11,605 --> 01:26:15,575
Speaker 1:  iPad mini that is like essentially not blue.

1437
01:26:15,645 --> 01:26:18,095
Speaker 1:  Like this isn't even a color. What are we doing here? You can't

1438
01:26:18,095 --> 01:26:18,455
Speaker 7:  Tell. Yeah,

1439
01:26:18,635 --> 01:26:21,735
Speaker 1:  No. And so to actually come out and be like, and there was actually a bunch

1440
01:26:21,735 --> 01:26:24,655
Speaker 1:  of this, there's some of this with the, the tech woven cases. There's some

1441
01:26:24,655 --> 01:26:27,935
Speaker 1:  of this with the, the crossbody strap. There's some of this, there's just

1442
01:26:27,965 --> 01:26:31,855
Speaker 1:  real like showy energy in some of these devices in a

1443
01:26:31,855 --> 01:26:34,895
Speaker 1:  way that I actually really appreciate. Not all of it is for me, but like

1444
01:26:35,015 --> 01:26:38,975
Speaker 1:  I, I appreciate the loudness of it. There's not a lot of that in

1445
01:26:38,975 --> 01:26:39,415
Speaker 1:  tech right now.

1446
01:26:39,935 --> 01:26:43,135
Speaker 7:  I I think that's sort of the story here too, right?

1447
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:47,895
Speaker 7:  Not everybody upgrades their phone on a regular cadence. They, they

1448
01:26:47,895 --> 01:26:51,775
Speaker 7:  wait until it dies. And this year in

1449
01:26:51,815 --> 01:26:55,095
Speaker 7:  a lot of ways was designed to say, Hey, in case you haven't been paying attention,

1450
01:26:55,255 --> 01:26:59,215
Speaker 7:  a lot has changed. Right? Year over year, maybe not

1451
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:03,015
Speaker 7:  so much if you're going back a few years. Okay, now there's a

1452
01:27:03,015 --> 01:27:06,695
Speaker 7:  brand new design in the pro, right? There's a whole new airline.

1453
01:27:07,035 --> 01:27:10,495
Speaker 7:  Do you need two cameras? Who cares? No one camera is actually four cameras.

1454
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:14,415
Speaker 7:  What? Like it's, everything is new and different. There's this new accessory

1455
01:27:14,415 --> 01:27:18,215
Speaker 7:  options, lots of new colors, everything has a new name. So yeah,

1456
01:27:18,335 --> 01:27:22,295
Speaker 7:  I think you're right. Like this is a year about being kind of flashy

1457
01:27:22,475 --> 01:27:26,015
Speaker 7:  And I think that's very much by design to show like, hey, there's been a

1458
01:27:26,015 --> 01:27:29,655
Speaker 7:  generational shift even if it wasn't necessarily these phones. And you can,

1459
01:27:29,705 --> 01:27:32,895
Speaker 7:  maybe you can make the argument that it's these phones. I think they're saying

1460
01:27:33,815 --> 01:27:37,615
Speaker 7:  cumulatively a lot has changed since the last time we changed up our

1461
01:27:37,615 --> 01:27:41,295
Speaker 7:  designs. And that's very true. 'cause it's been since I think 2019

1462
01:27:41,565 --> 01:27:44,735
Speaker 7:  when we got this basically same design on The iPhone 11 pro.

1463
01:27:44,965 --> 01:27:48,735
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I, and we have been hearing from a lot of folks. I think for our audience

1464
01:27:48,735 --> 01:27:52,575
Speaker 1:  in particular, at least the 13 seems to be the sweet spot where there

1465
01:27:52,575 --> 01:27:55,415
Speaker 1:  are, there were a lot of 13 owners

1466
01:27:56,365 --> 01:27:59,895
Speaker 1:  looking at this event being like, is am I finally gonna pull the trigger

1467
01:27:59,895 --> 01:28:03,695
Speaker 1:  here? Which feels about right, right. Like it's, it's now

1468
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:07,735
Speaker 1:  four generations ago, which is I think a reasonable amount of

1469
01:28:07,735 --> 01:28:11,375
Speaker 1:  time for a phone to last now. And if you're coming from the 13,

1470
01:28:11,445 --> 01:28:15,295
Speaker 1:  like a lot of stuff is gonna be a lot better. And also it's gonna be

1471
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:18,055
Speaker 1:  orange, right? Like yeah. Right. And that, that counts for something. And

1472
01:28:18,055 --> 01:28:21,815
Speaker 1:  I think you, you're like, and it's going to, you're gonna wear it, you know,

1473
01:28:21,815 --> 01:28:25,735
Speaker 1:  with a weird sash across your body. Like it's, your phone is gonna feel

1474
01:28:26,205 --> 01:28:29,175
Speaker 1:  like you bought a new thing. And I think, I think you're right. That's hard

1475
01:28:29,175 --> 01:28:32,815
Speaker 1:  to come by in a lot of ways right now. And, and finding even

1476
01:28:32,815 --> 01:28:35,575
Speaker 1:  simple ways to get that done is pretty interesting.

1477
01:28:36,815 --> 01:28:39,735
Speaker 1:  Speaking of things that are going to change everybody's phones a lot, not

1478
01:28:39,735 --> 01:28:43,175
Speaker 1:  a lot of software talk today. So we, we have all these other

1479
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,095
Speaker 1:  companies that are basically just like getting on stage and saying, here

1480
01:28:46,095 --> 01:28:49,175
Speaker 1:  is our phone. It does ai. That is it's whole purpose. It's, it's a brick

1481
01:28:49,195 --> 01:28:53,095
Speaker 1:  for ai. I think Apple probably said AI a couple of

1482
01:28:53,095 --> 01:28:57,055
Speaker 1:  times, but these are not AI devices. They didn't talk about Siri, they

1483
01:28:57,055 --> 01:29:01,015
Speaker 1:  didn't talk about Apple Intelligence. It was just a completely different

1484
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:04,765
Speaker 1:  way of talking about smartphones than we've seen recently.

1485
01:29:05,105 --> 01:29:06,245
Speaker 1:  Was that weird in the room?

1486
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That's so funny. You're completely like the pixel tent. They held up

1487
01:29:09,945 --> 01:29:13,925
Speaker 7:  the same phone Yeah. Like the exact same thing and said now

1488
01:29:13,925 --> 01:29:17,165
Speaker 7:  with with more ai Yeah. The iPhones. Yeah. It, it's like

1489
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:21,325
Speaker 7:  there's maybe some small software tricks to work with

1490
01:29:21,325 --> 01:29:24,645
Speaker 7:  what they've already got or some of the tweaks they're making. Right. You

1491
01:29:24,645 --> 01:29:28,485
Speaker 7:  know, I think if you look at the watches, okay, there's some where where

1492
01:29:28,485 --> 01:29:31,965
Speaker 7:  the, the AirPods Yeah. They have some, some software to, to work with

1493
01:29:31,965 --> 01:29:34,325
Speaker 1:  With That's fair. Yeah. The live translation and stuff that, that counts

1494
01:29:34,325 --> 01:29:35,165
Speaker 1:  as a I that's

1495
01:29:35,355 --> 01:29:38,685
Speaker 7:  True. But I, I do think you're right. Like there's not any

1496
01:29:38,795 --> 01:29:42,725
Speaker 7:  exclusive certainly AI features, which, which is what

1497
01:29:42,725 --> 01:29:45,845
Speaker 7:  you would expect to be the big deal. At least flagship ones beyond that,

1498
01:29:45,845 --> 01:29:49,605
Speaker 7:  that sort of, you know, live translate stuff. The one place I

1499
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:53,005
Speaker 7:  did clock some changes is maybe in the front facing camera, right? There's

1500
01:29:53,005 --> 01:29:56,085
Speaker 7:  a whole bunch of software stuff going on

1501
01:29:56,785 --> 01:30:00,685
Speaker 7:  to work with that new center stage camera where it keeps changing shape around

1502
01:30:00,705 --> 01:30:04,525
Speaker 7:  you. It's fascinating as far as I can tell, there just isn't

1503
01:30:04,585 --> 01:30:08,485
Speaker 7:  an option to shoot with the entire sensor, right? Hmm. You can, you

1504
01:30:08,485 --> 01:30:12,365
Speaker 7:  have to shoot with it in its wide or portrait setup

1505
01:30:12,505 --> 01:30:16,205
Speaker 7:  or doing one of its wacky things. You can

1506
01:30:16,205 --> 01:30:19,725
Speaker 7:  control it manually, but it really is designed as a set it and forget it

1507
01:30:19,725 --> 01:30:23,665
Speaker 7:  thing, which is interesting right. That that's working

1508
01:30:23,725 --> 01:30:27,505
Speaker 7:  on how the hardware works. But other than that, I agree with you. I don't

1509
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:30,665
Speaker 7:  think it's a big software year. And I think if you look at a lot of apple's

1510
01:30:30,665 --> 01:30:34,425
Speaker 7:  changes, not just to The iPhone line, but to the MacBooks, the

1511
01:30:34,425 --> 01:30:37,865
Speaker 7:  watches in recent years, their big advantage

1512
01:30:38,285 --> 01:30:41,545
Speaker 7:  is is hardware, right? It's silicon, it's sensors.

1513
01:30:41,935 --> 01:30:45,705
Speaker 7:  They're so far ahead of the game in most places. They're

1514
01:30:45,705 --> 01:30:49,415
Speaker 7:  able to, you know, they, they introduced a new

1515
01:30:49,525 --> 01:30:53,015
Speaker 7:  chip for several of their networking things. They

1516
01:30:53,085 --> 01:30:57,055
Speaker 7:  updated their modem six months after their last modem. That's true.

1517
01:30:57,305 --> 01:31:00,775
Speaker 7:  Right? No one else is doing this. I don't know, I don't know if they need

1518
01:31:00,775 --> 01:31:03,535
Speaker 7:  their own modem. Maybe they do. We'll find out. But

1519
01:31:04,475 --> 01:31:07,775
Speaker 7:  that's where their focus really seems to be. It's, it's getting these edges

1520
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:11,775
Speaker 7:  with hardware And I suspect they'll have a

1521
01:31:11,935 --> 01:31:15,895
Speaker 7:  software story again soon. But, you know, I think they were

1522
01:31:16,015 --> 01:31:18,975
Speaker 7:  probably hoping it was gonna be AI stuff and, and we know how that went.

1523
01:31:19,445 --> 01:31:22,295
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And then, then they thought it was gonna be liquid glass and

1524
01:31:23,635 --> 01:31:26,535
Speaker 1:  boy, have I been using those betas for a while? And boy do I still hate liquid

1525
01:31:26,535 --> 01:31:27,735
Speaker 1:  glass? It's

1526
01:31:28,545 --> 01:31:28,895
Speaker 7:  There.

1527
01:31:30,075 --> 01:31:31,015
Speaker 1:  It it sure is.

1528
01:31:31,605 --> 01:31:31,895
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1529
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:36,055
Speaker 1:  I think that's about the best you can say for it. And I think, again, like

1530
01:31:36,055 --> 01:31:36,895
Speaker 1:  if I were to be

1531
01:31:38,675 --> 01:31:42,015
Speaker 1:  the most glass half empty about all of this that I could be,

1532
01:31:42,715 --> 01:31:46,535
Speaker 1:  you could paint a real story about a lot of what Apple is doing here

1533
01:31:46,535 --> 01:31:47,655
Speaker 1:  that is very like

1534
01:31:49,495 --> 01:31:52,575
Speaker 1:  lipstick on a pig, right? That they're like, well we don't have any actually

1535
01:31:52,635 --> 01:31:56,135
Speaker 1:  new product ideas, we're just gonna make it all look different.

1536
01:31:56,475 --> 01:32:00,445
Speaker 1:  And that is very unapply. Right? I think the, the

1537
01:32:00,445 --> 01:32:03,965
Speaker 1:  thing that Apple has done so successfully, so for so long is that it has

1538
01:32:04,065 --> 01:32:07,925
Speaker 1:  had better product vision than any of its

1539
01:32:08,555 --> 01:32:12,125
Speaker 1:  competitors. And so everybody was like, oh, here's a box for playing music

1540
01:32:12,185 --> 01:32:15,205
Speaker 1:  on. Right? Like Apple was the one that understood what that is supposed to

1541
01:32:15,205 --> 01:32:18,405
Speaker 1:  look like and how that's supposed to work. What's so fascinating about Apple

1542
01:32:18,405 --> 01:32:21,965
Speaker 1:  right now is that what it is really good at is exactly what you're saying.

1543
01:32:21,965 --> 01:32:25,405
Speaker 1:  It is able to just out execute at like a very

1544
01:32:26,155 --> 01:32:30,035
Speaker 1:  like, infrastructural level. All of its competitors

1545
01:32:30,035 --> 01:32:33,995
Speaker 1:  like it, it's, it's chips are just so much better than

1546
01:32:33,995 --> 01:32:37,755
Speaker 1:  everybody else's. It. The rest of it almost doesn't matter. Its products

1547
01:32:37,755 --> 01:32:41,555
Speaker 1:  are going to be better because it has that and now it's, it's

1548
01:32:41,705 --> 01:32:45,275
Speaker 1:  it's spreading that out into like you're talking about some of the, the neural

1549
01:32:45,275 --> 01:32:48,435
Speaker 1:  engine stuff and some of the networking chips and they're just like really

1550
01:32:48,435 --> 01:32:51,795
Speaker 1:  ready to take a knife to Qualcomm with all of the modem stuff as quickly

1551
01:32:51,795 --> 01:32:55,435
Speaker 1:  as possible. And it is like, that is now Apple's edge.

1552
01:32:55,545 --> 01:32:59,515
Speaker 1:  It's not like the people in the, the design studio with

1553
01:32:59,515 --> 01:33:02,675
Speaker 1:  the blonde wood tables that everybody talked about for forever in these like

1554
01:33:02,675 --> 01:33:06,435
Speaker 1:  hushed reverent tones. That's not their advantage anymore. Their advantage

1555
01:33:06,655 --> 01:33:09,995
Speaker 1:  is like the deeply unsexy computer stuff.

1556
01:33:10,855 --> 01:33:12,075
Speaker 1:  And it's fascinating.

1557
01:33:12,395 --> 01:33:16,155
Speaker 7:  I think you can look at this a as a good thing or a bad

1558
01:33:16,155 --> 01:33:19,515
Speaker 7:  thing. Right? Does Apple have a grand vision

1559
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:24,635
Speaker 7:  for how to change smartphones to make them work better for us?

1560
01:33:25,665 --> 01:33:28,765
Speaker 7:  It does not seem that way. No. Right. I don't think they have been building

1561
01:33:28,785 --> 01:33:30,605
Speaker 7:  toward that over the past few years,

1562
01:33:30,865 --> 01:33:33,365
Speaker 1:  To be fair. I don't know that anybody does, but I certainly don't think there's

1563
01:33:33,365 --> 01:33:34,285
Speaker 1:  any evidence that Apple does.

1564
01:33:34,505 --> 01:33:38,365
Speaker 7:  No, no, I agree with you. It it, it might not be there. This may just

1565
01:33:38,365 --> 01:33:41,755
Speaker 7:  be what the product is. Are they able to

1566
01:33:42,235 --> 01:33:46,075
Speaker 7:  iterate every year through hardware to make it a little bit better and a

1567
01:33:46,075 --> 01:33:48,195
Speaker 7:  little bit better and a little bit better? And are they able to do that better

1568
01:33:48,195 --> 01:33:51,715
Speaker 7:  than most other companies because of their iron grip on their

1569
01:33:51,995 --> 01:33:55,635
Speaker 7:  hardware supply chain and you know, their their deep

1570
01:33:55,995 --> 01:33:59,395
Speaker 7:  engineering team? Absolutely. Right. And that's what, that's what we saw

1571
01:33:59,395 --> 01:34:02,955
Speaker 7:  again, right. It's like little tweaks everywhere. Right. We're gonna

1572
01:34:02,955 --> 01:34:05,475
Speaker 7:  upgrade some of the cameras. We're gonna add a bunch of

1573
01:34:06,605 --> 01:34:09,545
Speaker 7:  flashy if confusing new camera features. I think I

1574
01:34:09,545 --> 01:34:12,185
Speaker 1:  Agree with all of that. And it, it actually leads me to the last question

1575
01:34:12,185 --> 01:34:16,065
Speaker 1:  that I have for you, which is that you are kind of famously an Android

1576
01:34:16,125 --> 01:34:19,985
Speaker 1:  guy in a, in a world full of iPhone people. That's actually

1577
01:34:19,985 --> 01:34:23,945
Speaker 1:  statistically not true at all. But it, it, it often feels that

1578
01:34:23,965 --> 01:34:24,985
Speaker 1:  way, at least among

1579
01:34:24,985 --> 01:34:25,865
Speaker 7:  The Verge Yeah. In the

1580
01:34:25,865 --> 01:34:29,745
Speaker 1:  Group chats. Is is there anything here that tempts you back to the, The

1581
01:34:29,745 --> 01:34:33,105
Speaker 1:  iPhone side of things? It's a little bit, we've seen kind of the, the swings

1582
01:34:33,105 --> 01:34:36,465
Speaker 1:  from these companies now are you, are you tempted towards an iPhone?

1583
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:40,885
Speaker 7:  I mean the, the big thing for me is cameras, right? I I, I'm going to

1584
01:34:40,945 --> 01:34:44,925
Speaker 7:  go more or less where the best camera system is. And I, I

1585
01:34:45,525 --> 01:34:48,565
Speaker 7:  honestly for the past few years, I feel like it's been a wash. Right.

1586
01:34:49,235 --> 01:34:53,045
Speaker 7:  Went to the pixels a while ago. That's right. And I think you,

1587
01:34:53,065 --> 01:34:56,045
Speaker 7:  you could, I think by the time that you're pixel peeping to be like, well,

1588
01:34:56,775 --> 01:34:58,405
Speaker 7:  white balance. Alright.

1589
01:34:58,915 --> 01:35:02,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. It's been a matter of taste as much as anything for, for a while

1590
01:35:02,345 --> 01:35:02,565
Speaker 1:  now.

1591
01:35:03,005 --> 01:35:06,525
Speaker 7:  Absolutely. Yeah. The cameras are getting better, right? The the new

1592
01:35:06,595 --> 01:35:10,385
Speaker 7:  telephoto, you know, we've only seen demo shots.

1593
01:35:10,445 --> 01:35:13,825
Speaker 7:  Of course they look gorgeous. That's how it always is. Yeah. But I'm intrigued.

1594
01:35:13,825 --> 01:35:15,425
Speaker 7:  They say the sensor's a lot bigger.

1595
01:35:16,975 --> 01:35:20,505
Speaker 7:  They are doing a bunch of, you know,

1596
01:35:21,165 --> 01:35:24,985
Speaker 7:  normal zooming enhancement instead of AI

1597
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:28,745
Speaker 7:  zoom enhancement and hopefully it looks

1598
01:35:28,775 --> 01:35:32,665
Speaker 7:  good and is real. So, you know, I I think

1599
01:35:32,665 --> 01:35:36,145
Speaker 7:  some of the others are, are maybe not moving as fast in that department.

1600
01:35:36,845 --> 01:35:40,625
Speaker 7:  The front facing camera thing is, is weird and trippy, but

1601
01:35:40,645 --> 01:35:43,385
Speaker 7:  I'm interested, you know, it's, it's a big new sensor,

1602
01:35:45,665 --> 01:35:49,565
Speaker 7:  you know, it's, it's a, the redesign is, is nice. It looks nice.

1603
01:35:49,805 --> 01:35:52,405
Speaker 7:  I don't think like that's necessarily the reason to buy it.

1604
01:35:53,705 --> 01:35:57,205
Speaker 7:  But if you've got an old phone, you know, that's, that's

1605
01:35:58,235 --> 01:36:01,565
Speaker 7:  certainly a telling point that things have changed. I think for somebody

1606
01:36:01,565 --> 01:36:05,235
Speaker 7:  on Android or somebody who's been on Pixel, you know, it's these

1607
01:36:05,235 --> 01:36:08,915
Speaker 7:  iterative upgrades, right? It's the same story. Do I love the camera

1608
01:36:08,915 --> 01:36:12,875
Speaker 7:  control button? Do I love how it works with the new camera features?

1609
01:36:13,605 --> 01:36:14,955
Speaker 7:  Maybe. Maybe. We'll see.

1610
01:36:15,905 --> 01:36:18,605
Speaker 1:  It doesn't sound like you're tempted towards an iPhone. That was like a very

1611
01:36:18,605 --> 01:36:21,005
Speaker 1:  nice way of saying, nah, I'm good. I,

1612
01:36:21,705 --> 01:36:25,245
Speaker 7:  Listen, I don't think we have enough time for this, but I, I've got like

1613
01:36:25,425 --> 01:36:29,365
Speaker 7:  an hour long thing about notification management on iPhones. Oh

1614
01:36:30,145 --> 01:36:33,165
Speaker 7:  boy. Oh boy. It's not All right. It's not good,

1615
01:36:33,555 --> 01:36:37,325
Speaker 1:  Jake. If it wasn't 11:03 PM where I am, I would sign up

1616
01:36:37,345 --> 01:36:40,925
Speaker 1:  for that right now. But luckily you And I have a lot of podcasts to hosts

1617
01:36:41,105 --> 01:36:43,365
Speaker 1:  for do this fall. We do. So we're, we're gonna have some time to do this.

1618
01:36:43,585 --> 01:36:46,085
Speaker 1:  All right, for now. You need to go. I need to go.

1619
01:36:47,585 --> 01:36:50,365
Speaker 1:  I'm very glad you got to go to Cupertino. This is like, this is a fun thing.

1620
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:53,245
Speaker 1:  You And I have been on opposite sides of this where you've been like telling

1621
01:36:53,265 --> 01:36:56,645
Speaker 1:  me what to do as I run around Cupertino a million times. So it was, it was

1622
01:36:56,645 --> 01:36:59,205
Speaker 1:  fun to get to watch you do the chaos all on your own.

1623
01:36:59,785 --> 01:37:03,205
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. I have so much more sympathy for you now. I'm

1624
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:06,245
Speaker 7:  I've, it's a weird day. I'm sorry for everything I've ever said.

1625
01:37:06,435 --> 01:37:09,645
Speaker 1:  It's a weird day and, and you're always like, you're always like, what are

1626
01:37:09,645 --> 01:37:12,325
Speaker 1:  they doing? And the answer is they're just sort of wandering aimlessly around

1627
01:37:12,325 --> 01:37:13,805
Speaker 1:  Apple Park trying to figure out where they are.

1628
01:37:14,075 --> 01:37:15,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah, exactly. It's

1629
01:37:15,285 --> 01:37:19,125
Speaker 1:  A life. All right, Jake, thank you Zoe. Good to see you buddy. Later.

1630
01:37:19,985 --> 01:37:22,485
Speaker 1:  All right, that's it for the show today. Thank you to everybody who came

1631
01:37:22,485 --> 01:37:26,125
Speaker 1:  on with me. It's pure chaos being in Cupertino for one of these events. So

1632
01:37:26,125 --> 01:37:30,005
Speaker 1:  please know it's a heroic effort to be on The Vergecast on Apple Day. And

1635
01:37:36,575 --> 01:37:39,525

1636
01:37:39,585 --> 01:37:42,925
Speaker 1:  new and old devices are gonna get a bunch of new software. Liquid Glass,

1637
01:37:42,965 --> 01:37:46,045
Speaker 1:  I think is gonna like, kind of blow some people's minds both in good and

1638
01:37:46,065 --> 01:37:49,405
Speaker 1:  bad ways. So we, we have a lot of Apple stuff to talk about. And if you have

1639
01:37:49,645 --> 01:37:53,445

1647
