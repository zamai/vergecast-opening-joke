00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,500
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Sustainable Supply Chain

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,300
Speaker 2:  economics. I'm your friend, David Pierce. And I am currently packing up to

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,100
Speaker 2:  go on vacation. I'm off next week and we're gonna go visit some family and

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,620
Speaker 2:  spend some time relaxing. So I'm getting everything ready. I dunno if you're

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,300
Speaker 2:  like me in this way, but I realized for the first time in getting ready for

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,140
Speaker 2:  this trip that my packing strategy is to basically just like

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,940
Speaker 2:  randomly heave a bunch of shirts and pants into a bag without even looking

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,780
Speaker 2:  at it. And then spend three days carefully curating all of my

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,660
Speaker 2:  technology. I might have my priorities wrong here. I have my laptop,

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,860
Speaker 2:  I have my phone, an iPad and a Kindle. All of which I'm gonna spend

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,500
Speaker 2:  the next several days making sure are perfectly charged. The iPad

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,580
Speaker 2:  has like 9,000 hours of TV and movies downloaded, even though

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,460
Speaker 2:  I'm driving And I have no idea when I'll watch them. But anyway, I did that

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,180
Speaker 2:  and they're there now. I bought three new books in addition to the several

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,980
Speaker 2:  dozen I already own that I haven't read yet. I have Chargers and

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,700
Speaker 2:  backup chargers with me. I even have an SD card reader in this little

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,820
Speaker 2:  bag here, despite the fact that nothing I'm bringing uses an SD card.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,220
Speaker 2:  I have wired headphones, I have wireless headphones, And I, have a pair of

20
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,220
Speaker 2:  Bose headphones that is both wired and wireless. I might have

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,940
Speaker 2:  a problem y'all, but I guess if our car breaks down and we have to spend

22
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,780
Speaker 2:  an entire day waiting and watching all of season two of the Bear on Hulu

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,540
Speaker 2:  when there's no service, I, I guess I'm good to go. So

24
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,700
Speaker 2:  there's that. Anyway, I have a lot of stuff left to do. Somehow

25
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,780
Speaker 2:  it's gonna be a scene. Anyway, we have a great show for you today. First,

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,180
Speaker 2:  we're gonna spend some time with Carl Pay the CEO of Nothing, talking about

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,060
Speaker 2:  the Nothing Phone two, but mostly talking about the tech business in general

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,620
Speaker 2:  and why it's So Hard to build great hardware. Then we are

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,020
Speaker 2:  going to finally get on the mics and hash out a debate that The Vergecast

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,940
Speaker 2:  team has been having for months. What makes a great TV remote

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,820
Speaker 2:  and which one is the best one? All that's coming up in just a second. But

32
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,700
Speaker 2:  first I gotta run upstairs and find my U S BBC to H D M I cable

33
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,940
Speaker 2:  because I always bring that with me in case, I don't know, I guess I need

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,740
Speaker 2:  to connect my computer to my TV and do a slideshow or

35
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,660
Speaker 2:  something. I realize now this is insane, but this is the life I've

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,820
Speaker 2:  chosen. This is The Verge cast. We'll be right back.

37
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,810
Speaker 3:  You've probably heard about the job of an intimacy coordinator,

38
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,090
Speaker 3:  but do you know what they actually do?

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,210
Speaker 4:  And every intimacy coordinator's kid is gonna be some form of mint of really,

40
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,330
Speaker 4:  I think most of the time Wait. Oh, a hundred percent, huh? Then we add in

41
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,810
Speaker 4:  the full retro Listerine breath strip, which is crucial

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,730
Speaker 3:  Several years into the era of the intimacy coordinator.

43
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,890
Speaker 3:  We ask what they've changed for the better in Hollywood

44
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,690
Speaker 3:  and what still needs work. This week on Intuit

45
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,810
Speaker 3:  Vultures Pop Culture podcast

46
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,870
Speaker 5:  On criminal, we bring you true crime stories told by

47
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,340
Speaker 5:  people who know them best.

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,500
Speaker 6:  We didn't believe in setting fires cause that was too dangerous. We were,

49
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,260
Speaker 6:  you know, a kind, a gentler kind of crooks, so to speak.

50
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,060
Speaker 5:  So the best plan you had was that you'd LaSow it?

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,860
Speaker 7:  Yes. Never imagined I'd use it for a camel.

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,100
Speaker 5:  I'm Phoebe Judge and this is criminal. Did you have to say

53
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,140
Speaker 5:  what was in the box,

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,100
Speaker 9:  Phoebe? We told lies,

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,820
Speaker 5:  Listen to criminal every week, wherever you get your podcasts.

56
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,430
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Everything's charging. All my cables are packed. I'm

57
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,950
Speaker 2:  gonna crush this vacation. So we are already

58
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,950
Speaker 2:  in the thick of phone season. It's mid-July and it is just coming

59
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,870
Speaker 2:  fast. Google launched the pixel fold the other week. Samsung has new

60
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,950
Speaker 2:  foldables and flippable coming later this month. We're gonna get new stuff

61
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,790
Speaker 2:  from Apple in September. The new Zen phone is pretty good. It's

62
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,590
Speaker 2:  all happening really fast. But one of the most interesting phones of the

63
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,670
Speaker 2:  year to me is the Nothing Phone two.

64
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,830
Speaker 10:  Introducing phone two, meet the Glyph interface,

65
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,910
Speaker 10:  a more thoughtful way to interact with a smartphone where lights on the

66
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,830
Speaker 10:  back of your device tell you all you need to know. Nothing

67
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,670
Speaker 2:  Is one of the few startups, true startups, trying to make it

68
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,310
Speaker 2:  in the phone business and has been doing some pretty interesting stuff over

69
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,630
Speaker 2:  the last couple of years. The verges, Allison Johnson reviewed the phone

70
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,390
Speaker 2:  too. I'll link to it in the show notes. It's a great review and her takeaway

71
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,150
Speaker 2:  was essentially that it's a good phone with some strong opinions

72
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,070
Speaker 2:  about how phones should work and how you feel about those opinions.

73
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,870
Speaker 2:  Like a monochrome UI and that light up interface on the back that

74
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,270
Speaker 2:  can alert you when your phone is face down and nothing's cool,

75
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,230
Speaker 2:  transparent design language, all that stuff will determine

76
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,830
Speaker 2:  how you feel about the phone. Otherwise it's just a good phone. And actually

77
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,030
Speaker 2:  that's the kind of stuff I want to talk about today. Nothing specifically

78
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,830
Speaker 2:  at CEO Carl Pay has spent the last couple of years running around

79
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,710
Speaker 2:  talking about how tech is boring and the world needs more exciting

80
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,390
Speaker 2:  tech companies and how nothing is going to bring back the glory days of

81
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,030
Speaker 2:  gadgets and then it makes the pretty good smartphone.

82
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,350
Speaker 2:  I just have trouble squaring those two things sometimes. So right

83
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,310
Speaker 2:  around the launch of the phone too, I brought Carl into the studio to talk

84
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,150
Speaker 2:  about nothing in the company, the phone too. His thoughts on everything from

85
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,070
Speaker 2:  gadgets to AI to AR glasses and what it really takes to

86
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,470
Speaker 2:  make it in the phone biz. I thought it was fascinating. So let's get into

87
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:28,550
Speaker 2:  it.

88
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,230
Speaker 2:  Carl, pay Welcome to The. Vergecast.

89
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,070
Speaker 8:  Thanks for having me.

90
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,910
Speaker 2:  You've been trying to do this forever.

91
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,910
Speaker 8:  Yeah, we, this is very exciting. We said seven years, right?

92
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,590
Speaker 2:  Yeah, God, several lifetimes ago

93
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,630
Speaker 8:  At this point. Lifetimes ago.

94
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,270
Speaker 2:  So you just launched a phone. Congrats.

95
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,230
Speaker 8:  Thank you. You're, you're

96
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,990
Speaker 2:  Like at the end of true chaos hopefully of launching

97
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,270
Speaker 8:  A phone. There's still a lot of work. Yeah. In the next couple of weeks,

98
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,670
Speaker 8:  but yeah, at least we've, we've launched the phone now. That's

99
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,660
Speaker 2:  Good. And I. Wanna get into that? We both have the phone phone sitting here

100
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,780
Speaker 2:  and we're gonna talk about it a little bit. Yours looks more like a storm

101
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,780
Speaker 2:  trooper than mine, which is very cool. But you've never been on the show.

102
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,380
Speaker 2:  And, I wanna talk about nothing as a thing and sort of you, you launched

103
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,660
Speaker 2:  this company a few years ago with this like big grand theory about the state

104
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,420
Speaker 2:  of technology. And, I have lots of questions about it. I guess maybe the

105
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,700
Speaker 2:  easiest place to start is just like I, I've sort of heard this mantra in

106
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,220
Speaker 2:  a bunch of different forms, but how do you talk about it now? Like what did,

107
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,420
Speaker 2:  what does nothing exist to do?

108
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,860
Speaker 8:  We're trying to make tech more fun again because I think a lot of people

109
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,020
Speaker 8:  can resonate with this, but personally, when I was young, I was super excited

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,780
Speaker 8:  about tech. I felt really inspired both on the hardware side and the software

111
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,180
Speaker 8:  side. When I was younger, apple used to have these epic product launches

112
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,220
Speaker 8:  that I grew up in Europe, so I had to stay up over the

113
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,180
Speaker 8:  night to watch and it was worth it because each product was such a big leap

114
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,580
Speaker 8:  forward compared to the last one. And you just made you feel like everything

115
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,460
Speaker 8:  was heading towards a really exciting trajectory. And it was also the time

116
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,340
Speaker 8:  where a lot of these social media and consumer

117
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,380
Speaker 8:  internet companies were being created. So you had a lot of innovation on

118
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,500
Speaker 8:  hardware but also a lot of innovation on software and and services. So

119
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,420
Speaker 8:  it felt like back then, you know, 10 years ago, society as a whole was way

120
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,820
Speaker 8:  more optimistic about where technology was going. But in the last couple

121
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,220
Speaker 8:  of years that sentiment, at least for me, has

122
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,540
Speaker 8:  pretty much disappeared. And when when we speak to other people, be it consumers

123
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,900
Speaker 8:  or investors, I think it kind of resonates. So

124
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,980
Speaker 8:  we're thinking like how can we kind of get back to that

125
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,420
Speaker 8:  original state where things just felt like it was getting better and better

126
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,580
Speaker 8:  and hopefully also inspire others to, to be a part

127
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,900
Speaker 8:  of this journey, be it our community or even our competitors. So I guess

128
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,860
Speaker 8:  that's why we, we started this.

129
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,180
Speaker 2:  I like the theory of that a lot. And I think that change you're

130
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,180
Speaker 2:  describing is something we talk about a lot on this show. And I think there

131
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,020
Speaker 2:  are sort of two responses I have to that idea and one

132
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,180
Speaker 2:  is that I think one thing that has happened in the last 10 years is that

133
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,620
Speaker 2:  all those things became super successful to the point where now like

134
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,740
Speaker 2:  most people's smartphones are not exciting, right? Like they're appliances,

135
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,420
Speaker 2:  And, I think to some extent that's fine. Like they do a lot of things really

136
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,220
Speaker 2:  well. They're very successful. But we, we got past the point of

137
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,180
Speaker 2:  being really excited about every single spec upgrade because they don't matter

138
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,500
Speaker 2:  that much.

139
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,620
Speaker 8:  The marginal utility is not that high.

140
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,260
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I think you can, you can have interesting debates about whether

141
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,260
Speaker 2:  that is a total lack of imagination and innovation or it's just the fact

142
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,060
Speaker 2:  that everybody got phones, we all got used to them and that's fine. And like

143
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,100
Speaker 2:  our phones fridges or washing machines now, like it

144
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,220
Speaker 2:  maybe. And then I think the other thing that happened is a lot of that stuff

145
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,620
Speaker 2:  we were really optimistic about turned out to have huge problems. Some of

146
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,500
Speaker 2:  which we should have known going in, some of which we didn't know going in,

147
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,580
Speaker 2:  but like we've been talking a lot about this with Instagram threads. This

148
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,900
Speaker 2:  like beautiful world we used to live in where you could just like talk to

149
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,380
Speaker 2:  all your friends on Facebook before. We all knew all of the costs that came

150
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,100
Speaker 2:  from that. And so part of what I wonder And I suspect you spend time

151
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,940
Speaker 2:  thinking about is like, is that era of how we

152
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,780
Speaker 2:  felt about technology ever gonna come back? Or do we just know things now?

153
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,540
Speaker 2:  We didn't then. And our experience of it has sort of changed that forever.

154
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,700
Speaker 8:  I don't think anything is forever And I if, I think if you zoom out and look

155
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,420
Speaker 8:  at history, history kind of ebbs and flows. Sure. So I think

156
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,140
Speaker 8:  there will be kind of periods in history where technology doesn't advance

157
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,900
Speaker 8:  that much and there will be other periods where a lot, a lot is happening.

158
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,700
Speaker 8:  I think we're in one of those slow periods. But what you said, if you look

159
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,300
Speaker 8:  at it from the company's perspective, I think a lot of innovation happened

160
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,100
Speaker 8:  when there were many small and medium sized companies trying to compete

161
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,820
Speaker 8:  with each other. And I think one of the reasons why we feel like

162
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,180
Speaker 8:  innovation has slowed down is because a lot of these companies have won already.

163
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,140
Speaker 8:  They become really big, they have, you know, very defined business model,

164
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,820
Speaker 8:  very defined type of consumer and it works. So

165
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,860
Speaker 8:  why, why risk it with something new At the same time? It feels like they've

166
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,620
Speaker 8:  all created really strong moats. So it's really hard for a new entrant to,

167
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,500
Speaker 8:  to get in. you know, we talked about the fact that we're launching our second

168
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,060
Speaker 8:  phone. There's a bunch of people that try to make smartphones in the last

169
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,180
Speaker 8:  10 years who never got got around to launching their, their second phone

170
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,420
Speaker 8:  or

171
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,260
Speaker 2:  Even their first phone in a lot of cases. Yeah. I have a lot of prototypes

172
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,500
Speaker 2:  that never hit the market sitting in my basement somewhere.

173
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,220
Speaker 8:  So, so the, the barrier to entry is, is just way too high for, for smaller

174
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,820
Speaker 8:  companies to come in? I think so. I think that from the company side, that's

175
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,300
Speaker 8:  kinda what we're seeing. you know, these small companies got really big and

176
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,100
Speaker 8:  they built these moats. I think we're probably one of the only smaller companies

177
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,820
Speaker 8:  that are that's able to experiment and, you know, try our own ideas

178
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,660
Speaker 8:  because we have accumulated the right type of resource

179
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,580
Speaker 8:  competence to at least give it an honest shot.

180
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,460
Speaker 2:  That's fair. And I think to some extent, I would imagine coming out of

181
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,740
Speaker 2:  what you were doing at OnePlus, which is like a, a small thing inside of

182
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,060
Speaker 2:  a large company with lots of infrastructure and lots of, you know,

183
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,700
Speaker 2:  backing resources. You were sort of a, a startup without

184
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,140
Speaker 2:  all the like scary cliffs of being a startup in a lot of ways. Then

185
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,860
Speaker 2:  you should just show up on your own and you're like, okay, now it's, it's

186
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,580
Speaker 2:  just like me and a dream. Yeah. And I I was in in

187
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,580
Speaker 2:  preparing for this was like listening to other interviews and stuff that

188
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,540
Speaker 2:  you've done and you've basically talked about just like walking into factories

189
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,140
Speaker 2:  being like, please, please build my phone. And all these companies are like,

190
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,660
Speaker 2:  we've built other people's phones and they died and those companies went

191
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,180
Speaker 2:  outta business and like there are a million failed, really good

192
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,980
Speaker 2:  Kickstarter ideas out there. Are you sure you're not just like totally insane

193
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,780
Speaker 2:  to try this? Is there a possibility that you are

194
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,620
Speaker 8:  I think we underestimated how hard it would be. Okay. Maybe that was a good

195
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,580
Speaker 8:  thing. We're kind of like you said, in more of a protected environment coming

196
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,740
Speaker 8:  out in the real world. It's a lot more difficult when we are approaching

197
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,060
Speaker 8:  the factories in the beginning, as you say, they, they, a lot of them have

198
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,020
Speaker 8:  been burned before by other entrepreneurs even more with more resources

199
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,020
Speaker 8:  than, than us. And the factories got a lot smarter now because before the

200
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,900
Speaker 8:  factory took all the risk. So they would procure all the components and

201
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,180
Speaker 8:  they would make everything. And if the entrepreneur or the company couldn't

202
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,820
Speaker 8:  sell the product, the factory would be sitting on everything. But with us,

203
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,220
Speaker 8:  when they eventually agreed to work with us, which they didn't in the beginning,

204
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,620
Speaker 8:  we had to pay everything not even upfront, but months in advance

205
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,060
Speaker 8:  of getting the product. So it got much harder from a funding perspective

206
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,660
Speaker 8:  and a cashflow perspective for us compared to the guys before because the,

207
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,060
Speaker 8:  the SU supply chain had just lost so much money with these other

208
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,180
Speaker 8:  startups in the past.

209
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,940
Speaker 2:  And in thinking about like how do we push all this stuff into the future,

210
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,940
Speaker 2:  I feel like there's a version of nothing where you tried to do something

211
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,980
Speaker 2:  super different and you ended up doing like what Humane is

212
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,420
Speaker 2:  doing with the, the AI pin or what Snap did with spectacles a bunch of years

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,500
Speaker 2:  ago and you're like, we think we know what's next and we're gonna, we're

214
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,220
Speaker 2:  gonna try to build it in public and get everybody really excited and move

215
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Speaker 2:  everybody into the future. You decided to go with

216
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,460
Speaker 2:  headphones and smartphones, which I think you could argue are

217
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,420
Speaker 2:  two of the most like mature mainstream hard to

218
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,260
Speaker 2:  crack markets that exist. Yeah. Why if, if the goal is like

219
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,780
Speaker 2:  make technology exciting again, why build those things?

220
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,100
Speaker 8:  I think you have to exist to be able to make

221
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,540
Speaker 8:  things more exciting. I think of it as kind of like the Apple analogy.

222
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,940
Speaker 8:  So Apple started with computers, but computers is not what made

223
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,660
Speaker 8:  Apple really big. The iPod was what made Apple really big and then they had

224
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,340
Speaker 8:  successes with iPhone and other products after that. I think our

225
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,420
Speaker 8:  entry into the smartphone industry is similar to Apple's entry into the computer

226
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,580
Speaker 8:  industry. It's a mature market through being different, we can find

227
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,100
Speaker 8:  our group of consumers and eventually build a business that is self-sustaining.

228
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,780
Speaker 8:  We can make some profits and then we can take those profits and

229
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,860
Speaker 8:  reinvest those into imagining what a future form factor could be.

230
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,020
Speaker 8:  I think we need that iPod moment in the future as well. But if we

231
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,500
Speaker 8:  started with that really crazy idea, what if it didn't have product market

232
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,580
Speaker 8:  fit then you know, we don't have an opportunity to try and create

233
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
Speaker 8:  the future anymore. Yeah.

234
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,060
Speaker 2:  I mean, it's an interesting analogy, right? Cuz I do think the computer market

235
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,540
Speaker 2:  was substantially less mature in the seventies when Apple came

236
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,420
Speaker 2:  in than the smartphone market is now. Which I think just like kind of makes

237
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,340
Speaker 2:  that road for you even harder in a lot of ways. It's like there

238
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,900
Speaker 2:  was no sort of apple of the computer industry at that time. But the thing

239
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,780
Speaker 2:  that's interesting is like, I think about sort of what is, what is at the

240
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,620
Speaker 2:  point right now that the MP3 market was when the iPod came

241
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,940
Speaker 2:  out and it's like there really isn't one, I kind of feel like the closest

242
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,860
Speaker 2:  thing is maybe headsets in the sense that like some exist but it's

243
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,420
Speaker 2:  pretty clear that nothing has gotten it right. But I also think we're like

244
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,540
Speaker 2:  several massive technical breakthroughs from being able to make, you know,

245
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,660
Speaker 2:  the iPod of headsets or whatever. I don't think the Vision pro is that thing.

246
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,420
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And so it's, it's just sort of a tricky moment where it, it does feel

247
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,140
Speaker 2:  like your only options are things we're totally not ready for

248
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,060
Speaker 2:  or things that may be kind of at the other side of the curve of being super,

249
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,220
Speaker 2:  super exciting to everybody.

250
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,420
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think our strategy is to start with really mature categories

251
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,780
Speaker 8:  that are big. So for smartphones, over a billion are sold every year for

252
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,380
Speaker 8:  wireless headphones. Over 300 million are sold every year and try and be

253
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,100
Speaker 8:  different there. At least carve out a niche for ourselves and then gradually

254
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,660
Speaker 8:  take it step by step to a more, more innovative

255
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,660
Speaker 8:  part of the curve.

256
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,020
Speaker 2:  So You don't have to win the phone market, you just have to get enough of

257
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,940
Speaker 2:  the phone market to put yourself in a position to win the next thing.

258
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,580
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think, you know, apple in the computer industry, although Dynamics

259
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,380
Speaker 8:  were not exactly the same, but today there's still kind of not a dominating

260
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,060
Speaker 8:  player in terms of market share. I don't think that we're gonna be a dominating

261
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,820
Speaker 8:  player if we're around in 10 years in smartphones. I think the, the p

262
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,620
Speaker 8:  like the turning point will be a new form factor definitely. Is it glasses?

263
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,060
Speaker 8:  You know, I've been thinking a lot about software. I think

264
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,460
Speaker 8:  a lot of the smartest people they went out to making apps. So in

265
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,940
Speaker 8:  2008 the app store was invented. I think that was like the major,

266
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,940
Speaker 8:  the last major innovation in mobile os before the app store,

267
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,900
Speaker 8:  whatever features you got with the phone were the features you had throughout

268
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,100
Speaker 8:  the entire lifecycle. Unless you sideloaded something after the app store,

269
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,740
Speaker 8:  you could basically extend your phone with infinite capability. Like whatever

270
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,340
Speaker 8:  other people could dream up, you could download, right? So I think a lot

271
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,900
Speaker 8:  of the smart people, they went on to making apps around 2008

272
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,260
Speaker 8:  and then it got to a point where people were just optimizing for time spent

273
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,020
Speaker 8:  or trying to make whatever metric was important to them. And, I think the,

274
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,540
Speaker 8:  the major platforms like app apps were there. They were bought into this

275
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,700
Speaker 8:  because whenever the app developers make money they also make money.

276
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,620
Speaker 8:  So I think there's a vested interest in not doing that much on the, on the

277
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,540
Speaker 8:  mobile OS side. Maybe that's where we, you know, should be exploring

278
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,300
Speaker 8:  what what could be done. Okay. Like one of the things we've done with the

279
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,180
Speaker 8:  phone too is we feel like apps have gotten too powerful. Like,

280
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,460
Speaker 8:  you know, sometimes I know I have to do something on my phone work related.

281
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,940
Speaker 8:  So I unlock my phone, I go into TikTok or Instagram, I

282
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,820
Speaker 8:  scroll for, I just wanted to scroll for like one minute to see what's, what's

283
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,380
Speaker 8:  new, what notifications are important. But I actually just end up scrolling

284
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,340
Speaker 8:  for five minutes and then I forgot what, what my original task was. Yep.

285
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,580
Speaker 8:  So we feel like apps have gotten too powerful and with the phone

286
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,380
Speaker 8:  too, both on the hardware side with the cliff but also on the software side,

287
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,180
Speaker 8:  we're trying to at least give users options to take

288
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,140
Speaker 8:  some of that power back.

289
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,460
Speaker 2:  I mean now you're just bringing up my like pet favorite thing to talk about.

290
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,300
Speaker 2:  I've been obsessed with this world of these like slightly dumber smartphones

291
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,100
Speaker 2:  for forever. The the light phone and there was the the punk a few years ago

292
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,300
Speaker 2:  and this idea about like what if you had a phone that did all the things

293
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,220
Speaker 2:  you needed it to but didn't take over your entire life. Which I think

294
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,020
Speaker 2:  is a really good thing. And I think a lot of people intellectually want that,

295
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,500
Speaker 2:  but I think figuring out how to make the case for what amounts to like a

296
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,380
Speaker 2:  slightly worse smartphone is really complicated.

297
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,580
Speaker 8:  It it is. And

298
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,380
Speaker 2:  You're better at marketing in this space than most And I think even for you

299
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,460
Speaker 2:  that story is gonna be hard to tell. Like we are going to make it harder

300
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,740
Speaker 2:  for you to find the Instagram icon because that's good for you. Yeah. And

301
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,300
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. And. I just, I don't know how to get over that bridge.

302
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,180
Speaker 8:  I think it's going against human nature Yeah. Is really difficult

303
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,580
Speaker 2:  And tens of thousands of engineers who have spent the last decade building

304
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,220
Speaker 2:  really, really good apps that I am sort of drawn to spend hours in

305
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,500
Speaker 8:  All day. Yeah. So I think we gotta start with a niche. I think there's a

306
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,820
Speaker 8:  certain type of consumer out there who's, who really resonates with features

307
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,540
Speaker 8:  like this. It's really gonna be hard to convince the mass to adopt something

308
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,140
Speaker 8:  like this. It's hard to go against human nature. Like we're hardwired to

309
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,300
Speaker 8:  want to use things that are addictive. So I think it's,

310
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,780
Speaker 8:  it's, it's one step but it's not gonna take us to the, to the mainstream.

311
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,660
Speaker 8:  Definitely. Yeah,

312
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,620
Speaker 2:  That's fair. So tell me about the phone too. So by the time this comes out

313
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,460
Speaker 2:  the reviews will be out, a lot of folks will have seen it, but I think based

314
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,660
Speaker 2:  on kind of what I've heard and what you said in the launch and stuff, you,

315
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,580
Speaker 2:  you learned a lot from the phone. One, building phones is hard. You,

316
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,140
Speaker 2:  you got better at it, you got a better team. You've like convinced some of

317
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,980
Speaker 2:  these partners that you're actually doing this for real and you're not just

318
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,140
Speaker 2:  gonna leave them in the lurch with a bunch of unused product and you're in

319
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,620
Speaker 2:  a position where you can like push a little harder towards the stuff you

320
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,300
Speaker 2:  wanna do. So when you look at the phone too, where does that most

321
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,540
Speaker 2:  show up? What is the like you're like this is now the stuff we're able to

322
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,700
Speaker 2:  do because we're better at this now.

323
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,660
Speaker 8:  So if you look at the hardware design or the hardware side, we

324
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,140
Speaker 8:  had the Cliff interface with the phone one. We got a lot of negative feedback

325
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,860
Speaker 8:  on the, from comments on the internet saying it's like a gimmick. Okay it's

326
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,500
Speaker 8:  just a nice phone with some funky lights on the back, but it's not really

327
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,900
Speaker 8:  useful. It wasn't that we didn't have those ideas of how to make it useful

328
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,820
Speaker 8:  and what features it should have. We just didn't have the engineering capability

329
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,780
Speaker 8:  to deliver all of that. So now with the phone too, on

330
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,740
Speaker 8:  the glyph interface side, there's a whole lot of features. There's a timer,

331
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,420
Speaker 8:  there's a progress bar. So when you're like waiting for your food delivery

332
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,260
Speaker 8:  or waiting for a Uber, you can see where it is. We created a

333
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,740
Speaker 8:  Glyph composer so you can have fun and kind of create your own gly segment,

334
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,620
Speaker 8:  share with your friends. And we're working with artists like Swedish House

335
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,420
Speaker 8:  Mafia to make sound packs. Nice. Yeah. So it's just more fun. So

336
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,820
Speaker 8:  a lot more on the utility but a lot more fun as well.

337
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,860
Speaker 2:  That reminds me of, I don't know even know if this is still a thing, but

338
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,740
Speaker 2:  for a while you could customize the vibration patterns on certain phones

339
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,100
Speaker 2:  so that like if you had an in your pocket and it was like, oh if my wife

340
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,460
Speaker 2:  is calling it does sort of three quick pulses and if it's anybody else it's

341
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,140
Speaker 2:  like too long. Pulses. Yeah, And, I. Remember spending so much time trying

342
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,820
Speaker 2:  to dial that in only to discover that I could never get it quite right and

343
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,500
Speaker 2:  could never remember what was what. But I feel like the gly thing kind of

344
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,380
Speaker 2:  vibes with me

345
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,620
Speaker 8:  In that. Yeah, I think we should simplify it. Right? So now we also introduce

346
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,340
Speaker 8:  something we call essential glyphs. So for things that are really

347
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,860
Speaker 8:  essential for you, it's just always on. It doesn't flash and go away.

348
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,060
Speaker 8:  So you could assign this one to somebody important as an example. So I think

349
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,860
Speaker 8:  that's easier to, to recognize than some vibration or, or

350
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,860
Speaker 8:  a light that flashes in and disappears. So the hardware side, I think

351
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,620
Speaker 8:  Cliff is a lot more useful. I know that the creativity within

352
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,620
Speaker 8:  our company cannot be compared to the creativity of the entire internet.

353
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,740
Speaker 8:  So we're creating SDK for this interface. Other app developers can also

354
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,340
Speaker 8:  tap in and, and it'll be exciting to see what they build with this.

355
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,420
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I, I noticed in using it there's definitely like, you can tell the

356
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,940
Speaker 2:  team is bigger, there's just more stuff going on on the phone than there

357
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,580
Speaker 2:  was before. It feels like you've, you've touched more of the menus, you've

358
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,380
Speaker 2:  touched more of the icons, there's more going on kind of in the nothing os

359
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,740
Speaker 2:  people built new widgets. It's just like there was just yeah, human power

360
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,820
Speaker 2:  to build some of this stuff. But it does make me wonder not to keep going

361
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,660
Speaker 2:  back to the Apple analogy, but like the thing Apple did very

362
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,500
Speaker 2:  early on that worked out really, really well for Apple was basically try

363
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,340
Speaker 2:  to own as much of the thing as it possibly could. And you're in a position

364
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,340
Speaker 2:  with smartphones where that's very hard. Like building your own Os right

365
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,460
Speaker 2:  now is is suicide. Yeah. Like it just, it just is if you, if you weren't

366
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,020
Speaker 2:  running Android, people would be like, that's stupid and just move on to

367
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,580
Speaker 2:  their last, they need

368
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:13,740
Speaker 8:  Apps,

369
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,820
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah. And and so you're in this position where there is at some

370
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,740
Speaker 2:  point sort of a wall on how much you can do. I would think in part because

371
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,860
Speaker 2:  apps are made to run on specific kinds of devices with specific size

372
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,820
Speaker 2:  screens with specific kinds of resolutions. Like how far do you feel

373
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,660
Speaker 2:  like you can push in the smartphone world before you either like lose

374
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,500
Speaker 2:  users or just build something nobody wants?

375
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,820
Speaker 8:  I think taking a step-by-step approach and reacting to user feedback for

376
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,020
Speaker 8:  every generation we could probably do something really interesting. Okay.

377
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,060
Speaker 8:  And wait for that leapfrog moment. You mentioned that it's

378
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,420
Speaker 8:  our hands are kind of tied right on multiple fronts and even within

379
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,220
Speaker 8:  Android, if you look at the market share globally, but in particular in the

380
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,220
Speaker 8:  US like iOS is creeping up year on year. I think today

381
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,940
Speaker 8:  is already in general population of the US it's like

382
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,900
Speaker 8:  55%. Yeah. iOS already

383
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,420
Speaker 2:  And climbing pretty fast and

384
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,460
Speaker 8:  Climbing. Yeah. And for people under 18 it's like 90%. So what happens

385
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,100
Speaker 8:  when these people grow up I mean is Android still gonna be around? So that's

386
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,340
Speaker 8:  something that, you know, really worries us, us as well. Like if we're able

387
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,860
Speaker 8:  to be successful with the next few generations of products. But at the same

388
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,740
Speaker 8:  time, if the door for Android is, is slowly closing, then what do

389
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,540
Speaker 8:  we have to build a company on? Right?

390
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,300
Speaker 2:  So, but the thing I take away from that is like, I, I swear the whole reason

391
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,060
Speaker 2:  for the iOS thing is just blue bubbles. Like it's just, it's just blue bubbles

392
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,140
Speaker 2:  and it's like there there are people out there who it's like, you know, what's

393
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,140
Speaker 2:  the, what's the biggest turnoff in a possible dating partner in people like

394
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,140
Speaker 2:  Green Bubbles? Yeah. And it's like that is like objectively insane. But this

395
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,060
Speaker 2:  is the world we live in. Are there blue bubbly things you feel like you

396
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,900
Speaker 2:  can do in this space without being sort of the

397
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,420
Speaker 2:  dominant player? Like if I'm, yeah, if you're, if you're running Samsung,

398
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,580
Speaker 2:  you have some moves right there, you can, you can start to sort of enclose

399
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,780
Speaker 2:  the ecosystem in some interesting ways. You're too small to do that right

400
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,300
Speaker 2:  now in a way that would sort of blow up. Maybe that changes over time. But

401
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,980
Speaker 2:  are there, do you have moves like that?

402
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,460
Speaker 8:  My view on this is that, you know, apple, they used to really compete on

403
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,700
Speaker 8:  making the best product, the best user experience, the best software, the

404
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,620
Speaker 8:  best hardware, the best interplay between hardware and software. But today

405
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,500
Speaker 8:  they build so many moats that are beyond that, right? So they don't have

406
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,060
Speaker 8:  to compete as hard on pure product cuz they have these blue bubble

407
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,620
Speaker 8:  moats and ultimately that's gonna be really bad for the

408
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,620
Speaker 8:  consumer because there's just gonna be fewer and fewer options. If you look

409
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,620
Speaker 8:  at our industry, there's fewer and fewer brands over time it's getting more

410
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,940
Speaker 8:  and more consolidated and Apple is slowly gaining market share every single

411
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,860
Speaker 8:  year. So I think ultimately the only way around this

412
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,540
Speaker 8:  is, is, is if the government steps in, and I've seen in Europe that things

413
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,420
Speaker 8:  are already happening with a USB C standard. But also I think

414
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,940
Speaker 8:  next year the protocol iMessage has to be opened up in Europe

415
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,020
Speaker 8:  based on my understanding. But I'm not sure how they're gonna phase it. And,

416
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,700
Speaker 8:  I'm sure Apple is gonna try and make it difficult. That's,

417
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,460
Speaker 2:  That's gonna get messier before it gets better I

418
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,460
Speaker 8:  Think. I think so as well. So what can we do? We can't wait. Okay. We can

419
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,580
Speaker 8:  communicate on, on kind of how, how unfair the some of the practices are

420
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,460
Speaker 8:  and how it's really hard to break in and innovate in this market. We can

421
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,380
Speaker 8:  probably not I mean if we build our own social features, it's probably not

422
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,060
Speaker 8:  gonna do that much, right? Cuz we're, our user base is still quite

423
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,020
Speaker 8:  small. Maybe we can do some really naughty stuff like reverse

424
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,460
Speaker 8:  engineer iMessage and Yeah. And have support on our

425
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,420
Speaker 2:  Phones. Sure. I mean, but even that, it's sort of an interesting thing to

426
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,300
Speaker 2:  think about how to sequence, right? Because if you wait until you're huge

427
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,180
Speaker 2:  to build that stuff, you've kind of missed a chance to bring people

428
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,260
Speaker 2:  along with you. But if you do it at the beginning, it's gonna be so

429
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,020
Speaker 2:  sort of limited in its utility. But I just think about like, I

430
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,060
Speaker 2:  mostly use an iPhone and my wife mostly uses a Pixel and there's just a

431
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,100
Speaker 2:  series of things that are more annoying in our relationship as a result.

432
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,620
Speaker 2:  And so I'm at a point now where it's like one of us is gonna switch phones

433
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,820
Speaker 2:  because it's just gonna make life easier for us to like send each other pictures

434
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,580
Speaker 2:  airdrop, right? Because trying to send pictures between devices is awful

435
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,940
Speaker 2:  when you're on different platforms.

436
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,820
Speaker 8:  So what, what do you guys do now? Email or

437
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,980
Speaker 2:  She just texts me everything. Links and the, the videos come in like tiny

438
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,700
Speaker 2:  little postage stamps. I mean it's bad, it's a crappy system. We have shared

439
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,140
Speaker 2:  Google photos albums that kind of work. It's just not good is the point.

440
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,860
Speaker 2:  And so I think for me it's like okay if I go out and buy

441
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,500
Speaker 2:  us the same thing, if I'm buying two nothing

442
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,500
Speaker 2:  phones, should that be better than if she has a Pixel And? I have a

443
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:27,940
Speaker 2:  Nothing Phone

444
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,420
Speaker 8:  Today it's probably the same. Okay. Android is also building interoperability

445
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,860
Speaker 8:  between Android devices. So instead of Airdrop, Android has something called

446
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,140
Speaker 8:  nearby share. Right? It works in a similar way. I don't think it's the right

447
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,020
Speaker 8:  time yet to make the experience between nothing devices way better than nothing

448
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,540
Speaker 8:  and other Android devices. Okay,

449
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,220
Speaker 2:  That's fair. I think that's probably right. And it does seem like Android

450
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,860
Speaker 2:  has at least gotten better enough in that regard that you're not,

451
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,100
Speaker 2:  you're not missing. There's

452
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,660
Speaker 8:  Too, too much.

453
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,140
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The iOS to Android dinner play sucks really bad. Yeah. But with things

454
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,380
Speaker 2:  like RCS and nearby share and that kind of stuff, it seems like the blue

455
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,860
Speaker 2:  bubbles of Android at least are coming along a little bit.

456
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,860
Speaker 8:  I don't think it's enough. Okay. It's not stopping the market share increase

457
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,300
Speaker 8:  or the market share decrease. Right? So it's something that's kind of worrying

458
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,380
Speaker 8:  but you know, hopefully some, something good happens. What

459
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,260
Speaker 2:  Do you make of that? Like the looking at the fact that especially in the

460
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,140
Speaker 2:  US the iPhone is just dominant. Like what, what's the takeaway

461
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,020
Speaker 2:  there? Is it just that Apple is better at marketing this than everybody?

462
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,340
Speaker 8:  I think Apple had the best product and now that they built the

463
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,940
Speaker 8:  moats, they can focus less on innovating on the product. They can just

464
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,220
Speaker 8:  keep defending their their pie. So that's my take. So if we want innovation

465
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,940
Speaker 8:  to speed up, again, somebody has to do something about all these modes

466
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,700
Speaker 8:  because like messaging is almost like infrastructure. Like how can you

467
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,340
Speaker 8:  give monopoly to one company? File sharing is kind of like

468
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,100
Speaker 8:  basic in infrastructure. Would you give water system or

469
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,820
Speaker 8:  plum like water, plumbing and electricity to one company? I don't know. But

470
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,300
Speaker 8:  that's kind of what's what's happening.

471
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,140
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Do you buy that hardware can kind of lead that cuz I think a lot of

472
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,980
Speaker 2:  it also is, I think the app ecosystem on iOS is pretty

473
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,700
Speaker 2:  definitively better than on Android. But I think, like I remember talking

474
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,140
Speaker 2:  to the Pixel team years ago when they were starting the Pixel and one of

475
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,660
Speaker 2:  the things that they said is we need to make what we believe is like a truly

476
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,860
Speaker 2:  terrific Android device to make developers excited to build stuff for this

477
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,540
Speaker 2:  device. And I think to some extent that has worked and that's what they've

478
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,500
Speaker 2:  tried to do with Chromebooks. That's what they've tried to do with tablets

479
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,060
Speaker 2:  and kind of to, you know, mixed effect on some of those. But you've been

480
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,740
Speaker 2:  in this business a long time. Do you buy the idea that like if you make really

481
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,820
Speaker 2:  great hardware, you can get people to kind of wanna be part of it? I guess

482
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,100
Speaker 2:  the, the same question goes for like the glyph interface

483
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,020
Speaker 8:  I think with scale. Okay, great hardware and a lot of scale because the app

484
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,780
Speaker 8:  developers, they're, a lot of them are also businesses. So they have to figure

485
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,020
Speaker 8:  out the roi. If I invest engineering resource, am I gonna make the money

486
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,740
Speaker 8:  back or not? So it's easier when you have scale. I think we're lucky because

487
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,980
Speaker 8:  we have a very, cause we're quite small, so we have a very enthusiastic community.

488
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,140
Speaker 8:  They're very technical. So there'll be a lot of kind of hacking going on

489
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,740
Speaker 8:  once we're released. Sdk, maybe something interesting comes out of that.

490
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,820
Speaker 8:  Yeah. But I don't expect the, the metas or you know, the largest

491
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,780
Speaker 8:  tech companies in the world to use our glyph SDK

492
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,100
Speaker 2:  Is the only way to do that. To just, if volume eventually gets so big, they

493
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,260
Speaker 2:  can't ignore you. That's the only move.

494
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,220
Speaker 8:  That's the only way. Okay. I think

495
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,300
Speaker 2:  You don't think you can like sneak one into, into Adam ER's office

496
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,620
Speaker 2:  and be like, hey, here's a, here's a cool thing that might work for Instagram

497
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:18,900
Speaker 2:  just to

498
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,020
Speaker 8:  Get him off. I think he might really love the product, but it still doesn't

499
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,340
Speaker 8:  make sense for him to commit resources to, to doing anything at this moment

500
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,740
Speaker 8:  unless it can can really benefit his product somehow.

501
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,540
Speaker 2:  That's fair. I I can understand that Adam build it. If you're listening,

502
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,060
Speaker 2:  I don't know what it would do, but every time you get an Instagram, just

503
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,820
Speaker 2:  cliffs everywhere. All right, we're gonna take a break, but we have

504
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,540
Speaker 2:  lots more to talk about including what comes after phones. We'll be right

505
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:41,740
Speaker 2:  back.

506
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,790
Speaker 11:  Unexplainable has got a new two-part series we're calling the black box.

507
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,070
Speaker 11:  It's all about the mysterious hole at the center of modern artificial intelligence.

508
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,870
Speaker 12:  I've built these models, I've studied these models, we just don't understand

509
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,590
Speaker 12:  what's going on here.

510
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,590
Speaker 11:  Even the experts don't really know how these systems work or what they can

511
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:02,750
Speaker 11:  do

512
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,590
Speaker 12:  If we open up PGE or a system like it. You just see

513
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,630
Speaker 12:  millions of numbers flipping around and we just have no

514
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,630
Speaker 12:  idea what any of it means.

515
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,470
Speaker 13:  We are rushing at breakneck speed towards

516
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,710
Speaker 13:  more and more advanced forms of ai.

517
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,750
Speaker 14:  You know, when I see something that is well beyond my understanding,

518
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,590
Speaker 14:  I'm scared. And that was something well beyond my understanding.

519
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:29,630
Speaker 11:  I'm know I'm hassenfeld, but this isn't my voice and it hasn't been the

520
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,350
Speaker 11:  whole time. It's just an AI made that sounds sort of like me. An

521
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,070
Speaker 11:  unexplainable new series starts July 12th, wherever you get your podcast.

522
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,770
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back with Carl. Pay the CEO of nothing. Talk to me about

523
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,570
Speaker 2:  price, cuz I think this is something you've been through now at a couple

524
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,530
Speaker 2:  of different companies trying to figure out how do I sell good stuff at the

525
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,210
Speaker 2:  lowest possible price. And you're kind of doing the same thing you did at

526
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,010
Speaker 2:  One Plus, which is like one of the things that most impressed people about

527
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,530
Speaker 2:  the phone one was how cheap it was. And I think with this next one, the phone

528
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,610
Speaker 2:  is, seems to be significantly better but also significantly more expensive.

529
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,090
Speaker 2:  It's gone from 3 99 to 5 99. Yeah. How do you balance

530
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,690
Speaker 2:  making a phone at the, at the cheapest possible price with trying to do

531
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,010
Speaker 2:  all this other stuff you're trying to do?

532
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,290
Speaker 8:  It's quite complicated. We can't just think about what consumers are gonna

533
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,690
Speaker 8:  think, although consumers are the most important ones. We also have to think

534
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,570
Speaker 8:  about the suppliers because our industry doesn't really support

535
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,730
Speaker 8:  small companies. It just costs like 30 to 50 million

536
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,370
Speaker 8:  for each new product we develop. Wow. So if we sell one

537
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,370
Speaker 8:  unit, it's still that amount of money. If we sell a million units, it's still

538
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,130
Speaker 8:  that amount of money. Right? So we just have to reach scale and it also,

539
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,210
Speaker 8:  it's quite, quite costly for our factories and our suppliers to work with

540
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,090
Speaker 8:  us. So unless they feel like we can become a big company one day, it

541
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,050
Speaker 8:  doesn't make sense to, to collaborate. So in the beginning

542
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,890
Speaker 8:  with the phone one, we had to sacrifice and make it a

543
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,530
Speaker 8:  loss leader just to get to some level of volume that's enticing for,

544
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,290
Speaker 8:  for supply chain to wanna work with us.

545
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,450
Speaker 2:  So at that point, it's actually more useful to be sort of cool and

546
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,490
Speaker 2:  zeitgeisty than it is to be per unit profitable in, in that first

547
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:15,730
Speaker 2:  run.

548
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,290
Speaker 8:  We need to get the volumes up. Sure. That's, that's like the key. Okay. So,

549
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,490
Speaker 8:  but as a company we can't keep making a loss on everything we sell. Sure.

550
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,770
Speaker 8:  So over time we have to become profitable and we,

551
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,850
Speaker 2:  We should've just made the phone 50 bucks you would've sold a ton of them

552
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,130
Speaker 2:  would've

553
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,090
Speaker 8:  Been great. Exactly. And would've been bankrupt by now. So it's

554
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,010
Speaker 8:  about finding the right balance. So with the phone two, we're not losing

555
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,890
Speaker 8:  money on every device sold. We're making a small margin, but after all

556
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,690
Speaker 8:  the costs this year, we're still gonna be lose quite a bit of money.

557
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,010
Speaker 8:  But we have to make that step so that, you know, eventually maybe next year

558
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,890
Speaker 8:  or the year after we can break even The economy right now is not the best.

559
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,130
Speaker 8:  So funding, although it's available, it's much harder than before.

560
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,050
Speaker 8:  So we gotta try and run a more, get to profitability quicker than

561
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,330
Speaker 8:  before.

562
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,970
Speaker 2:  Okay. I have no evidence for this and it's possible, I'm totally wrong. And

563
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,930
Speaker 2:  I. Hope you tell me if I am. But it seems to me that especially in the US,

564
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,690
Speaker 2:  $600 is kind of an awkward price for a phone. Yeah. Like I, I

565
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,490
Speaker 2:  almost think it's easier in some ways to make the case for like an eight

566
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,210
Speaker 2:  or $900 phone than it is for a $600 phone. Because

567
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,170
Speaker 2:  especially in the US where people are paying it off over the course of a

568
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,090
Speaker 2:  couple of years, it's, it's a couple of dollars a month people don't really

569
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,810
Speaker 2:  notice. But then if you say, okay, I can buy the iPhone for a thousand dollars,

570
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,930
Speaker 2:  right? That is just sort of the, the assumed price of a very good phone.

571
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,650
Speaker 2:  You come in and say, no, we've made a very good phone for $600 and there's

572
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,090
Speaker 2:  just a thing that lodges in people's brains that's like, well what's the

573
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,690
Speaker 2:  catch And I think? Right? If it's like, yeah, if it's $200, I understand

574
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,860
Speaker 2:  that I'm making trade offs and I'm clearly a a cost conscious person, but

575
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,780
Speaker 2:  you get to this middle ground, And, I think lots of companies have found

576
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,540
Speaker 2:  this in the US that the price sensitivity is really different here.

577
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,260
Speaker 2:  And so it's like at some point if you're gonna ca if you're gonna charge

578
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,220
Speaker 2:  $600, you might as well just charge $900.

579
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,100
Speaker 8:  The market is like a barbell shaped. Yeah. So you got a lot of volume

580
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,660
Speaker 8:  at the low end and a lot of volume at the high end. But I think that's like

581
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,860
Speaker 8:  when you're looking at the market as a whole, like the general market in

582
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,540
Speaker 8:  the US looks like that. However, we're not catering to the general market

583
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,300
Speaker 8:  today. We're not even available for sale inside of the carrier stores. Sure.

584
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,540
Speaker 8:  I think the first step to our entrance into the US

585
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,740
Speaker 8:  is we gotta target to the tech enthusiasts

586
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,260
Speaker 2:  Who are even less price sensitive. These are the people who are out there

587
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,620
Speaker 2:  buying $1,800 crappy foldable phones.

588
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,620
Speaker 8:  I think a lot of them actually look at what you get and what you pay. Okay.

589
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,980
Speaker 8:  And can be really smart about that. So at least that group of people are

590
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,660
Speaker 8:  gonna be, I think it's gonna, this phone is gonna speak to them. I think

591
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,980
Speaker 8:  us is really, really complicated as a market. We gotta take a step-by-step

592
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:42,020
Speaker 8:  approach, start by building a loyal fan base, people really knowledgeable

593
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,460
Speaker 8:  with people, really know knowledgeable about technology, have their endorsement

594
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,260
Speaker 8:  first, you know, collaborate with them to make the product really, really

595
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,180
Speaker 8:  good before we go to the next step. you know, us is, it's

596
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,820
Speaker 8:  like one of the freest economies in the world, but actually our industry

597
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,580
Speaker 8:  in the US it's one of the most difficult ones.

598
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,460
Speaker 2:  Oh, it's a disaster to

599
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,260
Speaker 8:  Break into. Yeah. Like the barrier to entry is so high. There's basically

600
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,020
Speaker 8:  only three sales channels. Right? The three carriers, the three big carriers.

601
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,620
Speaker 8:  And it just makes it a lot more complicated than compared to other markets

602
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,380
Speaker 8:  where everything is unlocked. When, when everything is unlocked, you can

603
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,740
Speaker 8:  just speak to the consumer and as long as you have a great product and a

604
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,460
Speaker 8:  and a a brand that consumers love, that's all you need to worry about. But

605
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,420
Speaker 8:  here it's, it's it's way more complicated.

606
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,540
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean that sort of mid-range phone graveyard is

607
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,500
Speaker 2:  littered with phones who thought they could crack unlocked phones in the

608
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,740
Speaker 2:  US Yeah. And they just were all wrong. It's really hard to do.

609
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,220
Speaker 8:  And then you see the market share for iPhone keep increasing as well. Yeah,

610
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,540
Speaker 2:  Exactly. Yeah. People like walk into stores and say, what should I buy? And

611
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,140
Speaker 2:  they say, here's the new version of your old phone. Yeah. And that's in the

612
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,260
Speaker 2:  US especially, that just is what happens. so like I had a, I had a Samsung

613
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:48,300
Speaker 2:  phone or I had an iPhone and you use your phone

614
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,740
Speaker 2:  until it dies, then you upgrade it to whatever the newest one of those things

615
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,900
Speaker 2:  is. And breaking that chain

616
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,820
Speaker 2:  strikes me as maybe the hardest challenge of breaking into the us

617
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,940
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I've spoken to carriers in the us it's not that we can't be

618
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,220
Speaker 8:  arranged, but I think it's just not the right timing. But something that

619
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,820
Speaker 8:  came out of those conversations was that they're also really worried about

620
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,500
Speaker 8:  the situation because they're seeing, you know, after these

621
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,220
Speaker 8:  big launches, they would measure the footfall into their stores and now the

622
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,420
Speaker 8:  footfall is getting less and less ing after the launches because there's

623
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,900
Speaker 8:  not much new to, to go and check out in person anymore. Yeah.

624
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,100
Speaker 2:  I mean that tracks I mean. We even see that covering these things like the,

625
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,860
Speaker 2:  the sort of day of enthusiasm for one of these new devices is definitely

626
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,060
Speaker 2:  not what it once was.

627
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,660
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So hopefully we can do something about it, but it'll it'll take a bit

628
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,300
Speaker 8:  of time. Yeah,

629
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,500
Speaker 2:  That's fair. So, and speaking of that, actually, one of the things I've heard

630
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,420
Speaker 2:  you talk a bunch about is thinking about how to do all this stuff over

631
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,580
Speaker 2:  time. Right? You, you clearly have a long roadmap. You didn't answer my question

632
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,180
Speaker 2:  about glasses, so I'm gonna make you answer my question about glasses here

633
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,100
Speaker 2:  at some point. But you also are in a position of You

634
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,380
Speaker 2:  don't have unlimited money. You're not a trillion dollar company that can

635
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,540
Speaker 2:  just pour money into the metaverse until it becomes a thing.

636
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,300
Speaker 2:  You have a a small number of shots at this in a pretty real way.

637
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,700
Speaker 2:  Like I've talked to a lot of companies over the year who are like, we we

638
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,580
Speaker 2:  got one hardware order wrong because it didn't launch

639
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,460
Speaker 2:  to as much excitement as we hoped and it bankrupted the company and that

640
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,660
Speaker 2:  was it. Yeah. We ended up with a warehouse full of phones and no company.

641
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,940
Speaker 2:  How do you square those two things? You're like, okay, this is the thing

642
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,420
Speaker 2:  that gets us to the thing. We want to be big, we have this long

643
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,740
Speaker 2:  roadmap, but we also have to keep being an ongoing

644
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,780
Speaker 2:  concern. Yeah. To get there.

645
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,180
Speaker 8:  Yeah. You got kind of have to have a dream, but you have to be very practical

646
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,140
Speaker 8:  and reaching it. I think this business is one of the most challenging ones

647
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,580
Speaker 8:  to build because there's just so many things you gotta think about. You gotta

648
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,940
Speaker 8:  think about everything from supply chain to manufacturing to

649
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,540
Speaker 8:  hardware engineering, software engineering, hardware design, software design,

650
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,060
Speaker 8:  sales, marketing, distribution around the world. It's different in every

651
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,780
Speaker 8:  country. Marketing is different in every country then

652
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,220
Speaker 8:  supporting the products, software updates and you know, fixing,

653
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,660
Speaker 8:  repairing the products when they're broken. So the chain, the, you know,

654
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,940
Speaker 8:  the value chain is just so long compared to if we're just making an app

655
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,860
Speaker 8:  Right. It'll be much, much simpler. Sure. So I think,

656
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,500
Speaker 2:  Or the reverse, like the one of the companies that I know you've thought

657
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,780
Speaker 2:  about in, in building this company is Tesla, And, I. Think the smart thing

658
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,700
Speaker 2:  Tesla did was say our first car is gonna cost $250,000. We're not gonna

659
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,900
Speaker 2:  sell very many of them, but we're gonna make a bunch of money on the ones

660
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,460
Speaker 2:  that we do sell. And that's gonna start to pay as we kind of trickle down.

661
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,380
Speaker 2:  So for you that, I don't know, you, you could have started with like a, a

662
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,140
Speaker 2:  foldable phone that cost $2,000 and some people would've bought it, some

663
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,180
Speaker 2:  people would've not bought it, and then you can sort of slowly scale up.

664
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,140
Speaker 2:  But you, you tried to do kind of the, a small version of the mainstream

665
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,740
Speaker 2:  thing. Yeah. From the very beginning.

666
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,060
Speaker 8:  I thought about the Tesla model, but I think Tesla was so ahead of its time

667
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,940
Speaker 8:  against their competitors. That's fair. Yeah. To make an electric vehicle,

668
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,420
Speaker 8:  a foldable phone does not have the same headstart as

669
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:47,740
Speaker 8:  as

670
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,140
Speaker 2:  That's fair. You would've had to launch that in like 2012 and then you would've,

671
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,380
Speaker 2:  you

672
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,260
Speaker 8:  Would've had, and also the utility of electric car is so easy to understand

673
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,220
Speaker 8:  versus a foldable phone. I think that's fair. So maybe when we,

674
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,220
Speaker 8:  you know, go to our iPod moment, that's where we start from the high end.

675
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:03,900
Speaker 8:  I don't know.

676
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,220
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, I I that's, that's fair. And I think, I just think that pace is

677
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,300
Speaker 2:  really interesting and we've seen so many companies, like Snap has been going

678
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,780
Speaker 2:  through this in a big way where they, they started the spectacles. They're

679
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,420
Speaker 2:  like, here's the road to true augmented reality. We think we're gonna get

680
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,380
Speaker 2:  there. And that road has gotten weirder and longer than anybody expected

681
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,340
Speaker 2:  and has been really hard for that company. And Meta is going through the

682
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,180
Speaker 2:  same thing with Oculus, like that's getting better, but not as quickly as

683
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,220
Speaker 2:  we would hope. Apple's having trouble with Division Pro. It's like these

684
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,620
Speaker 2:  roads are long and complicated and those are companies, those are like public

685
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,420
Speaker 2:  companies with billions of dollars to lose on this problem. It's

686
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,500
Speaker 8:  A cliche, but I I mean timing is key. So we're trying to do the right thing

687
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,180
Speaker 8:  at the right time. Yeah. And, and have a more patient approach.

688
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,860
Speaker 2:  So speaking of that, what do you look at right now? It feels like we're in

689
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,060
Speaker 2:  this crazy moment of change. All anybody talks about is ai,

690
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,420
Speaker 2:  wearables are like kind of a thing. Glasses are becoming the thing.

691
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,620
Speaker 2:  Like what's, what do you make of the transition we're in right

692
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,260
Speaker 8:  Now? I think for us, like at where we are, we are,

693
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,340
Speaker 8:  what's really important is to get to profitability. If we don't, then there's

694
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,740
Speaker 8:  a risk, again,

695
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,740
Speaker 2:  You're talking like a big company here. Like we have to be fiscally responsible

696
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,980
Speaker 8:  Because we, if we are not profitable then we don't have the opportunity to

697
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,340
Speaker 8:  build the next thing. And that that's, that's a reality. Yeah. A lot of these

698
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,300
Speaker 8:  big companies, they have a lot of free cash flow like Google and Face and

699
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,860
Speaker 8:  Meta. They make a lot of money on ads so they can use that business to kind

700
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,300
Speaker 8:  of subsidize or take, take larger risks elsewhere. We don't have that. So

701
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,700
Speaker 8:  we need to make sure we're at least safe and we survive and then we can figure

702
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,940
Speaker 8:  out the, the really interesting products. Is

703
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,860
Speaker 2:  That hard for you as the CEO to move sort of deliberately

704
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,540
Speaker 2:  in that sense? Because I would think also if you're sitting there thinking

705
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,500
Speaker 2:  like, okay we, here is the, the thing that is going to make

706
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,380
Speaker 2:  us the company we want to be, to not just

707
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,860
Speaker 2:  pour everything into racing there as quickly as you possibly could and actually

708
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,780
Speaker 2:  be sort of methodical on the way. Seems like it would be a really hard thing

709
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,740
Speaker 2:  to stay disciplined about over

710
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,780
Speaker 8:  Time. There's no other option. I mean it's like a, a game with no other,

711
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,820
Speaker 8:  other path. So I think it's, it's quite easy to, to be on this

712
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,060
Speaker 8:  path apart from reaching profitability, I think it's really important to

713
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,180
Speaker 8:  build a really solid team and really solid processes so we can run

714
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,900
Speaker 8:  like clockwork for when that opportunity comes. We'll be much more,

715
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,780
Speaker 8:  it'll be much easier for us to capture the opportunity. It's like during

716
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,860
Speaker 8:  winter let's train our body to be really strong so that when summer comes,

717
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Speaker 8:  when spring, when spring comes, we can run really quickly.

718
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,300
Speaker 2:  So do you think the phone keeps being the thing for a long time? Both for

719
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,780
Speaker 2:  you and kind of for the world?

720
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Speaker 8:  I think so, yeah.

721
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,780
Speaker 2:  Like if you fast forward out five years from now, is the phone still the,

722
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,380
Speaker 2:  the primary thing that everybody has with them all the time.

723
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,540
Speaker 8:  A computing device made up of a large screen with some camera capability

724
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,260
Speaker 8:  I think is gonna be the dominating form factor for Okay. A long time

725
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,500
Speaker 8:  people have said voice might be taking over or kind of

726
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,980
Speaker 8:  immersion into virtual reality. But I, I think those are more like

727
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,100
Speaker 8:  in addition to the main form factor, you can't get the

728
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,700
Speaker 8:  same level of utility through just audio or it, it

729
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,620
Speaker 8:  doesn't feel that good to always be in a virtual environment. So

730
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,580
Speaker 8:  I think this form factor will be really key. But I think maybe what happens

731
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,980
Speaker 8:  on the OS side and the software side could change with all the

732
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,900
Speaker 8:  improvements we're seeing in AI today.

733
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,900
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What does that look like do you think as, as you cast out a few years?

734
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,260
Speaker 2:  I think the thing I keep hearing is basically like how do we take your phone,

735
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,300
Speaker 2:  how of being kind of an app machine, right? That all your

736
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,780
Speaker 2:  device does is provide a bunch of icons that you tap on to go into sort of

737
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,740
Speaker 2:  individual worlds that are apps and how do we kind of stitch it all back

738
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,460
Speaker 2:  together in a way that makes more sense And that's what like Alexa and Google

739
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,620
Speaker 2:  Assistant were supposed to be. That's what everybody's talking about with

740
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,900
Speaker 2:  the AI chatbots. Is that where you think we're headed or do you see something

741
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,340
Speaker 8:  Else? I think so. I think there's not a lot of dumb people. I think everybody

742
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,340
Speaker 8:  sees a similar kind of long-term vision but everybody might have

743
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,300
Speaker 8:  a different solution or how hypothesis on how to get there.

744
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,260
Speaker 8:  If we take one step back and just think about what it means to be a tech

745
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,100
Speaker 8:  company, I think we need to either, not just our company but

746
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,180
Speaker 8:  the tech company community. We either have to enable

747
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,620
Speaker 8:  consumers to do something they weren't able to do before or we, we need to

748
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,580
Speaker 8:  enable them to do it. Something they can already do, but much faster or much

749
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,180
Speaker 8:  cheaper. So I think that's, those are the guiding principles for how we evolve

750
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,100
Speaker 8:  the OS as well. Like okay, it's an app machine right now. It's an app

751
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,300
Speaker 8:  launcher that actually hasn't changed since the Symbian days, right? Yeah.

752
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,140
Speaker 8:  Symbian was also home screen or lock screen with, with a bunch of apps that

753
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,100
Speaker 8:  you open. It took up the entire screen, you went back to home screen and

754
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,940
Speaker 8:  launched something else. So I think if you want to remove that metaphor,

755
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,100
Speaker 8:  you need to create a new metaphor that's way more efficient than before and

756
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,700
Speaker 8:  easy to understand and easy to use.

757
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,780
Speaker 2:  Do you have a theory about what that metaphor looks like? Is it just a text

758
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,300
Speaker 2:  box? Like is the chat g p t bot how

759
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,060
Speaker 8:  You do everything? I think some, some text, not all text. Probably some

760
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,140
Speaker 8:  buttons because writing is still slower than just pressing something

761
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,420
Speaker 8:  and some augmentation via, via voice. I think it needs

762
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,540
Speaker 8:  to slowly augment away the apps. Like

763
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,740
Speaker 8:  today we're using some really simple apps like mindless scrolling apps, right?

764
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,580
Speaker 8:  What if we wanted to accomplish more complicated tasks like 3D modeling or

765
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,660
Speaker 8:  photo editing or I don't know what, what other use case there might be.

766
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,900
Speaker 8:  It's actually quite difficult to learn how to use these new apps, but maybe

767
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,700
Speaker 8:  we can just tell the phone what we need to do and it would use those apps

768
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,500
Speaker 8:  for us without the apps even being visible in the foreground. I think that

769
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,340
Speaker 8:  could be like enough utility to transition to a new

770
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:27,740
Speaker 8:  metaphor.

771
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:31,980
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean that is like my favorite sort of UI game to

772
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,420
Speaker 2:  play. It's the, it's the plane ticket example, right? Like I need to go to

773
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,100
Speaker 2:  San Francisco. And I would like to buy a plane ticket to get to San Francisco.

774
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,300
Speaker 2:  It turns out that doing like a back and forth with a voice assistant to do

775
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,220
Speaker 2:  that is terrible. Doing a a back and forth with the chatbot is

776
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,660
Speaker 2:  terrible. But also the way we have it now where I'm in six apps, I'm comparing

777
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,460
Speaker 2:  a bunch of different things. Like also terrible. So this question of like

778
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,940
Speaker 2:  what is actually a better structure for doing something like that

779
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,660
Speaker 2:  feels like sort of the next big question of the next, you know, five

780
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,860
Speaker 2:  years and there's a million versions of that, right? Yeah. Where it's like

781
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,940
Speaker 2:  I just wanna, I wanna find something to watch on my TV or I wanna book

782
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,740
Speaker 2:  a reservation to go to dinner. These things that we've all learned how to

783
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,540
Speaker 2:  do in these really specific, not that good ways we have to invent

784
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,540
Speaker 2:  something better for and like the underlying tech is getting there, but the

785
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,020
Speaker 2:  products don't seem to have quite solved it yet.

786
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,740
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think everybody sees what the future needs to be, but I think the

787
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,860
Speaker 8:  trick really tricky part is finding the right user interface that's easy

788
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,740
Speaker 8:  to understand and can get adoption from consumers. you know, as we

789
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,700
Speaker 8:  scale our these products into the hands of millions of consumers, we also

790
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,420
Speaker 8:  have a shot at implementing our version to see if it sticks or not.

791
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,820
Speaker 8:  But who knows, right? Cuz the, I don't think it's the underlying technology

792
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,900
Speaker 8:  that's gonna be the most challenging part because it's maturing. It's gonna

793
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,820
Speaker 8:  be the, the right user interface.

794
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,460
Speaker 2:  I have two more questions then I'm gonna let you go. The first is, one of

795
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,260
Speaker 2:  the things that has happened is that this sort of transparent design

796
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,380
Speaker 2:  that you guys have bet really big on is starting to percolate out

797
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,580
Speaker 2:  there. Like Beats has a pair of headphones that looks suspiciously like somebody

798
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,580
Speaker 2:  at Apple got ahold of the nothing headphones and made those for, but

799
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,540
Speaker 2:  for Beats. The, the transparent look is you guys didn't invent it, but

800
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,980
Speaker 2:  I think it, it restarted a bit as nothing started to come out. You're gonna

801
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,900
Speaker 2:  be in a position where like any good startup, there are these big companies

802
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,100
Speaker 2:  that have infinite resources and are gonna copy every cool thing you do

803
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,500
Speaker 2:  really fast. How do you stay out in front of that?

804
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,180
Speaker 8:  I think Apple won't I mean big companies won't really copy

805
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,180
Speaker 8:  us because they already have a much more mass market

806
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,740
Speaker 8:  consumer base. By copying us, they actually limit the amount of users that

807
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,740
Speaker 8:  they can potentially talk to. Cuz our design is more niche.

808
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,700
Speaker 2:  But at the, on the flip side, they have a hundred thousand engineers and

809
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,380
Speaker 2:  they can just throw a thousand of them at any specific problem for a small

810
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:46,580
Speaker 2:  number of

811
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,220
Speaker 8:  People and, and they can use their sub-brands like what you just mentioned,

812
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,060
Speaker 8:  to do something more niche. Sure. But actually also committing to creating

813
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,580
Speaker 8:  something transparent is actually, it's a lot of work. I don't know if you've

814
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,260
Speaker 8:  seen some of my tweets on how we accomplished this design. I mean it's very

815
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:03,300
Speaker 8:  easy to make the glue look very ugly

816
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,660
Speaker 8:  because everything is visible now. It's very easy in the manufacturing process

817
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,380
Speaker 8:  for there to be dust. So it actually adds a lot to our costs

818
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,100
Speaker 8:  of making the product transparent. I don't think it's something that

819
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,820
Speaker 8:  like these big companies with a lot of resource, of course they can do it,

820
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,820
Speaker 8:  but I don't know if the economics make sense for them to increase the cost

821
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,260
Speaker 8:  of all their products just to make it look a little bit different. I think

822
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:30,180
Speaker 8:  it's a good strategy for us because we need to find our niche and wedge

823
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,060
Speaker 8:  ourselves into the market. So I'm not that worried about other people

824
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,820
Speaker 8:  copying. Also, if our, if our vision is to make tech fun again,

825
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,940
Speaker 8:  if we can inspire other people to do more interesting things, that it's still

826
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,580
Speaker 8:  okay. However, if they go straight for some of the user

827
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:49,420
Speaker 8:  interfaces that we create, like for me, I see the Cliff interface as

828
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,020
Speaker 8:  a UI that we're trying to create. I think that's when we're gonna start defending

829
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:53,900
Speaker 8:  ourselves. Okay.

830
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,020
Speaker 2:  So do you think about it that ruthlessly in thinking about products,

831
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,780
Speaker 2:  like is is one of the sort of check boxes for new products, is this

832
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,140
Speaker 2:  something that these big companies can't or won't do?

833
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,900
Speaker 8:  I don't think we're, that we weren't that kind of structured about,

834
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,900
Speaker 8:  about this. It just happened. But we realized throughout the process how

835
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,780
Speaker 8:  difficult it was to actually make these products, which kind of alleviated

836
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,660
Speaker 8:  our worry that people would aggressively go after this.

837
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,860
Speaker 2:  Okay. All right. So last thing and then I'll let you go. The phone two is

838
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:27,540
Speaker 2:  I think in a lot of ways a much better phone one. Is that the right

839
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:30,460
Speaker 2:  path to be on in this space where you're trying to sort of build something

840
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,540
Speaker 2:  like just keep getting a little better every year? Or do you think there

841
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,820
Speaker 2:  is room for you in this industry to try something

842
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,020
Speaker 2:  wildly different and new?

843
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,060
Speaker 8:  I think both. I think if you keep getting a little bit better every half

844
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,860
Speaker 8:  a year or every year, it really compounds. Right? So you,

845
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,180
Speaker 8:  you end up like maybe,

846
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,860
Speaker 2:  I don't know, I think, I think Apple would say that's what they've been doing

847
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,820
Speaker 2:  for the last decade and then you show up saying everybody's super boring

848
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,660
Speaker 2:  cause they all just get 10% better every year.

849
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,060
Speaker 8:  I don't know. I I feel like this, the changes between the phone one and

850
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,820
Speaker 8:  phone two and how different it is, is a lot bigger than

851
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,380
Speaker 8:  some of these bigger companies. Okay.

852
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,380
Speaker 2:  Like, gimme an example of what, what on there feels,

853
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,820
Speaker 8:  I think the, the software looks completely different as an example. So when

854
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,620
Speaker 8:  we launched the phone one, we, we were only able to make stock Android

855
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,020
Speaker 8:  stable, right? That's the extent of our engineering resource. Now we can

856
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,020
Speaker 8:  start experimenting with our own ideas, our own widgets, our own

857
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,740
Speaker 8:  monochrome ui, et cetera. So I think at least that looks very different

858
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,900
Speaker 8:  and we have a very exciting roadmap for where to take that in the future.

859
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,020
Speaker 8:  So at least the next few generations or next couple of years, there'll be

860
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,820
Speaker 8:  a lot of exciting stuff happening on the software side.

861
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,180
Speaker 2:  What about on the hardware front? Is there a, I know you've, you've said

862
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,860
Speaker 2:  somewhat controversially. I read a thing this morning that said like, Carl

863
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,860
Speaker 2:  pays reality distortion field put Steve Jobs to shame. After you said

864
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,900
Speaker 2:  you're not into foldable phones as an idea. I'm very bullish on flip phones

865
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,500
Speaker 2:  personally. And, I'm happy to give you a long speech about why I love flip

866
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,100
Speaker 2:  phones if you'd like, but you have not seemed all that interested in that.

867
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,340
Speaker 2:  You're, you're still on this kind of like most people's experience of a smartphone.

868
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:03,020
Speaker 2:  What else can we add to it? Do you think there's big new ideas to be had

869
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,220
Speaker 2:  there?

870
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,740
Speaker 8:  The thing for us is every product needs to be profitable and every product

871
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,020
Speaker 8:  needs to be a hit because we don't have infinite resource. So

872
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,220
Speaker 8:  foldables and flip phones are not that exciting yet, over time as the

873
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,300
Speaker 8:  category matures, as the crease starts really disappearing as apps

874
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,580
Speaker 8:  are being tailored to this new form factor, I think, you

875
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,580
Speaker 8:  know, it's something we we could consider. We're not saying no, but I don't

876
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,180
Speaker 8:  think it's the thing that's gonna really change the paradigm. It's, I don't

877
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,740
Speaker 8:  think it's the thing that's gonna make Android win over iOS. I don't think

878
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,340
Speaker 8:  it's what's gonna make us go from a, a niche smartphone maker

879
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,420
Speaker 8:  to the next big tech company. So it's, it's okay. We

880
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:44,260
Speaker 8:  just gotta build a really solid base of products and we keep getting

881
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,740
Speaker 8:  better. Hopefully we build up some, some cash

882
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,700
Speaker 8:  to try and invent the next thing.

883
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:53,900
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. All right, well when either the next thing happens or the

884
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,020
Speaker 2:  phone three like flips and folds and you've just been lying to me this whole

885
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,820
Speaker 2:  time, you're gonna come back and we're gonna talk about it. Okay,

886
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,180
Speaker 8:  Sounds good.

887
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,300
Speaker 2:  Thank you Carl. Really appreciate it.

888
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:00,740
Speaker 8:  Thank you.

889
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,900
Speaker 2:  All right, one more break and then we are going to get deep into our feelings

890
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,780
Speaker 2:  about TV remote.

891
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:17,220
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Andru. Marino is is here. Andru, you have told me

892
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:21,020
Speaker 2:  very little about what's about to happen to me and to us in the

893
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,340
Speaker 2:  universe, except you told me you wanna talk about TV remotes.

894
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,420
Speaker 16:  Yeah. Yeah. We have a lot of opinions about TV remotes in this

895
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,860
Speaker 16:  Vergecast Producers club here. And I wanted to share

896
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,300
Speaker 16:  that discussion with the audience. Cause I think it's worth talking about.

897
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,260
Speaker 2:  I should say in preparation for this, I went around my house and found every

898
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,060
Speaker 2:  single remote that I have. It turns out there were seven, three of them.

899
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,620
Speaker 2:  I could not tell you what they go to, but I have four functioning remotes

900
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,460
Speaker 2:  and three others in my house. Liam James is also here. Liam who

901
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,340
Speaker 2:  usually refuses to be on the podcast, demanded to be on the podcast.

902
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,620
Speaker 16:  Well someone has to counter your terrible opinions on remote controls.

903
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,660
Speaker 2:  So I mean that's fair. We've been talking about this segment and this issue

904
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,060
Speaker 2:  for a very long time. This might be six or seven hours long. So buckle up

905
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,940
Speaker 2:  everybody. Andru you, you have been talking to some people and and

906
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,580
Speaker 2:  doing some research. Where would you like to start here?

907
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,980
Speaker 16:  Okay, I wanna start with one of the most frustrating remotes I've ever

908
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,820
Speaker 16:  used, which kind of started this conversation about how remote

909
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,860
Speaker 16:  design is kind of an afterthought. So I have this remote

910
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,900
Speaker 16:  and it is one of the novelty remotes cuz I needed a universal remote for

911
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,740
Speaker 16:  my tv. Okay. And it's shaped like a fishing reel.

912
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:36,540
Speaker 16:  What it looks like a fishing reel has a little like

913
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,700
Speaker 16:  crank on the side. Oh boy. So it actually works

914
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,140
Speaker 16:  with the remote and I'll get to that.

915
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,020
Speaker 2:  You know what this looks like to me is like an old timey like Nintendo video

916
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:49,700
Speaker 2:  game controller. Like you know the the gun that you had for duck hunt on

917
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,980
Speaker 2:  like the old Nintendo,

918
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,860
Speaker 16:  There's a Dreamcast fishing remote that is a like that.

919
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:55,220
Speaker 16:  Yeah,

920
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:55,580
Speaker 2:  Exactly.

921
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:59,780
Speaker 16:  It's shaped like a phish fishing reel. There's a skinny handle and

922
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,660
Speaker 16:  there's like a bulbus spool shaped end to it. The

923
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:07,580
Speaker 16:  first problem is there's absolutely no way to lay this flat on the table

924
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:11,300
Speaker 16:  because there's a little trigger on the back and if you lay it on the table

925
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,060
Speaker 16:  it just kind of goes to the side. Also there's a gigantic

926
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,860
Speaker 16:  button on the side of the remote that makes this very loud

927
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:19,300
Speaker 16:  noise.

928
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,620
Speaker 16:  Oh no like sounds like a fishing reel being yanked

929
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,900
Speaker 16:  pressing. This button also turns on the sounds for the remote

930
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,260
Speaker 16:  so I can be like I'm reeling it right now. Is

931
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,420
Speaker 16:  this marketed to children? It's this

932
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:39,340
Speaker 2:  Is marketed just to you Andru like this. I'm not convinced this is

933
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,380
Speaker 2:  a real product. This is something someone made and conned you into buying

934
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:42,900
Speaker 2:  on the internet.

935
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,980
Speaker 16:  It's probably like a Father's Day present kind of thing. So obviously

936
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,140
Speaker 16:  you don't want a knowing sound every time you use the remote. So you can

937
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,860
Speaker 16:  turn it off by pressing the button again, but if you put it on the couch

938
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:57,140
Speaker 16:  it's gonna hit that button again. It's really annoying. And then all

939
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,060
Speaker 16:  the other buttons are so tiny and hard to find. The volume up

940
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,900
Speaker 16:  button is like two little triangles on the left. The

941
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,020
Speaker 2:  Thing you're holding up looks like a slightly bigger like calculator. Watch

942
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:11,740
Speaker 2:  where all the buttons are the same and tiny and like God help you trying

943
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,060
Speaker 2:  to figure out what any of them are.

944
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,300
Speaker 16:  So obviously this is like a dramatic version of a bad remote

945
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,220
Speaker 16:  design but there are similar kind of problems with remotes.

946
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,940
Speaker 16:  Like my least favorite is that Comcast Silver remote?

947
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,220
Speaker 16:  This one? Oh yeah, David has it here.

948
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,260
Speaker 2:  This is one of the seven that I have in my house. I don't have a Comcast

949
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,500
Speaker 2:  box anymore but I have this remote which means there's like a 60% chance

950
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,300
Speaker 2:  I'm paying Comcast $10 a month for this remote at some point. But I

951
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,740
Speaker 2:  agree this is one of the all time worst remotes and it has the same problem

952
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,860
Speaker 2:  that you were just showing. It has a million buttons, they're all basically

953
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:49,620
Speaker 2:  the same. You can't find anything just like with your fingers. I agree. This

954
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,820
Speaker 2:  is like one of the worst remotes of all

955
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,740
Speaker 16:  Time. Yeah, this is one of the remotes that's like notorious for being taped

956
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,940
Speaker 16:  off for certain areas. so like you give to your grandparents, it's like

957
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:01,500
Speaker 16:  here are the three buttons you need to know use,

958
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,940
Speaker 17:  Do not touch the input button.

959
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:06,700
Speaker 2:  This remote, I'm sorry, I'm just now obsessed with this remote. I'm looking

960
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,580
Speaker 2:  at this remote now. It has five buttons just to control picture

961
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,620
Speaker 2:  and picture mode, which no one ever uses on their Comcast box. And

962
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,060
Speaker 2:  overwhelmingly their Comcast box probably doesn't support it has buttons,

963
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,820
Speaker 2:  marked guide, info, menu, exit help. And last

964
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:26,020
Speaker 2:  there's an A, B and C. Like what are we, what are we doing? This is out.

965
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,460
Speaker 2:  There are five buttons that you use to turn things on at the top of this.

966
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,780
Speaker 2:  This is, yeah, this just makes me angry to look at.

967
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,980
Speaker 16:  Right? So I wanted to know how did we get to this point? Why

968
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,060
Speaker 16:  are remotes so poorly designed? So the first person I talked

969
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,020
Speaker 16:  to was Steve Turk, he's a designer in Brooklyn.

970
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,980
Speaker 18:  One of the biggest things I've worked on is how to like explain to people,

971
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,940
Speaker 18:  normal people what design is.

972
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,220
Speaker 16:  He wrote this really great blog about the design of remote controls

973
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,180
Speaker 16:  and the different levels of Simplicity. He pointed out

974
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,180
Speaker 16:  the obvious reason why a lot of remotes are quote unquote bad.

975
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:01,660
Speaker 16:  The

976
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,980
Speaker 18:  Key thing about remotes is though, even though they're the most important

977
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,900
Speaker 18:  thing to the user, they're the last thing that the company thinks about

978
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,900
Speaker 18:  making and generally speaking they're trying to make them as cheaply as

979
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,500
Speaker 18:  possible. And so that often means using a bunch of stock remotes

980
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:17,900
Speaker 18:  that are kind of manufactured in a hundred different places and yet like

981
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,460
Speaker 18:  the actual, the thing that you hold in your hand for a good five to 10 years,

982
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,460
Speaker 18:  it doesn't seem to be that important. So I think it's more of a cultural

983
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,500
Speaker 18:  thing rather than an engineering problem.

984
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,220
Speaker 2:  I guess that's true. That also explains right why like your cable box looks

985
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,500
Speaker 2:  like crap. It's just not the thing people ultimately at the end of the day

986
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,380
Speaker 2:  care about. Yeah, but it's the least satisfying answer. It really is,

987
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,940
Speaker 2:  but it's probably right. That

988
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,740
Speaker 17:  Makes sense. But also, yeah requires me to accept that people

989
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,100
Speaker 17:  don't care about things that they should.

990
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:48,340
Speaker 16:  Yeah, exactly. So I talked to someone else who actually

991
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,180
Speaker 16:  has designed remotes, his name is Sajid. He worked on

992
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,180
Speaker 16:  the Phillips UX design.

993
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,140
Speaker 19:  The whole effort was called one UX, which is basically

994
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,300
Speaker 19:  one user experience across all of Philips products. Not only doing

995
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,380
Speaker 19:  the the digital interface designs, remote controls were are an

996
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:10,460
Speaker 19:  integral part of using a product like a television. So naturally it became

997
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,980
Speaker 19:  part of the process to take a look at the remote controls and

998
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:18,100
Speaker 19:  make that entire experience end-to-end experience more pleasant for our

999
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,380
Speaker 19:  users.

1000
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:22,420
Speaker 16:  Something immediately when I asked like why can't we just have like a simple

1001
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,900
Speaker 16:  remote design? He alluded to the

1002
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,660
Speaker 16:  obstacles and red tape and a lot of this kind of stuff.

1003
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:33,460
Speaker 19:  When you try to do something totally divergent and let's say okay, let's

1004
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,540
Speaker 19:  remove the buttons, let's introduce a track pad and then there will be a

1005
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,300
Speaker 19:  lot of pushback because that demands new engineering,

1006
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,740
Speaker 19:  new product in industrial design, new testing

1007
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,940
Speaker 19:  and there is skepticism around whether this will work or not. So you have

1008
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,780
Speaker 19:  to convince a lot of stakeholders to be able to adopt anything

1009
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,140
Speaker 19:  that's diverging from the traditional way of doing things.

1010
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,500
Speaker 16:  And this is kind of like an overall tech design problem, not

1011
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:03,900
Speaker 16:  specific to TV remotes. That's a reason why a lot of TVs look

1012
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,620
Speaker 16:  exactly the same and a lot of laptops and mice and and all that.

1013
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:08,140
Speaker 16:  Well And

1014
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,780
Speaker 2:  I think, I wonder if that also explains these kinds of, you know, every

1015
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:15,900
Speaker 2:  imaginable button and idea thing like this just made me think of for

1016
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,340
Speaker 2:  some reason I was talking to somebody years ago who was making an email app

1017
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,020
Speaker 2:  and they were like pull up gmail.com And, I'd like to tell you

1018
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:27,300
Speaker 2:  about the product manager for every single pixel on this website.

1019
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,900
Speaker 2:  And it's like there's a reason that there's something in this corner and

1020
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,980
Speaker 2:  there's a reason that there's something in this corner and on this sidebar

1021
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,300
Speaker 2:  and up here and there's a person who is in charge of all of this and they're

1022
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,180
Speaker 2:  sitting in meetings demanding that their thing be front and center. So ultimately

1023
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,900
Speaker 2:  they make everything front and center, which makes everything a total nightmare.

1024
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,900
Speaker 2:  And I'm sitting here looking at both this Comcast remote with a billion buttons

1025
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,980
Speaker 2:  and my old VIO remote which has a million buttons on one side and then a

1026
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,060
Speaker 2:  full keyboard on the back.

1027
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,340
Speaker 16:  Oh I love that one.

1028
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,820
Speaker 2:  I actually, to be honest, there's like something very good about this particular

1029
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,100
Speaker 2:  remote but you can just see it too, right? There's a million

1030
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:02,260
Speaker 2:  different products inside of this. Exactly. This one remote and they

1031
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,140
Speaker 2:  all just shove it all together because it seems easier than like having

1032
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,100
Speaker 2:  opinions about things.

1033
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:11,300
Speaker 16:  Yeah, both designers talked about this like over time there's been so

1034
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:14,860
Speaker 16:  many iterations of the TV

1035
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,340
Speaker 16:  remote controlling the DVD player, the home theater system,

1036
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,340
Speaker 16:  the vcr, your music devices, your computer,

1037
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,780
Speaker 19:  All of these interfaces that you're trying to control kind of are hidden

1038
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,820
Speaker 19:  behind something that you need to access and to access

1039
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,780
Speaker 19:  those is the remote control and that makes it, you need to expose all

1040
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,380
Speaker 19:  of those functions and features on the remote control so that you can have

1041
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,740
Speaker 19:  a one click access to them. Right? So then you add up adding buttons and

1042
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,180
Speaker 19:  functions

1043
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,220
Speaker 16:  So you can tell when there's not a lot of research and development being

1044
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,660
Speaker 16:  put into remote. So how would you test a good design

1045
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,020
Speaker 16:  is what I asked them. Mm. Steve had a lot of ideas on how we

1046
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:53,900
Speaker 16:  can get to that place.

1047
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,740
Speaker 18:  You have, every designer has a way that they think about doing it, but it

1048
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:01,100
Speaker 18:  turns out a lot of our ideas are not that great and so I'm more of a kind

1049
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,020
Speaker 18:  of user experience designer where you design stuff and then you test it

1050
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,900
Speaker 18:  and if, if your ego is strong enough to sit through like hundreds of people

1051
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,780
Speaker 18:  going through your device, you end up in a much better place.

1052
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,220
Speaker 16:  And that is what Sage's team ended up doing was

1053
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:19,220
Speaker 16:  testing out this stuff in people's homes versus them coming to

1054
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,580
Speaker 16:  a lab.

1055
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,740
Speaker 19:  That's the best way to kind of understand what you are designing is getting

1056
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,620
Speaker 19:  used in the real world. Like it could be somebody in their home

1057
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,180
Speaker 19:  trying to use a TV while attending a kid and

1058
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,780
Speaker 19:  something they are doing on the side. Like how do you juggle your

1059
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,700
Speaker 19:  day-to-day life around the products that you are de because your product

1060
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,380
Speaker 19:  is going and sitting inside their home, it's becoming part of their life.

1061
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:45,660
Speaker 2:  Well my question on that is how do they test this? Because I think part of

1062
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:49,420
Speaker 2:  the challenge here is that everybody is used to a giant slab full of

1063
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,220
Speaker 2:  buttons and there's something awful but something sort of familiar about

1064
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:57,180
Speaker 2:  that. So if you do have this like big divergent idea, how do you test

1065
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,140
Speaker 2:  to see if it's working? Like what, what are they looking for? What is, what

1066
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,700
Speaker 2:  does a better remote even look like?

1067
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:06,260
Speaker 16:  So the best scenario that people want, which I think kind of

1068
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,380
Speaker 16:  is a flaw in TV remotes, is everyone wants something to be like

1069
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,820
Speaker 16:  one click away.

1070
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,220
Speaker 19:  We have wanted to understand like what are some of those

1071
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:19,460
Speaker 19:  priorities for the users. Like most of them don't want to be looking

1072
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:23,340
Speaker 19:  down at the remote control while trying to experience the content

1073
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,940
Speaker 19:  they're trying to enjoy. One of the big insights was like

1074
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:31,140
Speaker 19:  make this a non interruptive process. Like remote control should not be

1075
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,540
Speaker 19:  interruptive to the experience of enjoying the content

1076
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,060
Speaker 19:  and at the same time it things should be one click away.

1077
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,300
Speaker 2:  Can I tell you my crazy theory? I wonder if the problem is that we

1078
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,100
Speaker 2:  conflate those two things that I can do it easily without looking

1079
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:49,900
Speaker 2:  down And. I have to be able to do it in one click. Yep are the same thing

1080
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,140
Speaker 2:  because they're not the same thing. Like for me it's all,

1081
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,460
Speaker 2:  every time I have to look down at my remote we have failed but I'm happy

1082
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,900
Speaker 2:  to like do two or three things as long as I kind of understand how to get

1083
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,620
Speaker 2:  there quickly and don't have to look down. I am much

1084
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:07,780
Speaker 2:  more in favor of like if I had to like do the kmi code every time

1085
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,700
Speaker 2:  to do something but I like knew it and didn't have to look it up every single

1086
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,540
Speaker 2:  time, that still feels like a victory to me. But maybe I'm not all people.

1087
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:18,140
Speaker 16:  Yeah, I I mean I'm pretty satisfied with like the Netflix button and the

1088
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:22,100
Speaker 16:  Hulu button. It's like multiple streaming service buttons and on one remote

1089
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,980
Speaker 16:  fair that's I mean that works for me. But what Sage's team ended up

1090
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,860
Speaker 16:  going with is kind of more, I don't wanna say minimalist but like

1091
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,500
Speaker 16:  a smaller design with just like focusing on a track pad.

1092
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,900
Speaker 19:  It is like a smaller in size. The track pad was like the major

1093
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,820
Speaker 19:  portion of the design and the interface. So track pad can be just

1094
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:45,380
Speaker 19:  a track pad but then track pad can be with clickable areas. So we had like

1095
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,420
Speaker 19:  top right top bottom left and right edges of the track

1096
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:53,300
Speaker 19:  pad as clickable so you could do multiple interactions And then we

1097
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:57,460
Speaker 19:  also, because we had to do incorporate so much into one track pad, so we

1098
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:01,300
Speaker 19:  said okay, how can we increase more functions within a track

1099
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,140
Speaker 19:  pad? So you have a single click, you have a long press, you have a long

1100
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,740
Speaker 19:  press and a slide. So we kind of use all those gestures to

1101
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,900
Speaker 19:  increase the amount of things that you can do with just a square

1102
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:12,460
Speaker 19:  surface.

1103
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,140
Speaker 16:  I saw Liam really shaking his head. This is, this is my

1104
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,100
Speaker 16:  biggest frustration

1105
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,860
Speaker 17:  With modern remotes. you know I completely agree with what Steve said, right?

1106
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:25,380
Speaker 17:  Most of our ideas are bad. I think Johnny Eve's worst

1107
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:29,940
Speaker 17:  contribution to technology design in his entire career was putting

1108
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:33,420
Speaker 17:  a touch surface on a remote control. It's a terrible

1109
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,140
Speaker 17:  experience. I've never seen anybody do it right. If anyone should be able

1110
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,940
Speaker 17:  to do it, it's Apple and their remote is a joke.

1111
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,420
Speaker 2:  Yes. I could not agree more with this. The like true

1112
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:47,820
Speaker 2:  torturous of trying to figure out how to even hold that Siri

1113
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:51,740
Speaker 2:  remote in your hand was such a gigantic disaster

1114
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,780
Speaker 2:  to me. It's like Liam listening to you talk about it just made me think of

1115
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,900
Speaker 2:  the the keyboard that used to be in the Apple TV where you had to swipe from

1116
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,860
Speaker 2:  letter to letter and it was so fine in order to make

1117
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,340
Speaker 2:  it quick to swipe between things that actually landing on the letter you

1118
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:08,260
Speaker 2:  wanted to click on was like borderline impossible. It was awful. I will say

1119
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,980
Speaker 2:  the things that SJ is talking about about having these kind of

1120
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,620
Speaker 2:  different interactions built into the same thing, the single press, the long

1121
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,300
Speaker 2:  press whatever, I like that in theory I just have never seen

1122
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,540
Speaker 2:  anyone do it. Well I don't think

1123
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,900
Speaker 17:  Even the second version of this, this improved version of

1124
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,460
Speaker 17:  this remote still has a touch surface on it that's prone to

1125
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:33,780
Speaker 17:  like spurious inputs. Like you just accidentally do things

1126
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:37,180
Speaker 17:  while you're watching a movie that takes you outta the moment.

1127
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,380
Speaker 17:  And sorry, who thought putting this fucking Siri button on the side of the

1128
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:44,620
Speaker 17:  remote was a good idea? It's just like every time you try to take a screenshot

1129
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:48,340
Speaker 17:  on your iPhone, you accidentally turn it off or do some weird thing. It's

1130
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:49,260
Speaker 17:  like, it's like

1131
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,820
Speaker 16:  The screech on the phishing reel.

1132
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,820
Speaker 17:  It's like they're trolling us. It's like let's just See how crazy we can

1133
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:56,260
Speaker 17:  drive people.

1134
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:00,540
Speaker 2:  I would get more use out of the real spinning thing than I

1135
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,660
Speaker 2:  do with the Siri button because at least that's like a fidget spinner I can

1136
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,140
Speaker 2:  play with while I'm watching tv.

1137
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:09,220
Speaker 16:  What you can do is you can hold the trigger on the back of the

1138
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,540
Speaker 16:  remote and then use the

1139
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,580
Speaker 17:  Reel, oh my god.

1140
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,180
Speaker 16:  And it will put the volume up on the

1141
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:17,460
Speaker 17:  That

1142
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,620
Speaker 2:  Incredible remote

1143
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:22,020
Speaker 17:  That should be marketed as guaranteed divorce. Just

1144
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,780
Speaker 17:  pop this out next to your spouse and give it a go.

1145
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,180
Speaker 16:  So we we're talking a lot about what bad remote design is, but I wanna

1146
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:34,740
Speaker 16:  talk about what everyone thinks is good TV remote design.

1147
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:36,180
Speaker 16:  Okay, Liam, you go first.

1148
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,860
Speaker 17:  So this isn't the remote I use every day unfortunately, but my

1149
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:45,180
Speaker 17:  favorite remote of all time is the Xbox One media remote

1150
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:46,180
Speaker 2:  Of

1151
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,740
Speaker 17:  All time. Of all time. This

1152
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:49,940
Speaker 2:  Is what you want to really,

1153
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:53,580
Speaker 17:  This is the sword I'm gonna die on. I'm ready, willing and able hear me

1154
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,380
Speaker 17:  out. The Xbox One was a terrible product but from

1155
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:01,100
Speaker 17:  it came a great input device and if you've ever used a

1156
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,060
Speaker 17:  Microsoft input device, like go back to the Intelli Explorer

1157
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,420
Speaker 17:  Mouse from the nineties to their ergonomic keyboards. Microsoft knows

1158
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,980
Speaker 17:  how to make a good input device. And I think this is

1159
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:17,380
Speaker 17:  just like peak remote design. It's not made out of a slab

1160
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:21,260
Speaker 17:  of aluminum or any sort of fancy material, it's just a

1161
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:25,180
Speaker 17:  plastic remote with buttons on it. But what I like about it is the

1162
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,860
Speaker 17:  way it feels in my hand because it has a rounded back.

1163
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:32,100
Speaker 17:  However, even though it has a rounded back when you put it on your coffee

1164
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:36,060
Speaker 17:  table, it's still stands up straight, which is just kind of like a cool

1165
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,980
Speaker 17:  gimmicky bit. But I just, it makes me smile every time I see it.

1166
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:44,420
Speaker 17:  It has back lid buttons which are necessary only because

1167
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:47,260
Speaker 17:  all the buttons are black and it is a black remote, which I admit

1168
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:50,580
Speaker 2:  Right, it needs back lid buttons because it's a bad remote that you can't

1169
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,460
Speaker 2:  use without having to look down at it and blind yourself in the dark. This

1170
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,260
Speaker 2:  is, this is great. This is what I was hoping for too.

1171
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,260
Speaker 17:  Oh yeah, I hard disagree. It is definitely concession of the design to have

1172
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,700
Speaker 17:  it all black, but every design has compromises, right? You want something

1173
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:07,420
Speaker 17:  that doesn't look ugly on your coffee table that has like a giant Netflix

1174
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:11,580
Speaker 17:  logo and an Amazon logo and whatever else on it, right? This

1175
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,300
Speaker 17:  is a really nice looking design but is also really

1176
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:19,420
Speaker 17:  ergonomic. It feels really nice to use even though the buttons are

1177
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:23,460
Speaker 17:  covered with a layer of like soft touch plastic over the top

1178
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,380
Speaker 17:  to make it water resistant. They feel really nice when you click them

1179
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,580
Speaker 17:  up, down, left right are very easy even even though

1180
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:34,980
Speaker 17:  they're set inside a circle, they're very easy to distinguish with your

1181
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,900
Speaker 17:  thumb without looking at the remote. And then this is for me the most important

1182
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:42,300
Speaker 17:  thing and this is what makes this remote stand out to me. So

1183
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:46,660
Speaker 17:  most of our like media streamer remotes nowadays have about

1184
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:50,620
Speaker 17:  like 12 or 13 buttons on them, right? This new Siri remote or

1185
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,220
Speaker 17:  whatever it's called has I think 12 buttons if you count up, down, left,

1186
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:58,060
Speaker 17:  right as separate buttons. This has those same 13 buttons that you

1187
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,620
Speaker 17:  would normally have, but then it has for serious

1188
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:05,580
Speaker 17:  video watchers, some dedicated video control buttons at the bottom.

1189
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,060
Speaker 17:  So you can scrub forward back play pauses or let's say

1190
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:13,820
Speaker 17:  you're inside of a video playlist. This one in particularly I love

1191
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,740
Speaker 17:  you can skip to the next track. There isn't a button on most media

1192
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:21,420
Speaker 17:  streamer, actually I can't think of another one that has that button. So

1193
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,660
Speaker 17:  if I'm queuing up a playlist of my favorite must see TV

1194
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:28,780
Speaker 17:  sitcoms from the nineties on shuffle and you know,

1195
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,740
Speaker 17:  I've seen a couple too many episodes of Frazier, I can click this next

1196
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:36,620
Speaker 17:  track button and get there. So I just love it. It feels nice. It's not

1197
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:39,780
Speaker 17:  too heavy, it's not too small, it doesn't get lost in a couch

1198
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:44,540
Speaker 17:  regardless of what David might say. And yeah, I just love

1199
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:45,300
Speaker 17:  it. It's

1200
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:49,180
Speaker 2:  A good remote. Best of all time is is a truly wild take.

1201
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,180
Speaker 17:  All right, what do you got? What's better than this remote? I just

1202
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:55,900
Speaker 2:  Mostly feel like the thing you're controlling with it is your Xbox One,

1203
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:59,460
Speaker 2:  which immediately removes it from all contention forever and ever

1204
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,660
Speaker 17:  And ever. Oh okay. That's a really good point. This remote is

1205
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:06,380
Speaker 2:  Really good for operating a device that makes me want to

1206
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,740
Speaker 2:  throw it out the window 450 times a

1207
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:12,420
Speaker 17:  Day. Totally fair, totally fair. I should have started

1208
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:16,260
Speaker 17:  this whole thing with the Xbox One Media remote is

1209
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:20,300
Speaker 17:  using standard like media streamer IR encodes

1210
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,300
Speaker 17:  and you can get this to work on. I've, I've had it work on an

1211
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,940
Speaker 17:  Nvidia shield, I've had it work on an Apple tv, I've had it work on an Xbox

1212
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,460
Speaker 17:  series X, which it's so supposed to not work with. That's

1213
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:35,060
Speaker 2:  It's fair. I will say this is the kind of remote that I think like if Logitech

1214
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:38,980
Speaker 2:  made it and sold it as like a use it for all of your other kinds of

1215
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:42,740
Speaker 2:  devices remote, it would've done very well. My answer,

1216
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:46,060
Speaker 2:  I have two and ultimately I'm just gonna pick one, but I want to quickly

1217
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:50,180
Speaker 2:  honorable mention to the only remote that I have ever paid money for on

1218
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:54,020
Speaker 2:  purpose, which is the, the Roku. I have four

1219
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:57,100
Speaker 2:  Roku remotes on my desk right now. Like this is, this is the life I lead.

1220
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:01,340
Speaker 2:  I believe this is the Roku Voice Remote Pro. Yeah, this is a

1221
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:04,900
Speaker 2:  very good remote and it's very good for two reasons. One is because it's

1222
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,780
Speaker 2:  a little bigger and sort of, you know, heftier than the other Roku

1223
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:11,820
Speaker 2:  remotes, it's like feels better to hold, feels like a thing instead of the

1224
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:15,780
Speaker 2:  plastic nonsense that Roku mostly ships. But it has two things that are

1225
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:19,140
Speaker 2:  very good. One, it has integrated voice search, so you just press the microphone

1226
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:22,860
Speaker 2:  button, hold it up to your face and voice search. And two, it has a headphone

1227
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,740
Speaker 2:  jack and private listening on the Roku is like

1228
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:30,540
Speaker 2:  the single greatest streaming box innovation of the last decade

1229
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:34,500
Speaker 2:  as far as I'm concerned. I love it very much and Roku deserves huge credit.

1230
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,860
Speaker 2:  So feature-wise, I think this is my favorite remote ever. But in terms of

1231
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,780
Speaker 2:  like just the thing to hold in my hand and use, it's the Nvidia Shield remote.

1232
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:42,380
Speaker 16:  Oh,

1233
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,580
Speaker 17:  The Toone.

1234
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,380
Speaker 2:  Wow. It's a toone, it's a weird shape. Which is weird

1235
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:51,380
Speaker 2:  because it doesn't sit sort of pleasingly flat on my coffee table

1236
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,620
Speaker 2:  but I, I can pick it out from all the other remotes that I have. So it's,

1237
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:58,140
Speaker 2:  it's like unique. It feels really good to hold, which I think is important.

1238
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,660
Speaker 2:  Are you guys, when you're sitting on the couch watching something, are you

1239
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,700
Speaker 2:  holding the remote or is the remote on the couch next to you? Or is the remote

1240
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,460
Speaker 2:  on the coffee table?

1241
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,500
Speaker 17:  50 50?

1242
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:10,780
Speaker 16:  Yeah, as an audio engineer I am constantly moving the volume up

1243
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:11,940
Speaker 16:  and down on the tv

1244
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,180
Speaker 16:  so I, I love the Roku remote also, so I'm constantly like

1245
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,700
Speaker 16:  moving the buttons on the side of the Roku remote up and down

1246
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:26,100
Speaker 2:  Side. Volume controls also a good innovation of focus. Agree. Yeah, well

1247
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:30,060
Speaker 2:  done on that. But I, I will stop with the shield shortly here. But

1248
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,540
Speaker 2:  it, it is another one that has nice buttons. Kinda like you're talking about

1249
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:36,180
Speaker 2:  Liam where they're not super separated but you can kind of feel the difference

1250
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,340
Speaker 2:  between all of them. And Nvidia did a thing that I really like where it has

1251
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,340
Speaker 2:  a customizable button that you can like aggressively customize.

1252
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:47,220
Speaker 2:  It can do almost anything. It can launch almost anything. It can get to menus

1253
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,420
Speaker 2:  and you can have it do different things for one press, two presses, three

1254
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:54,140
Speaker 2:  presses. So it becomes a thing that's like I can hand this remote to somebody

1255
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,540
Speaker 2:  and they're gonna be able to figure out how to use it, but if I have it I'm

1256
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,780
Speaker 2:  better at it. And, I actually feel like that's sort of the sweet spot where

1257
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:04,620
Speaker 2:  like most of these kind of macro e remotes like s was talking

1258
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:08,460
Speaker 2:  about are going to have a huge learning curve. But I like these ones where

1259
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,660
Speaker 2:  it's like most people could just sit down and figure it out. But I have these

1260
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:15,300
Speaker 2:  like power tools on top of it and for that reason I feel like Nvidia really

1261
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:15,740
Speaker 2:  got this right.

1262
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:20,100
Speaker 17:  Okay, so the Nvidia Shield Toone is a gray

1263
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,860
Speaker 17:  remote. I have to agree. It's actually my half daily driver.

1264
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:28,340
Speaker 17:  So I watch movies using the Nvidia Shield and everything else on my Apple

1265
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,940
Speaker 17:  TV for the Nerds, it's just because I, I want pass through audio

1266
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:36,140
Speaker 17:  and Plex can do pass through audio on the video shield. But I do

1267
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:39,940
Speaker 17:  have a couple comments about this remote. One you just knocked my

1268
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:43,940
Speaker 17:  baby for having black on black buttons. Same thing also

1269
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:44,980
Speaker 17:  that remote's back lit.

1270
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,420
Speaker 2:  You can turn the back light off, you

1271
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:49,740
Speaker 17:  Can turn the back light off. But then it's really hard to see at night my

1272
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,900
Speaker 17:  one other knock on that remote and maybe this, maybe I just got a bad one,

1273
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,100
Speaker 17:  but I find the up down left right to

1274
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,100
Speaker 17:  be like I just, it doesn't feel like it's gonna last

1275
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,380
Speaker 17:  forever. Do you know what I mean? Like I've had it since the

1276
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,620
Speaker 17:  Nvidia Shield Pro came out. So what does that couple years, it just feels

1277
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:12,500
Speaker 17:  like it's not the way it was when I got it and it, it's starting to

1278
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,900
Speaker 17:  get a little less satisfying to click.

1279
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,020
Speaker 2:  That's fair. A lot of these like I have a couple of fire TV ones too that

1280
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:22,820
Speaker 2:  have the same kind of all one piece wheel and they all feel

1281
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:26,900
Speaker 2:  a little bit like they're one grain of dust away from

1282
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:30,580
Speaker 2:  just totally breaking. But I've been using the shield one for a long time

1283
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:34,180
Speaker 2:  and it's still fine. So I have high hopes Andru, I wanna know, I wanna know

1284
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:37,620
Speaker 2:  what yours is. Is it, is it the fishing rod? Please tell me. It's the fishing

1285
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:37,780
Speaker 2:  rod.

1286
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,660
Speaker 16:  It is not the fishing rod. I have to agree like I love the

1287
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:46,540
Speaker 16:  Roku remote and there's different reasons I think than what you said.

1288
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,580
Speaker 16:  Really like the play state, the way we watch TV now is not like

1289
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:54,460
Speaker 16:  dialing numbers and we don't go up and

1290
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:58,340
Speaker 16:  down usually on channels. So what this prioritizes

1291
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,340
Speaker 16:  is the play and pause. so like right where you're, when you're holding the

1292
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:06,020
Speaker 16:  remote, right where your thumb is is the play and pause button and that

1293
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:09,580
Speaker 16:  is the most important thing to do while you're watching tv, right?

1294
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,060
Speaker 16:  Yep.

1295
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,700
Speaker 2:  And it's a little like concave too. So your, your thumb just kind of nestles

1296
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,700
Speaker 2:  on it. It's they did it, it's, it's very nice.

1297
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,620
Speaker 16:  And then there is a home button and a back button

1298
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,580
Speaker 16:  and those are right at the top of the remote and you know, if you need to

1299
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:27,460
Speaker 16:  go back, just put your thumbs up to the back and it's

1300
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:31,420
Speaker 16:  just like a really flexible remote that's a product of like us being

1301
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:35,060
Speaker 16:  in the streaming world and they started to get it right during the

1302
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,980
Speaker 16:  TiVo days. I have this TiVo remote here and if you see

1303
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:43,260
Speaker 16:  this yellow button in the center of the remote is a pause button.

1304
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,700
Speaker 16:  And it is like they clearly understood that this was the most important

1305
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:50,780
Speaker 16:  part of the remote and it's like right where your thumb would be when you

1306
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:54,260
Speaker 16:  hold it. Anything that prioritizes the play and pause,

1307
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,980
Speaker 16:  that's where we should be going towards right now.

1308
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:00,860
Speaker 2:  I I had never thought about this until you said this, but now I'm looking

1309
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:04,580
Speaker 2:  at all these other remotes and almost none of them do. Yeah,

1310
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:08,380
Speaker 2:  like on this horrible Comcast remote. I couldn't even tell you what it's

1311
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:12,060
Speaker 2:  prioritizing but the play pause buttons are actually

1312
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,980
Speaker 2:  up from where you naturally hold it. So you have to like shimmy it in your

1313
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,900
Speaker 2:  hand just to get to the pause button. This Vizio remote, it really wants

1314
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,260
Speaker 2:  you to launch the Vizio Smart apps cuz that's cool and the thing people wanna

1315
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:25,180
Speaker 2:  do and most of them the volume is actually where your finger goes and

1316
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,060
Speaker 2:  that sort of makes sense. But I think you're totally right that play pause

1317
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,220
Speaker 2:  should be like naturally as you hold the thing, that's where your

1318
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:32,900
Speaker 2:  thumb should sit.

1319
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:37,060
Speaker 16:  Yeah. And while you're holding the remote you can hold pause and then

1320
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,220
Speaker 16:  do the volume up and down with your other finger at the same time. True.

1321
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,020
Speaker 16:  So you can really, it's really flexible. Yeah. And my LG

1322
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:47,580
Speaker 16:  remote that it comes with my TV has a Netflix button

1323
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,100
Speaker 16:  and Amazon Go button acknowledges that streaming is important.

1324
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,900
Speaker 16:  The play and pause button are all the way tiny at the bottom

1325
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,860
Speaker 16:  and it's so tiny you can't even tell like they're just next to each other.

1326
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,540
Speaker 16:  There's no prioritize of what

1327
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,860
Speaker 2:  Yeah's terrible is. Like

1328
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:06,020
Speaker 16:  How often am I going fast forwarding, you know, it's the same size as the

1329
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:09,020
Speaker 16:  play and the And the play and the pause button are separate buttons.

1330
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:12,060
Speaker 2:  I was just about to say we can, we can agree that play and pause should be

1331
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,580
Speaker 2:  the same button. Yeah. Right? Yeah absolutely.

1332
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:17,420
Speaker 16:  Okay and then can I just give an honorable mention please. Which is

1333
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,500
Speaker 16:  the Zenith space command remote,

1334
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:26,100
Speaker 16:  which is a very old TV remote from the

1335
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,660
Speaker 16:  sixties, seventies. All it is is just a tuning

1336
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:33,420
Speaker 16:  fork and you press the buttons, there's four buttons. One is channel

1337
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:37,180
Speaker 16:  lower volume mute on and off and channel higher.

1338
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:37,700
Speaker 16:  Can

1339
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,220
Speaker 2:  You press the buttons near your microphone? Cuz I suspect they make great

1340
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:40,700
Speaker 2:  noises.

1341
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:41,500
Speaker 16:  Yes,

1342
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,300
Speaker 2:  That's what I'm talking about right there. Yeah, that's a button.

1343
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:50,260
Speaker 16:  There's a really high frequency that is chiming with this

1344
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:53,980
Speaker 16:  tuning fork in the remote. Then the TV picks it up and And

1345
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:57,900
Speaker 16:  does that command And? I just love it because it is just stays

1346
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:01,580
Speaker 16:  flat on the table. It is just a chocolate bar

1347
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:04,700
Speaker 16:  basically and it has four big buttons.

1348
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,300
Speaker 16:  And I. Just want a remote like this again that's just a thing with four

1349
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:09,860
Speaker 16:  big buttons.

1350
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,380
Speaker 2:  So that doesn't use infrared,

1351
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,380
Speaker 16:  It uses sound correct? Yeah.

1352
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:15,140
Speaker 2:  Incredible.

1353
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,340
Speaker 16:  It does not use any electronics. It is just you press

1354
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:23,300
Speaker 16:  a button and it makes an actual sound with a tuning fork that changes the

1355
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:23,500
Speaker 16:  tv.

1356
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:27,580
Speaker 2:  This would absolutely not work in 2023.

1357
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,540
Speaker 2:  But no I love it.

1358
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,700
Speaker 16:  There should be an adapter that you could plug your TV into to use this

1359
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:31,900
Speaker 16:  thing.

1360
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:35,300
Speaker 2:  Andru this, this brings me to a big picture question that I've been wondering

1361
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,340
Speaker 2:  about. And, I. Wonder if you talked to Steven and Sge about it too, which

1362
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,220
Speaker 2:  is that it seems like the world should go in one of two directions. Either

1363
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:46,380
Speaker 2:  all of these companies need to care about and design and build better

1364
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:50,220
Speaker 2:  remotes that work for everybody. And, I wonder if that's even possible. Especially

1365
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:54,060
Speaker 2:  because all this stuff is so mainstream now that like if Roku radically redesigned

1366
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:57,700
Speaker 2:  their remote, I kind of feel like it would go badly. The Apple TV is a perfect

1367
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:01,220
Speaker 2:  example, right? But then on the other side there have been various

1368
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,740
Speaker 2:  attempts at like making of remote industry. Logitech sold the harmony.

1369
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:08,660
Speaker 2:  There was like the Cavo was a thing for a minute there. Like people have

1370
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:12,620
Speaker 2:  tried to do universal remotes and even when do you guys remember when everybody

1371
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,780
Speaker 2:  was like, oh we're gonna make a universal remote that's also a smart home

1372
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:19,180
Speaker 2:  controller. And that had a moment Google was like just

1373
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:22,220
Speaker 2:  screw that user smartphone. Now they have a remote that's kind of like everybody

1374
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:25,460
Speaker 2:  else's remote. Can we make an accessory industry out of this?

1375
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,980
Speaker 2:  Can TV makers do this or are we just sort of stuck in

1376
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:33,380
Speaker 2:  this crappy world of mediocre remotes forever?

1377
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,060
Speaker 2:  What's your sense coming out of all this?

1378
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,100
Speaker 17:  Well I talked to Sge a little bit about the future of this

1379
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:42,660
Speaker 19:  Now with virtual reality and AR and all of that coming in. Maybe there's

1380
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:45,380
Speaker 19:  something else. I don't know, we won't be even looking at each other.

1381
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:50,420
Speaker 19:  So remotes are like maybe a small part

1382
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,380
Speaker 19:  of the larger problem that the technology revolution

1383
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,220
Speaker 19:  is going to kind of bring us. And now there are like TVs you can

1384
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,380
Speaker 19:  control with your phones. So You don't even actually need a remote control.

1385
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,460
Speaker 19:  Phones in some cases have also become a second

1386
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,420
Speaker 19:  screen for televisions for example. There are

1387
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:13,380
Speaker 19:  ways things you can do with second screen. You're watching something on

1388
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:16,860
Speaker 19:  let's say Amazon Prime on your TV and

1389
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:21,060
Speaker 19:  there is a product that you saw. Your phone could tell you

1390
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:23,460
Speaker 19:  what that product is and you can buy it from Amazon.

1391
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:28,060
Speaker 2:  I think the phone remote idea is horrible. And I hate every phone

1392
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:31,460
Speaker 2:  remote cuz you have to look at it. It's like it's the opposite of what I'm

1393
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,780
Speaker 2:  looking for in a remote, which is like a thing that I can hold in my hand

1394
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:37,700
Speaker 2:  that doesn't light up like Liam's stupid remote and doesn't make me

1395
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,820
Speaker 2:  look at it like Liam's stupid remote and doesn't get lost in the cushions.

1396
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:44,700
Speaker 2:  Like Liam's stupid remote. I just want like a little brick

1397
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:48,300
Speaker 2:  that I can feel. This is like, I just keep thinking about like Apple's Vision

1398
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,260
Speaker 2:  Pro where it's like the sort of look and click your fingers and I'm like

1399
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,180
Speaker 2:  that's the closest thing to a sort of virtual remote interface that I'm

1400
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:59,020
Speaker 2:  interested in. I hate the smartphone as remote thing. It's fine in a pinch

1401
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:02,900
Speaker 2:  when I lose Liam's stupid remote in the couch cushions. But it

1402
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,700
Speaker 2:  is not what I'm looking for like day to day at all.

1403
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:09,860
Speaker 17:  Yeah. I absolutely hate the reliance on

1404
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:13,700
Speaker 17:  a smartphone to control things. And, I think it's becoming a problem in

1405
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,420
Speaker 17:  like the home theater world. Like if you buy a soundbar, a lot of times

1406
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:21,300
Speaker 17:  there's functionality locked behind the app.

1407
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,500
Speaker 17:  So they give you one of these cheap pack and remotes. But if you want to

1408
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,420
Speaker 17:  change how it's processing atmos or something like that, you gotta

1409
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:33,860
Speaker 17:  download the app and link it up to this box. And is this company going to

1410
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:37,380
Speaker 17:  continue to develop this app? Because we know you can't just make an app

1411
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,100
Speaker 17:  and put it on the smartphone and expect it to just continue working forever,

1412
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:44,180
Speaker 17:  right? You have to continue to develop it to make sure it continues to work.

1413
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,340
Speaker 17:  So every time I see TV companies saying something like that

1414
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,940
Speaker 17:  or home theater companies, it's like you've already proven to us that you

1415
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:55,740
Speaker 17:  make terrible software. Just, just the worst imaginable.

1416
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:59,100
Speaker 17:  I like yeah, only the audio industry can eclipse you in making terrible

1417
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:03,220
Speaker 17:  software. And you want me to use your iOS app to

1418
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:07,260
Speaker 17:  actually control your device? No, thank you. I don't get my iPhone out to

1419
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:11,100
Speaker 17:  control my TV unless I have just absolutely given up.

1420
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:14,220
Speaker 2:  Because you've lost your Xbox remote in the couch cushions again.

1421
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,380
Speaker 17:  Yes. J just to be clear back check here David.

1422
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:22,020
Speaker 17:  Your remote lights up is also hard to see in the dark and

1423
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:26,180
Speaker 17:  is smaller than mine by thickness. So is easier to get lost on the couch.

1424
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,220
Speaker 17:  So you know, just point that out.

1425
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:32,340
Speaker 2:  That's outrageous. My to lone sticks out when it falls into the couch. And

1426
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:35,300
Speaker 2:  I just yank it right out. It's like the sword and the stone style. I just

1427
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,940
Speaker 2:  pull it outta the couch, get back to it.

1428
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,180
Speaker 16:  You know something I liked And I know you guys are gonna have some feelings

1429
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:44,940
Speaker 16:  about the Weu controller with the whole

1430
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,500
Speaker 16:  screen on it. Oh, if I have a TV with a second

1431
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,820
Speaker 16:  screen controller, Ooh, what do you think about that?

1432
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,940
Speaker 2:  So basically what if my Nintendo switch was also my TV

1433
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:56,420
Speaker 2:  remote?

1434
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:57,220
Speaker 16:  Yeah. Yeah.

1435
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:01,340
Speaker 2:  I love this. I'm in, that's the most impractical thing I've ever heard. And,

1436
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,380
Speaker 2:  I love it already.

1437
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,820
Speaker 17:  I'm no, absolutely. I don't want software and screens to control my

1438
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,540
Speaker 17:  viewing experience. Yeah.

1439
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:13,020
Speaker 16:  One more thing before we go. I want to talk about voice

1440
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:17,020
Speaker 16:  control. Mm. And whether you think we can rely totally on

1441
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,900
Speaker 16:  that or is this an added feature or we should just not use

1442
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,540
Speaker 16:  it at all? I don't like it.

1443
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:26,140
Speaker 17:  I find it really handy for search when you're looking for something with

1444
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:30,100
Speaker 17:  like an obnoxious title to type out. But I very rarely use

1445
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:30,220
Speaker 17:  it.

1446
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:34,340
Speaker 2:  That's interesting. I use it a lot, but only for search. I think the idea

1447
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:38,180
Speaker 2:  that it's gonna be easier to lift my remote to my mouth and say open

1448
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:42,020
Speaker 2:  Netflix than it will be to just press the Netflix button is just never

1449
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:45,780
Speaker 2:  gonna be the case. But search on screens is

1450
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:49,500
Speaker 2:  awful and you know, going left, left, left, right, right, right up, down,

1451
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,420
Speaker 2:  up, down to get to the letter is just sucks. And that's also a place I use

1452
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:56,380
Speaker 2:  my smartphone a lot. Like Roku has the thing where you can type with your

1453
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:00,100
Speaker 2:  phone keyboard into the text box on the screen.

1454
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:04,100
Speaker 2:  Love that. But I use voice pretty regularly if I know what I

1455
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,900
Speaker 2:  wanna watch, that's almost always the fastest way for me to get there.

1456
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:12,300
Speaker 2:  But I don't, if that was my only remote, it would drive me and everyone else

1457
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,180
Speaker 2:  in my home. Crazy. Right. I mean. I just think about all the times that like

1458
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:20,580
Speaker 2:  Siri activates because of something it hears on my television and

1459
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:24,420
Speaker 2:  like good God, if it could control the TV in the process, I'd be, I'd be

1460
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:24,700
Speaker 2:  screwed.

1461
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:28,740
Speaker 16:  Yeah. The only time that has worked really well for me is in like

1462
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,540
Speaker 16:  2018 when I asked my Google Home play

1463
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:36,820
Speaker 16:  Stranger Things in my living room. And that has only, the

1464
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:40,060
Speaker 16:  only time it's ever worked is specifically watching Stranger Things on Netflix,

1465
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:40,580
Speaker 16:  but

1466
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,500
Speaker 2:  It probably felt like magic.

1467
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:45,580
Speaker 16:  Yeah, it felt like magic. It felt like the future. And ever

1468
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:49,220
Speaker 16:  since then nothing has really worked as well with voice for me.

1469
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:52,380
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that sounds about right. So, okay, I know, I know we have to go here,

1470
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,620
Speaker 2:  but did you ask them about the grandparent thing where you have to cover

1471
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:59,340
Speaker 2:  80% of the buttons and and then hand it to them? It's like the

1472
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,940
Speaker 2:  babysitter test was always the one that I I think of too, right? Because

1473
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:05,660
Speaker 2:  these are like social objects, right? Lots of people use them. Do they look

1474
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:09,540
Speaker 2:  at this and think, okay, the fact that you have to like sharpie an

1475
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:12,900
Speaker 2:  arrow to the play button and the guide button because those are the only

1476
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,380
Speaker 2:  ones that people should touch. Is that like a miserable design failure of

1477
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:17,980
Speaker 2:  anyone who has ever tried to make remotes?

1478
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:20,700
Speaker 16:  Yeah. Steve in particular called this out.

1479
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:25,020
Speaker 18:  Most designers, especially remote controlled designers, we're in a funny

1480
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:28,940
Speaker 18:  position. Like where we have I think a certain responsibility to try and

1481
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:32,740
Speaker 18:  push the state of the art to be a little bit better, even if that's

1482
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:36,100
Speaker 18:  means you're just putting a little bit more work into your onscreen menu

1483
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:39,340
Speaker 18:  design or whatever it is. Or advocating in that critical meeting to

1484
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:43,820
Speaker 18:  spend another 10 cents per unit or something like that. But because I think

1485
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:47,380
Speaker 18:  a lot of people are, they're given the remote and they have no choice. And.

1486
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:51,100
Speaker 18:  I feel like we have a little bit of responsibility to kind of tip the

1487
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,980
Speaker 18:  balance to them. And if you see these little photographs of people

1488
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,620
Speaker 18:  saving, like taking their grandparents remotes and covering over all the

1489
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:02,140
Speaker 18:  buttons except for the volume and the PBS button or something like that.

1490
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,420
Speaker 18:  But it's a little bit of failure in it. I feel like we could do a little

1491
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:06,020
Speaker 18:  better there.

1492
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:10,860
Speaker 2:  Yeah, like I, I would like fewer buttons on remotes in general, but

1493
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:14,620
Speaker 2:  I also think like clarity above all things, right? Even if you're gonna hand

1494
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:17,740
Speaker 2:  me a remote full of buttons, most people are relatively smart. They should

1495
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:21,380
Speaker 2:  be able to figure out what is going on. I was looking while you were talking

1496
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,420
Speaker 2:  and speaking of the back button on the Roku remote, I'm back on my Silver

1497
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:28,860
Speaker 2:  Xfinity remote and there are six things on here that you could

1498
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:32,860
Speaker 2:  plausibly think are the back button. Like if I just wanna go back one.

1499
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:36,860
Speaker 2:  Yeah. There are literally six things that I think I could plausibly argue

1500
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:40,220
Speaker 2:  are the right one. I'm pretty sure I know what the right one is, but I genuinely

1501
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:44,100
Speaker 2:  don't know for sure. And it's like, let's fix that problem and then then

1502
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:47,260
Speaker 2:  we can worry about having a million buttons for a million streaming services.

1503
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:51,140
Speaker 2:  Like just teach me where back is and And then we can go from there. Exactly.

1504
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,700
Speaker 2:  Can you, can you play us out with the fishing rod? We should take a break,

1505
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,500
Speaker 2:  but I just want to hear from the fishing rod one more time before we go.

1506
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:06,900
Speaker 2:  And with that he launches Hulu. All right, thank you both.

1507
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,900
Speaker 2:  You listening should email us all of your thoughts about your favorite remotes

1508
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,340
Speaker 2:  ever, Vergecast of The Verge dot com. Send us your favorite remote ever,

1509
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:17,660
Speaker 2:  ideally with a picture, and we'll talk about as many of them as we can on

1510
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:21,620
Speaker 2:  the show. This is delightful. Andru Liam, thank you both. Again. Let's

1511
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,940
Speaker 2:  do the hotline, wrap the show up

1512
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,900
Speaker 2:  As a reminder, the hotline number is eight six six Verge one, one call and

1513
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,740
Speaker 2:  ask us all your deepest, darkest, weirdest tech questions. We

1514
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:38,980
Speaker 2:  love them all. Before we get into this week's question, let me just play

1515
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:42,860
Speaker 2:  you a voicemail we got from Sean who called in to respond to last week's

1516
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,660
Speaker 2:  question about how to keep your battery healthy for longer.

1517
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,740
Speaker 22:  Hey, hey, this is Sean from Clearwater, Florida talking about phone

1518
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,740
Speaker 22:  batteries. I drive for a living, so I have apps that track me

1519
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,740
Speaker 22:  and take up a bunch of my battery life. So I

1520
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:02,660
Speaker 22:  found out that it overheats really bad doing that. So what

1521
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:06,460
Speaker 22:  I've done is clip my phone to an air conditioner vent

1522
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,460
Speaker 22:  in my truck and that will keep that phone battery. Nice

1523
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:14,460
Speaker 22:  and cool. Not using as much electricity. Okay. Hope it helps.

1524
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,060
Speaker 22:  Bye.

1525
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:19,140
Speaker 2:  I love this. These are our people. Thank you Vercast listeners for being

1526
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:23,180
Speaker 2:  as weird about technology as we are. All right, this week's question

1527
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:25,220
Speaker 2:  more on tv. It comes from Rahul.

1528
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:30,140
Speaker 23:  Hi David and Verge team. My name is Rahul,

1529
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,900
Speaker 23:  I'm in San Antonio, Texas. I'm calling to ask you guys

1530
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:38,060
Speaker 23:  about TVs, particularly devices for TVs

1531
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:41,820
Speaker 23:  cuz I'm tired of the crappy software on my lg OLED

1532
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:45,420
Speaker 23:  tv. And I. Refuse to get an Apple tv. That seems to be the only decent

1533
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:49,460
Speaker 23:  option out there. What does Google have nowadays? I had an Android

1534
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:52,980
Speaker 23:  TV years ago. I had other products. I know the shield

1535
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,740
Speaker 23:  exists, but it's, it's old now. So is there anything

1536
01:26:56,750 --> 01:27:00,580
Speaker 23:  newer, anything updated since the Shield TV for an Android

1537
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:04,460
Speaker 23:  user to watch since streaming on their tv? I appreciate

1538
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,420
Speaker 23:  you answer this. Thanks.

1539
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:09,940
Speaker 2:  All right. First of all, I love this question because Rahul, you

1540
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:13,420
Speaker 2:  feel the pain that I feel with set top boxes, which is that they're mostly

1541
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,100
Speaker 2:  all very bad. The Apple TV has some stuff going for it. The shield, like

1542
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:20,780
Speaker 2:  you said, has some stuff going for it, but I want there to just be one that

1543
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,700
Speaker 2:  is like the one you should get and there just really isn't. But I think there

1544
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:28,540
Speaker 2:  are really two answers to your question. One is the Nvidia

1545
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:32,580
Speaker 2:  Shield, which just from a pure raw power perspective is still

1546
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:36,860
Speaker 2:  probably the best Android thing on the market. It's a little

1547
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:40,740
Speaker 2:  overkill for a lot of things and some people aren't gonna love the way that

1548
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:44,460
Speaker 2:  you have to kind of maintain the interface and all that stuff, but it's

1549
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:48,140
Speaker 2:  still very good. It's pretty expensive, but it's very good. But I would say

1550
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:51,620
Speaker 2:  for my money at this moment, Google's latest

1551
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:55,660
Speaker 2:  Chromecast, the one with Google TV is probably the one

1552
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:59,620
Speaker 2:  to get, you can get the new Chromecast for as little as 30 bucks. It

1553
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:01,980
Speaker 2:  comes with a remote now, which is great cause you don't have to just use

1554
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:05,580
Speaker 2:  your phone, but it's still just a dongle that plugs into your tv. The $30

1555
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:09,180
Speaker 2:  one is just 10 80 p and the $50 one

1556
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:13,420
Speaker 2:  does 4K and HDR and all the rest of that stuff. I would

1557
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:17,180
Speaker 2:  direct you to the $50 one for all those reasons, but

1558
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:21,060
Speaker 2:  also because it comes in more colors. The $30 Chromecast just comes in. White

1559
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:25,380
Speaker 2:  And, I don't care for the dongle, but that white remote is gonna

1560
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,420
Speaker 2:  get gross really, really fast. Maybe your less gross

1561
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:33,500
Speaker 2:  about like eating Cheetos and then using your TV remote than I am, but

1562
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,380
Speaker 2:  that's just what happens. My remote would be truly disgusting if I had

1563
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:40,340
Speaker 2:  that white one around. But the the new Chromecast is good. It has Google

1564
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,540
Speaker 2:  tv, which does a really good job aggregating content and recommendations

1565
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,500
Speaker 2:  and finding all that stuff. The remote works pretty well. It's not my favorite,

1566
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,100
Speaker 2:  but it's like eight buttons in a D pad. It's pretty simple and straightforward.

1567
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:55,260
Speaker 2:  You'll figure it out. The Chromecast has all of the apps you probably

1568
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,060
Speaker 2:  want, including Apple tv, which was a late addition to the Google TV stuff.

1569
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:02,880
Speaker 2:  But it's there now. It just does a good job of being content first in the

1570
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,760
Speaker 2:  way that some others aren't. So that's where I would start you.

1571
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,560
Speaker 2:  It's not terribly expensive. Works pretty well. It's a boring answer, but

1572
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,840
Speaker 2:  just buy a Chromecast. I think that's the one. All right, that's it for The
