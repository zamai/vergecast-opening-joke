Description: On this episode of The Vergecast, the fourth and final installment of our series on the five senses of video games, we asked Polygon’s Charlie Hall to help us make sense of the current state of the art in flight simulation. Hall, who once spent more than four months in VR mapping the edge of the Milky Way galaxy in Elite: Dangerous, has more experience in a virtual cockpit than most. We wanted to know how the pros set up their simulators to get the most realistic experience and why it’s so complicated to make a virtual world look like the real one.

2
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:17,965
Speaker 3:  so excited we get to like, have you on instead of just

3
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,965
Speaker 3:  you were like all up about wanting to do a whole thing about televisions.

4
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:56,165
Speaker 1:  I did. I am a huge display nerd. I find new

5
00:01:56,845 --> 00:02:00,765
Speaker 1:  tandem ole screens to just be, to me, that's my sports,

6
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,365
Speaker 1:  but David wouldn't let me do that. Listener lucky for you.

7
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:07,925
Speaker 3:  Nothing makes great audio like deep dives into display

8
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:09,885
Speaker 3:  technology. That's, that's kinda how I feel.

9
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:14,325
Speaker 1:  Agree to disagree, agree to disagree. But yeah, the, the journey

10
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:18,245
Speaker 1:  took me back to my childhood, which was a very big surprise. And it turns

11
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:22,285
Speaker 1:  out the thing that was the the most advanced, most

12
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:25,965
Speaker 1:  spectacular visual experience you could have back when I was a kid

13
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:30,085
Speaker 1:  is arguably still the same thing. And that's flight simulators. Mm.

14
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:34,085
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Back when I was a kid, flight simulator was the thing I wanted to try

15
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:37,805
Speaker 1:  but couldn't, didn't have the computing power. So I, I just kind of admired

16
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:41,325
Speaker 1:  it from afar and stopped paying attention to it once I got a little older.

17
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:45,805
Speaker 1:  But fast forward to this episode and, and looking around at what

18
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,365
Speaker 1:  the visual landscape is in gaming and I was blown away

19
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:53,565
Speaker 1:  by what you can recreate in a flight simulator today. It's

20
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:57,365
Speaker 1:  just astonishing. So I reached out to Polygon, I said, who's the

21
00:02:57,365 --> 00:03:00,445
Speaker 1:  flight sim person that I should be speaking to about this? And of course

22
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:04,205
Speaker 1:  they partnered me up with Charlie Hall, who I had a great conversation with

23
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:07,365
Speaker 1:  about all this. But what I really wanted to find out was

24
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:11,685
Speaker 1:  in 2024, what is the best way to experience a flight

25
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:15,165
Speaker 1:  simulator? Is it creating a wall of monitors? Is it

26
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:18,925
Speaker 1:  strapping a VR headset on? Is it something in between?

27
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,205
Speaker 1:  And the answer was not as obvious as I thought it would be. And Charlie really

28
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:27,085
Speaker 1:  helped me understand what is a gimmick and what is actually useful when you're

29
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:29,325
Speaker 1:  trying to fly a virtual airplane. Okay.

30
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:32,645
Speaker 3:  So before we get into it, just give me the like super high level,

31
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:36,845
Speaker 3:  what is it about Flight Simulator that is so sort of uniquely

32
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:40,565
Speaker 3:  visual? Like when I think of really visual games, you think about the sort

33
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:44,485
Speaker 3:  of big huge open world like No Man Sky kind of games with like

34
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:47,685
Speaker 3:  beautiful graphics and it's always in space and everything is happening.

35
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:51,085
Speaker 3:  Flight Simulator seems otherwise like, it's just like a bunch of buttons

36
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:53,885
Speaker 3:  and you're in a cockpit. Like what, what is it about Flight Simulator that

37
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,965
Speaker 3:  felt so like specifically visual to you?

38
00:03:56,725 --> 00:04:00,165
Speaker 1:  Absolutely. The more fantasy like games,

39
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:04,445
Speaker 1:  in fact even flight simulators that take place in space are actually a lot

40
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:08,285
Speaker 1:  easier for us to create because they're not based on something in real life

41
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:12,085
Speaker 1:  that we can compare it to. Whereas in a flight simulator, like for instance,

42
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:16,365
Speaker 1:  Microsoft, Flight Simulator, you've got models of real planes at real

43
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:19,925
Speaker 1:  airports. You're actually flying a real life

44
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,725
Speaker 1:  recreation of planet Earth. You can literally fly

45
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:27,885
Speaker 1:  all the way around the earth and If, you were to look at a bird's eye view

46
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:31,845
Speaker 1:  of what you're seeing. It is one to one exact to

47
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,005
Speaker 1:  satellite imagery that Microsoft has been building over many, many years.

48
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,965
Speaker 3:  And if I'm not mistaken, there are a lot of people on the internet who like

49
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:42,885
Speaker 3:  make it their job to find when that is wrong. And

50
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:46,645
Speaker 3:  that like the stakes for screwing up the length of a runway at the airport

51
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:48,725
Speaker 3:  in flight simulator are actually like pretty high.

52
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:53,005
Speaker 1:  Very high, yes. Okay. Everything from the hat switches to the

53
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:56,725
Speaker 1:  airports to the airplane reflections on the outside. They, they try for

54
00:04:57,225 --> 00:05:00,885
Speaker 1:  the most accurate representation as you can get. And that's a lot harder

55
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:05,125
Speaker 1:  than just creating some wacky looking spaceship that you'd

56
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,725
Speaker 1:  see in in a Sci-fi movie.

57
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,885
Speaker 3:  Got it. Fair enough. All right, well, before we get into it, I should say

58
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:14,085
Speaker 3:  I haven't really been a flight simulator guy and still I'm sitting here looking

59
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:17,445
Speaker 3:  at my one measly 24 inch monitor and I feel like this episode is about to

60
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:21,325
Speaker 3:  cost me a tremendous amount of money. So with that as a warning to everybody,

61
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:22,485
Speaker 3:  here's Liam and Charlie.

62
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:28,285
Speaker 1:  Charlie Hall, Welcome To, The Vergecast. Glad to be here. So I

63
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:32,085
Speaker 1:  was lucky enough to be the producer chosen to do the Vision

64
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:35,685
Speaker 1:  episode for this gaming series that we've been running the last three

65
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:39,445
Speaker 1:  Sundays. I couldn't help myself. I went back to being an

66
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:42,405
Speaker 1:  8-year-old kid with Packard Bell 46 computer

67
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:46,885
Speaker 1:  wanting to play video games. And the one I wanted

68
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:50,805
Speaker 1:  to play the most but couldn't actually run on my machine was

69
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,085
Speaker 1:  Microsoft Flight Simulator.

70
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:55,765
Speaker 4:  Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. The, the original like

71
00:05:56,225 --> 00:06:00,005
Speaker 4:  crisis for PC gaming, right. Does it run Flight

72
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:00,605
Speaker 4:  Simulator?

73
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:05,165
Speaker 1:  Absolutely. This was 1993 or 1994. And yeah,

74
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,045
Speaker 1:  I just, I couldn't run Flight Simulator and probably because of that,

75
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:13,005
Speaker 1:  right? I wanted to play it so badly, even though as

76
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:17,405
Speaker 1:  you know, a third grade kid, I probably wouldn't have had the

77
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:21,365
Speaker 1:  patience to sit through the pre-flight checks and actually get a plane off

78
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:24,565
Speaker 1:  the ground in Flight Simulator. Didn't matter. I wanted to play that game

79
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:28,405
Speaker 1:  because it just felt like something above and

80
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:32,005
Speaker 1:  beyond a normal video game that you were flying in the air, but it also

81
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:36,245
Speaker 1:  felt as close to real in 19 93, 19 94

82
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:37,805
Speaker 1:  graphics that you could get.

83
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:38,805
Speaker 4:  Absolutely.

84
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:42,965
Speaker 1:  So fast forward to today, working adult with a salary.

85
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:47,165
Speaker 1:  I could actually afford things like a gaming PC that could run Flight Simulator.

86
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:51,125
Speaker 1:  I wanted to see what does Flight Simulator feel like and look like

87
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:55,245
Speaker 1:  today, and quite a bit has changed in Flight Simulator in

88
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:55,765
Speaker 1:  30 years.

89
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:56,805
Speaker 4:  It has.

90
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:00,645
Speaker 1:  So maybe you could tell me a little bit about your experience with Flight

91
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:04,485
Speaker 1:  Simulator. I know that Microsoft's been doing this for quite some

92
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:08,405
Speaker 1:  time, but you know, there was some time in between where there was

93
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:12,765
Speaker 1:  a dearth of flight simulators out there. What's the deal with Microsoft?

94
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,085
Speaker 1:  Flight Simulator? Well,

95
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:18,125
Speaker 4:  Much like you, I started playing Microsoft Flight Simulator in

96
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:22,005
Speaker 4:  like the, the late eighties, early nineties. My

97
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:26,085
Speaker 4:  dad actually worked at Bell Laboratories here in, in northern

98
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:30,325
Speaker 4:  Illinois. So he was able to bring home kind of is almost like

99
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:33,365
Speaker 4:  company surplus, these fairly high-end

100
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:36,645
Speaker 4:  switching terminals, basically. So I had a PC

101
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:40,405
Speaker 4:  sixty three hundred and eighty eighty six board. And so I was playing an

102
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:44,325
Speaker 4:  old version of Microsoft Flight Simulator. I had the ad lib sound card, right?

103
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:48,045
Speaker 4:  So I had all the good stuff and I had my gravis joystick

104
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:48,445
Speaker 4:  there.

105
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,445
Speaker 1:  Oh wow. You had a gravis.

106
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,325
Speaker 4:  I did, but it, it didn't have the twist rudder, right? So I had to do rudder

107
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:58,125
Speaker 4:  with the keyboard anyway. And so I was able to take off and get

108
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,445
Speaker 4:  up and going from MIGS field, you know, back when there was a MIGS field

109
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:04,805
Speaker 4:  before Mayor Daley put a couple of exes through it. And that really

110
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:09,045
Speaker 4:  gave birth to this kind of life long gaming

111
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:13,445
Speaker 4:  obsession with flight for me. I went deep on flight

112
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:17,405
Speaker 4:  simulator, I got all the mods as they were going up for clearance at Toys

113
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:21,445
Speaker 4:  Ross. Right? I remember a science fair project that I did

114
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:25,165
Speaker 4:  in eighth grade where I combined Sim City and

115
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,085
Speaker 4:  Microsoft Flight Simulator and took the teacher on a tour

116
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:32,885
Speaker 4:  of my sim city that I had rebuilt in

117
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:36,365
Speaker 4:  Microsoft Flight Simulator. Like I was way into it as a kid.

118
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,805
Speaker 1:  I just need to pause, I just need to pause for a moment to just tell the

119
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:43,525
Speaker 1:  listener the, the face I just had on was in of, of

120
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:47,805
Speaker 1:  complete awe. I mean, those were the games of my childhood sim

121
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:51,605
Speaker 1:  city flight simulator that, that was so impressed, so impressed. Go on. I

122
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:52,845
Speaker 1:  I apologize for interrupting.

123
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,725
Speaker 4:  But the way that Microsoft Flight Simulator was built

124
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:01,805
Speaker 4:  back in the day was entirely by hand. The, the

125
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:05,685
Speaker 4:  John Hancock building, the Prudential building, all of those

126
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:09,365
Speaker 4:  famous buildings in the Chicago skyline were built

127
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:13,685
Speaker 4:  by hand. So If you, If you went too long on your approach and you

128
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:17,525
Speaker 4:  hit the Adler Planetarium there at the end of MIGS Field. Like somebody put

129
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:21,125
Speaker 4:  that there to impeach your progress in the game. But that is not

130
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,525
Speaker 4:  necessarily the case in the modern version of

131
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:28,005
Speaker 4:  Microsoft Flight Simulator. And we can, we can certainly get to the modern

132
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:31,085
Speaker 4:  version of Microsoft Flight Simulator. But you know, for a while there

133
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:35,445
Speaker 4:  Microsoft kind of kept the heartbeat going,

134
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,845
Speaker 4:  right? And then kind of some new competitors came into the space.

135
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:43,365
Speaker 4:  XPLAN is another really popular platform that kind of

136
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:47,085
Speaker 4:  grew up during the, the early two thousands and kind of came

137
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:51,085
Speaker 4:  of age and kind of the 20 teams. But then there was this

138
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:55,165
Speaker 4:  big surge of space flight simulation as well.

139
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:59,245
Speaker 4:  This Chris Roberts, one of the co-creators of the

140
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:02,965
Speaker 4:  Wing Commander franchise, kind of brought that back to life with Star Citizen,

141
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:07,125
Speaker 4:  this massive ongoing decade long project to,

142
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:10,805
Speaker 4:  to recreate kind of the nineties dream of Wing

143
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:13,925
Speaker 4:  commander inside that game. And then of course, elite

144
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:18,405
Speaker 4:  came into its own with a brand new version called Elite Dangerous.

145
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:22,245
Speaker 4:  And I've, I've also had the experience in both of those. But after

146
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:26,485
Speaker 4:  both of those products came to market, that's when Microsoft came

147
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:30,565
Speaker 4:  back to it basically with this new vision for

148
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:34,525
Speaker 4:  Microsoft Flight Simulator. Which while there are some things in the game

149
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:38,365
Speaker 4:  that are kind of made and rendered and and done by hand,

150
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,645
Speaker 4:  the vast majority of the game is, is not done by hand. It's actually done

151
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,045
Speaker 4:  with a very sophisticated, almost kind of

152
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,085
Speaker 4:  photogrammetry, which we can discuss too.

153
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:52,565
Speaker 1:  So yeah, 2020 rolls around and Microsoft releases what

154
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,845
Speaker 1:  to a layman's eyes like mine looks like

155
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,525
Speaker 1:  photorealistic flight simulation. How do they pull that off? Have GPUs

156
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:04,285
Speaker 1:  just gotten so good? What's, what is it that's making this look

157
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,005
Speaker 1:  so pretty?

158
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:09,285
Speaker 4:  Well, you gotta remember that Microsoft is, well it's a, it's a very

159
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:12,445
Speaker 4:  large company, Liam. And in addition to

160
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,365
Speaker 4:  having in its portfolio Microsoft Flight

161
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:19,685
Speaker 4:  Simulator, which I don't know if you're aware, is its oldest

162
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:23,765
Speaker 4:  piece of published software. It's older even than Windows.

163
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:27,805
Speaker 4:  In addition to owning Microsoft, Flight Simulator, well it

164
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:31,485
Speaker 4:  also owns this little thing called Bing. And Bing

165
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,445
Speaker 4:  is, in addition to being a very capable search engine, it is

166
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:39,485
Speaker 4:  also a entire suite of mapping tools. So just

167
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:43,325
Speaker 4:  so you can go to Google Maps, you can go to Bing Maps and you can find

168
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:47,045
Speaker 4:  your way around. But Bing has done something a little bit more

169
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:50,885
Speaker 4:  aggressively than Google has and that is capturing

170
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:55,045
Speaker 4:  satellite information of the entire world.

171
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:59,645
Speaker 4:  And so what Microsoft and its partners at a Sobo

172
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:03,165
Speaker 4:  studio, a French studio that actually did a lot of the heavy lifting on Microsoft

173
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:06,725
Speaker 4:  Flight Simulator, what they were able to do is take,

174
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:11,085
Speaker 4:  I dunno if it's two or four or five petabytes

175
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:15,125
Speaker 4:  of this satellite data that it's getting

176
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,405
Speaker 4:  that Microsoft owns effectively as part of Bing Maps. And

177
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,765
Speaker 4:  then it bolted Microsoft Flight Simulator to this data.

178
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:27,245
Speaker 4:  So when folks received Microsoft Flight Simulator in the

179
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:30,925
Speaker 4:  mail, or when they downloaded the client, they were really only downloading

180
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:34,885
Speaker 4:  a tiny fraction of what they needed to run the game.

181
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:38,765
Speaker 4:  You get the, the app outlet, you get the client, you get, you get it started

182
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:42,125
Speaker 4:  up and then it starts downloading, I think it was

183
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:45,725
Speaker 4:  120 gigabytes on launch day. It was one of the largest

184
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:50,605
Speaker 4:  downloads on launch day that I had ever received. And

185
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:54,085
Speaker 4:  that was just the basic information. After you get that

186
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,845
Speaker 4:  120 gigabytes, then it starts streaming data directly

187
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:01,885
Speaker 4:  from Bing. So If you go, like, I went to Egypt to

188
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:06,125
Speaker 4:  be parked, you know, 2000 feet over the great pyramid at Giza.

189
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:09,325
Speaker 4:  It's streaming in satellite data,

190
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:13,525
Speaker 4:  photogrammetry information, all of this sophisticated information

191
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:17,485
Speaker 4:  from Bing Maps and putting it directly on the screen

192
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:21,245
Speaker 4:  in front of you using all kinds of technological

193
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:24,885
Speaker 4:  wizardry. And it's literally applying that satellite data

194
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:29,405
Speaker 4:  to other data sets that it's pulling in. It has

195
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:33,885
Speaker 4:  topographical information that it literally skins the

196
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:37,685
Speaker 4:  ground with satellite information at launch. It was really

197
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:40,445
Speaker 4:  weird. It looked kinda like there were rivers that were kinda crawling up

198
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,365
Speaker 4:  the sides of mountains. They hadn't quite gotten it dialed in

199
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,445
Speaker 4:  quite perfectly as the game has progressed since 2020.

200
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,685
Speaker 4:  That resolution, the, the difference between the topographical map

201
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:56,565
Speaker 4:  and the satellite data has become even better. You're literally

202
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:59,845
Speaker 4:  able to fly over the entire surface of the entire world.

203
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:04,005
Speaker 4:  And it looks like it does in bing maps.

204
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:07,485
Speaker 4:  It, it actually looks better because it's, it's putting in trees,

205
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:11,685
Speaker 4:  it's putting in houses, it's put, it's putting color on the

206
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,045
Speaker 4:  roofs of these houses and it's doing all of it automatically without really

207
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,205
Speaker 4:  any human intervention on that landscape. It's, it's really remarkable.

208
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:22,765
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I, I have wondered a couple times why the, the map companies,

209
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:26,725
Speaker 1:  the Google maps, the Apple Maps being don't just copy Flight Simulator

210
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:29,765
Speaker 1:  because it is that much just prettier looking

211
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:34,005
Speaker 1:  and more realistic than the 3D maps we get now. They

212
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:37,765
Speaker 4:  Go further than that though. They bring in real world air traffic. So

213
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:41,925
Speaker 4:  you are flying in the sky next to other planes that are

214
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:45,845
Speaker 4:  really in the real sky. They bring in real weather

215
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:50,005
Speaker 4:  data from actual weather data in real time. You

216
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:53,925
Speaker 4:  can actually bring in other players as well to act as like air traffic

217
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,805
Speaker 4:  controllers so that they can control the airports that you're flying around.

218
00:14:57,955 --> 00:15:01,445
Speaker 4:  It's, it's an incredible multilayered

219
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:03,365
Speaker 4:  multiplayer simulation.

220
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:07,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah, simulation is truly the only word for it.

221
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,005
Speaker 1:  Okay, I want to get into flight simulator peripherals, but first we're gonna

222
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:12,645
Speaker 1:  take a quick break to listen to some ads.

223
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:12,325
Speaker 1:  what maybe a, a typical gamer has with a 16 by nine

224
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:15,805
Speaker 1:  computer screen in front of them. What are some of the things that you've

225
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:19,605
Speaker 1:  heard about or maybe you've even personally tried to kind of

226
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:23,045
Speaker 1:  go beyond the 16 by nine box that

227
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,925
Speaker 1:  constraints a normal flight sim experience.

228
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:30,485
Speaker 4:  The most easy and frankly the most popular

229
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:35,005
Speaker 4:  next step is to go with multiple monitors. Some folks

230
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:38,925
Speaker 4:  will do two, but then you have that bezel kind of right in front of you there.

231
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:43,245
Speaker 4:  So the kind of the standard is three monitors. And so there

232
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:46,445
Speaker 4:  are companies that will make triple monitor arms

233
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:51,245
Speaker 4:  with the intent being that you tell the program, be

234
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:54,645
Speaker 4:  it Microsoft, Flight Simulator or xplan or star citizen, whatever you're

235
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:58,605
Speaker 4:  using, I have three monitors and then you kind of calibrate it in and

236
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:02,565
Speaker 4:  you've got a view out the front of the canopy on your middle monitor to

237
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:06,245
Speaker 4:  whatever degree works for you. A view out the left side of the canopy and

238
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:10,165
Speaker 4:  the right side of the canopy. And at its most fundamental, this lets

239
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:13,525
Speaker 4:  you do things like line up your approach when you're landing, when you're

240
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:17,445
Speaker 4:  making that final turn, you can see the runway, you can

241
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:21,045
Speaker 4:  time that turn appropriately without doing any crazy stuff with a hat, switch

242
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:23,845
Speaker 4:  your keyboard. So that is kind of the most typical

243
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:28,405
Speaker 4:  adaptation. The next step up from there is actually

244
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:32,445
Speaker 4:  my preferred way to fly and that's what something called the track IR

245
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:36,565
Speaker 4:  or track infrared. So If, you remember the we right?

246
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:40,685
Speaker 4:  The dearly departed Nintendo we, it had that remote control

247
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:44,445
Speaker 4:  and there was infrared emitter on the front of the remote control. Then

248
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:48,485
Speaker 4:  you'd put that bar up on the top of your TV and the bar would

249
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:52,125
Speaker 4:  track where you're pointing the we mode, right? Sure. Track IR works

250
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,485
Speaker 4:  basically the same way. You get three little

251
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:59,965
Speaker 4:  IR emitters, you clip those to your headset or you clip it to

252
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:03,845
Speaker 4:  your hat, you just make sure it's on your head. And then there is

253
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:07,525
Speaker 4:  a receiving panel that you put on the top of your middle monitor

254
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:11,725
Speaker 4:  and it just kind of sits there. And yeah, as you move your

255
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:15,565
Speaker 4:  head, the panel on your monitor can see how

256
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:19,405
Speaker 4:  those three points of light move in space and it interprets that

257
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:24,085
Speaker 4:  as head movement inside the game. So when I'm using

258
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:27,765
Speaker 4:  my track ir, I can just look ever so slightly to my left

259
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:32,165
Speaker 4:  in the calibration of the track ir it will accelerate my head

260
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:35,965
Speaker 4:  movement inside the game. So even though I'm still looking at my middle monitor

261
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:40,445
Speaker 4:  on the screen, what I'll be seeing is fully behind me. Very cool.

262
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:44,565
Speaker 4:  And so you can calibrate this to meet your needs for a number of

263
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:48,285
Speaker 4:  different games. I use it also for arm three. I used to use it for

264
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:52,325
Speaker 4:  Daisy and it gave me a neck, which is not something that you get in most

265
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:56,045
Speaker 4:  first person shooters. Tremendously helpful when you're looking down a gun

266
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:59,405
Speaker 4:  site to be able to look to the left, look to the right without taking that

267
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:03,005
Speaker 4:  gun off your shoulder. But in a flight simulator it's just

268
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:06,845
Speaker 4:  situational awareness and it's increasingly important when you're doing any

269
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,405
Speaker 4:  type of combat flying. So when I'm playing in elite

270
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:14,685
Speaker 4:  dangerous, it's very easy to lose my quarry to lose

271
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:17,645
Speaker 4:  my bogey, lose the thing that I'm trying to shoot at. And I can look around

272
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:21,965
Speaker 4:  really with my actual head and the view changes on

273
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:25,525
Speaker 4:  my screen and it is delightful an alternative

274
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:29,605
Speaker 4:  solution to that. And it's something that I've had less success with. It's

275
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,405
Speaker 4:  eye tracking technology. A company called Tobe does that, or

276
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:36,965
Speaker 4:  Tobi, I don't know how to pronounce that company correctly, but

277
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:41,285
Speaker 4:  it's more in line with the, the form factor of the old

278
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:44,405
Speaker 4:  we, it kind of sits on the bottom or the top of your monitor and it literally

279
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:48,365
Speaker 4:  looks at your eyes and as you move your eyes it changes the view

280
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:48,725
Speaker 4:  for you.

281
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:53,125
Speaker 1:  So it seems like Charlie peripheral vision in flight is

282
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:57,005
Speaker 1:  essential, right? Absolutely. So, you know, casual gamer like

283
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,845
Speaker 1:  myself, I can't help wondering why not just throw a VR headset on

284
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,365
Speaker 1:  your, on your face. Have you tried that at all?

285
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:06,605
Speaker 4:  I have. I have actually in Elite Dangerous, I traveled

286
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:10,805
Speaker 4:  from the bubble, which is the area right around the Saul system in

287
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:14,645
Speaker 4:  the unfashionable Western spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy.

288
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:18,485
Speaker 4:  And I went all the way across 65,000 plus light years to

289
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,365
Speaker 4:  Beagle Point, one of the furthest reaches in that game. And I spent four

290
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,925
Speaker 4:  months nightly making that trip and I did it all

291
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,965
Speaker 4:  in virtual reality with kind of, I think it was a launch Oculus,

292
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:31,125
Speaker 4:  if I remember correctly.

293
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:35,285
Speaker 1:  So you have a lot of experience in VR and I would imagine a very strong neck.

294
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:41,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah, it was, it was daunting man. Probably by two to four hours

295
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:45,765
Speaker 4:  per week night. Yeah, it was a lot of travel. I was doing probably like 80

296
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:49,485
Speaker 4:  jumps a night to try and get where I was going. Anybody who's played elite

297
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:52,925
Speaker 4:  knows that that's a lot of, a lot of, yeah, a lot of push in the throttle

298
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:56,045
Speaker 4:  back and forth. But I've also done it in Microsoft, Flight Simulator. I've

299
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:59,285
Speaker 4:  done it in, I've tried to do it in Star Citizen and I've done it in a few

300
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,325
Speaker 4:  other flight simulators as well.

301
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:04,765
Speaker 1:  Okay. Yeah, I mean a, as an apartment dweller, I'm looking around at my space

302
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:08,405
Speaker 1:  thinking, hmm, two or three screens that's that that'd be hard to fit on

303
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:12,125
Speaker 1:  my desk. But a VR headset seems, at least at first

304
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:16,005
Speaker 1:  thought to be the perfect solution for this. If I move my head up or

305
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:19,605
Speaker 1:  down left or right, it's, it's gonna show me what I would be

306
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:23,525
Speaker 1:  looking at in a cockpit. But there have to be some downsides of

307
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:27,045
Speaker 1:  it than the cost. Tell me about your, that four months in

308
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:28,965
Speaker 1:  vr, what was it like?

309
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:34,005
Speaker 4:  I mean, elite dangerous is a real pleasure

310
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:38,125
Speaker 4:  in VR and there's a reason for that. You're often

311
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:42,045
Speaker 4:  not looking at very much, it's, it's space Liam, there's a

312
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:45,845
Speaker 4:  planet, right? It's very far away. Looks like a star. There's a couple

313
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:50,005
Speaker 4:  thousand of those and, and that's it for the majority of your trip.

314
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:54,165
Speaker 4:  Now you get closer to a single celestial body, it's, it's very easy

315
00:22:54,345 --> 00:22:58,125
Speaker 4:  for that, you know, circa 2014 client

316
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:01,845
Speaker 4:  to get the, the visuals right as you're coming closer to it.

317
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:06,205
Speaker 4:  So rarely do I have issues with frame rate in elite dangerous

318
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,205
Speaker 4:  Microsoft Flight Simulator is real hard though. And we're talking about,

319
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:13,725
Speaker 4:  I think I had an I seven or an I 9 32 gigs of Ram

320
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:18,165
Speaker 4:  2060 card I was working with and Microsoft Flight Simulator was

321
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:21,565
Speaker 4:  still very challenging frame rate wise.

322
00:23:22,145 --> 00:23:25,445
Speaker 4:  And when you are flying, you do not want to

323
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:29,765
Speaker 4:  have a delay in your frame rates. You need to know where that

324
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:33,565
Speaker 4:  airplane is relative to air traffic around you relative to the ground, relative

325
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:37,445
Speaker 4:  to the runway at all times. So aside from just, you know,

326
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:41,645
Speaker 4:  the nausea that can be induced by the frames, lock it up

327
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:45,205
Speaker 4:  or skipping, not having that situational awareness is, is gonna end your

328
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:49,085
Speaker 4:  play through very quickly. But the other big issue that I had

329
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:53,445
Speaker 4:  on my trip to Beagle Point Elite Dangerous was, well I couldn't see the

330
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:57,325
Speaker 4:  keyboard and Elite Dangerous is unique. They actually

331
00:23:57,495 --> 00:24:00,885
Speaker 4:  model the ctech X 52

332
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:04,925
Speaker 4:  joystick into the game. And so it was a partnership

333
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:08,925
Speaker 4:  between Cytech recently purchased by Logitech and

334
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:12,445
Speaker 4:  Frontier Developments to put their product in the game. So I looked down

335
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:16,165
Speaker 4:  in real life at the CYTECH X 52, same controller I'm using in the game,

336
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:19,565
Speaker 4:  but it doesn't move the same way all the time because I have my

337
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:24,605
Speaker 4:  bindings set differently than the game is expecting me to have my

338
00:24:24,725 --> 00:24:28,285
Speaker 4:  binding sets. So when I use the rudder it shows my hand twisting. But

339
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:32,125
Speaker 4:  no, my feet are moving 'cause I have rudder pedals, so that's not one-to-one,

340
00:24:32,545 --> 00:24:35,925
Speaker 4:  but there's a lot of buttons in the cockpit and I need this keyboard in front

341
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:39,885
Speaker 4:  of me in order to hit those buttons. And so that

342
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:43,925
Speaker 4:  required a lot of remapping of the controller. I was able to

343
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:47,845
Speaker 4:  remap what I needed to do all those lightspeed jumps to do all the

344
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:51,445
Speaker 4:  landing, to do all the maneuvering to the

345
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:55,085
Speaker 4:  buttons on my warthog throttle and the buttons on

346
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:58,245
Speaker 4:  my wart hog. I think it's an F 16

347
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:03,125
Speaker 4:  stick that I swapped out for the traditional warthog stick. But I was

348
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:06,845
Speaker 4:  able to do everything I needed to do using the buttons on the

349
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:10,485
Speaker 4:  joystick, including reset the center of my vr. But I

350
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:14,445
Speaker 4:  couldn't shut down the game, I couldn't pause the game for that.

351
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:18,565
Speaker 4:  I had to take off the helmet, I had to look down at my keyboard and it, it

352
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:21,845
Speaker 4:  takes you out of the experience a little bit, but mostly it's a performance

353
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:25,525
Speaker 4:  issue. Like if those frames are not where you need them to be, it's a very

354
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:29,285
Speaker 4:  uncomfortable experience and it's, it's not productive frankly. It's

355
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:33,245
Speaker 4:  better I feel to have the higher frame rate to have it on a monitor

356
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:37,245
Speaker 4:  in front of you. And I prefer to use track IR over VR because

357
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:37,525
Speaker 4:  of that.

358
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:41,685
Speaker 1:  Well it seems like the community agrees with you. I watched

359
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:45,965
Speaker 1:  many, many hours of people excitedly trying out

360
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:49,485
Speaker 1:  headsets from the MedQuest three, the valve index

361
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:53,925
Speaker 1:  of course the HT C vi and one in particular stood

362
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:57,805
Speaker 1:  out to me that a lot of flight sim enthusiasts were excited about

363
00:25:57,915 --> 00:26:01,645
Speaker 1:  last year, which was the ax crystal. And it seems like

364
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:06,165
Speaker 1:  a very similar story to what we're seeing with even the Apple

365
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:10,005
Speaker 1:  Vision Pro, the kind of consumer focused version of one of these

366
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:13,685
Speaker 1:  VR headsets and that, you know, there's, there's a huge amount of

367
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:17,645
Speaker 1:  anticipation and excitement and then of course you get the thing and

368
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:20,845
Speaker 1:  you try it on and you, you see all the edge cases and

369
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:25,325
Speaker 1:  issues with it and you've now have this very expensive

370
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:29,725
Speaker 1:  device that you can strap to your head but you don't want to anymore. It

371
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:33,285
Speaker 1:  seems like, from what I'm gathering from the Flight sim

372
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:37,245
Speaker 1:  YouTube community is that a lot of people have tried these, these VR headsets

373
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:40,445
Speaker 1:  and gone back to that three monitor setup that you're talking about because

374
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:44,285
Speaker 1:  in the end that just still provides a better

375
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:46,365
Speaker 1:  experience. Is that, would you agree with that?

376
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:50,645
Speaker 4:  I would agree with that. It's absolutely been my experience. It's been my

377
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:54,405
Speaker 4:  experience in, you know, high-end flight sim YouTubers that

378
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:58,365
Speaker 4:  I follow. The folks like the Grim Reapers, the majority of

379
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:02,285
Speaker 4:  of their team I think does the, the one or two or three monitors set up

380
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:06,445
Speaker 4:  and so do the ground training centers for the F 35

381
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:10,565
Speaker 4:  and the F 22. Like when you look at the

382
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:14,765
Speaker 4:  military training regime for those latest generation fighters,

383
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:18,965
Speaker 4:  you know, it's a tactile experience for them. They

384
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:22,925
Speaker 4:  need to know that the buttons in the cockpit

385
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:26,685
Speaker 4:  are where the buttons are gonna be in the actual cockpit. And that's the

386
00:27:26,885 --> 00:27:30,845
Speaker 4:  majority I think of what they're training to. I need to hit this switch

387
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:35,285
Speaker 4:  without even looking at it. That's the work. And they should already know

388
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:38,485
Speaker 4:  how to fly the airplane by that point. But yeah,

389
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:42,325
Speaker 4:  technologically it, it seems to be a better experience just working with

390
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:42,725
Speaker 4:  screens.

391
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,845
Speaker 1:  Okay, we're gonna take another quick break then we'll get into whether VR

392
00:27:47,035 --> 00:27:49,645
Speaker 1:  will ever be the future of flight simulators. We'll be right back.

393
00:29:36,085 --> 00:29:39,925
Speaker 4:  simulators. And like the drawbacks to the human

394
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:43,765
Speaker 4:  physiology are real. I spent a lot of time,

395
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:48,165
Speaker 4:  for instance, reviewing Medal of Honor above and beyond, which was,

396
00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:52,085
Speaker 4:  you know, the, the re-imagining of EAs classic first

397
00:29:52,085 --> 00:29:55,925
Speaker 4:  person shooter. But for the Oculus Rift and review situations can be

398
00:29:56,125 --> 00:30:00,005
Speaker 4:  stressful. And so I had to spend about six, eight hours reviewing

399
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:03,885
Speaker 4:  this game under a time crunch for embargo. And Liam, I

400
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,605
Speaker 4:  was laid out for the rest of the week. Oh, I bet it had a

401
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:11,645
Speaker 4:  deep, deeply bad thing happen to my inner

402
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:15,525
Speaker 4:  ear and all of the things that kept me upright. And it was no low level

403
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:19,045
Speaker 4:  nausea that I was stuck with for like the better part of three days.

404
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:23,565
Speaker 4:  So I don't enjoy first person shooter

405
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:27,325
Speaker 4:  games, I don't enjoy Minecraft in vr. I, I was there at that press

406
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:31,285
Speaker 4:  event as well for Minecraft vr and it was not a pleasurable experience, but

407
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:35,125
Speaker 4:  flight simulators, they work for me. And

408
00:30:35,195 --> 00:30:38,725
Speaker 4:  I'll tell you why. Elite in particular has a

409
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:42,885
Speaker 4:  permanent horizon line in front of you. It is this transparent

410
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:47,165
Speaker 4:  dashboard piece that sits on the screen in front of you and it's a similar

411
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:50,725
Speaker 4:  thing with a flight simul. You've got that top of the cockpit

412
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:54,645
Speaker 4:  dashboard right there in front of you and it eases a lot of that motion

413
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:58,605
Speaker 4:  sickness for me. And that may not be true of everybody,

414
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:03,085
Speaker 4:  but actually having it on your head for more than an hour or

415
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:07,125
Speaker 4:  two does get to be taxing. I would come out

416
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,965
Speaker 4:  of my office after my trip to Beagle Point and the kids would make fun of

417
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:14,845
Speaker 4:  me because I'd have this trench down my bushy hair

418
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:18,725
Speaker 4:  on the top of my head. I'd have goggle marks on my face.

419
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:22,565
Speaker 4:  The tip of my nose would be red. 'cause I'm a six and a half foot tall human.

420
00:31:22,785 --> 00:31:26,765
Speaker 4:  And all of me doesn't quite fit inside of most VR helmets because of

421
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:30,685
Speaker 4:  that. But also, especially with something like, I've had a

422
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:34,445
Speaker 4:  lot of experience with the HTC Vive very heavy

423
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:38,325
Speaker 4:  on the front. When you're using the wireless set, there's a

424
00:31:38,325 --> 00:31:42,245
Speaker 4:  battery that you have to wear on your waist to get truly untethered

425
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:46,085
Speaker 4:  access to that platform. And it's just a lot of stuff that weighs you

426
00:31:46,085 --> 00:31:49,325
Speaker 4:  down and yeah, there's some fatigue on your neck. So I don't know,

427
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:53,445
Speaker 4:  it's, some headsets are better than others in my opinion,

428
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:57,365
Speaker 4:  but I mean, it's, it's certainly nothing like wearing a, a

429
00:31:57,645 --> 00:32:01,485
Speaker 4:  military style helmet for a long period of time. That is a weight

430
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:04,965
Speaker 4:  on your head, but it's, it's not the most comfortable thing either.

431
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:09,525
Speaker 4:  Microsoft Flighting leader does something really clever in this regard. You

432
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:13,045
Speaker 4:  can actually accelerate your flight, like you do the takeoff part, you can

433
00:32:13,045 --> 00:32:15,485
Speaker 4:  do the landing part and you just hit a couple of buttons and it takes that

434
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:19,005
Speaker 4:  whole middle part and just compresses it down to a couple of seconds. So

435
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:22,165
Speaker 4:  you're, you're doing the most active, the most engaging parts of the flight

436
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:25,725
Speaker 4:  during your time in vr and you don't have to, you know, do the Overland autopilot

437
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:27,685
Speaker 4:  section for four hours to get to la

438
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:30,965
Speaker 1:  Oh, that's very cool. I didn't know they they had that feature. That's nice.

439
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:35,325
Speaker 1:  So Charlie, as Microsoft continues to push the boundaries of

440
00:32:35,545 --> 00:32:39,470
Speaker 1:  what's possible with Flight Simulator making it feel

441
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:43,005
Speaker 1:  more and more realistic to what you'd experience in a real cockpit,

442
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:47,365
Speaker 1:  do you think that VR may come back into the fold? Or do you

443
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,925
Speaker 1:  think that the visual experience is best represented

444
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,805
Speaker 1:  by a wall of monitors kind of making you feel like you're inside a cockpit?

445
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:59,405
Speaker 4:  I am really excited about the

446
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:02,965
Speaker 4:  mixed reality work that I'm seeing out of the Apple VR

447
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:07,325
Speaker 4:  in particular. And here's why. When Microsoft

448
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:11,925
Speaker 4:  set out to make Flight Simulator and Flight Simulator 2024, the

449
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:15,125
Speaker 4:  latest edition of it, they worked very closely

450
00:33:15,715 --> 00:33:19,005
Speaker 4:  with aircraft manufacturers, with Boeing, with

451
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:23,285
Speaker 4:  Airbus, with folks like Icon. And what they've done is

452
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:27,005
Speaker 4:  they've actually baked into the game pre-flight

453
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:31,005
Speaker 4:  checklists and If, you go down those pre-flight checklists.

454
00:33:31,315 --> 00:33:35,085
Speaker 4:  Well, lo and behold, you can actually interact with all of

455
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:39,325
Speaker 4:  the gauges and dials and buttons and switches in the aircraft.

456
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:43,445
Speaker 4:  It is a hot dashboard in front of you. You

457
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:47,365
Speaker 4:  need merely point your face down with your track ir use

458
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:51,125
Speaker 4:  your mouse to reach out and click those switches. But I look

459
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:55,005
Speaker 4:  forward to a day where there's some kind of mixed reality

460
00:33:55,025 --> 00:33:58,845
Speaker 4:  in front of me where I can see my hand or a vision of my hand

461
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:02,725
Speaker 4:  and I can reach that hand out and I can touch this virtual

462
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:06,445
Speaker 4:  dashboard in front of me and change the altitude setting and

463
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:10,405
Speaker 4:  switch to the other gas tank and I can lower the

464
00:34:10,405 --> 00:34:14,365
Speaker 4:  landing gear really with my hands virtually rather than using

465
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,645
Speaker 4:  the keyboard. But I don't have a good

466
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:21,125
Speaker 4:  expectation that that is gonna happen anytime soon

467
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:25,445
Speaker 4:  because there are better cheaper solutions

468
00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:29,285
Speaker 4:  like monitors and keyboards out there. I don't know that there is enough

469
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:34,445
Speaker 4:  desire, enough of an audience really to make that happen,

470
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,605
Speaker 4:  but I, I can see how it could work. Does that make sense?

471
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:41,805
Speaker 1:  That makes perfect sense And, and honestly, mixed reality is

472
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:45,965
Speaker 1:  probably the perfect technology. It's exciting to see some of, some of the

473
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:49,725
Speaker 1:  things we can do now with them. But what I'm really excited about is,

474
00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:53,605
Speaker 1:  is where, you know, of course it's the joke that right VR is just a few years

475
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:57,565
Speaker 1:  away or you know, this is the year of Linux on the

476
00:34:57,565 --> 00:35:00,805
Speaker 1:  desktop. So many of those in, in the technology world. But it really does

477
00:35:00,805 --> 00:35:04,765
Speaker 1:  feel like we've gotten to a point now where we can comfortably

478
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:08,525
Speaker 1:  say mixed reality will eventually get to a point that can

479
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:12,045
Speaker 1:  offer us some experiences that we just, we can't pull off right now.

480
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:12,685
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

481
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,765
Speaker 4:  And just like they have the capacity to stream in new satellite

482
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:20,445
Speaker 4:  data or new weather data, I'm confident that a OBO and, and

483
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,605
Speaker 4:  Microsoft have the capability to, to add that in there too because

484
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:28,365
Speaker 4:  they've got those dashboards, those cockpits that, that really do have working

485
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:30,365
Speaker 4:  switches really do work like the real thing.

486
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Ooh, it's very exciting. My third grade

487
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:38,445
Speaker 1:  self, just hoping and wishing for a computer to one day run flight

488
00:35:38,545 --> 00:35:42,245
Speaker 1:  sim has been reignited I'm very excited about, about this future.

489
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:45,325
Speaker 1:  So we'll have to have you back to try those, those new things when they,

490
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:46,285
Speaker 1:  when they finally come out.

491
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:50,325
Speaker 4:  I can't wait. I will be there and ready to fly. Let's do it.

492
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:52,685
Speaker 1:  Charlie, thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you

493
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:53,725
Speaker 4:  Liam. This was a blast.

494
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:59,685
Speaker 3:  Thank you Liam. Thank you Charlie, thank you to everybody who listened to

495
00:35:59,685 --> 00:36:03,405
Speaker 3:  this show. That is it for The. Vergecast for today. I honestly

496
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:06,205
Speaker 3:  believe I'm about to go buy a bunch of new monitors. I don't even really

497
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:10,085
Speaker 3:  know that I'm a flight simulator guy. I've dabbled with it in the past.

498
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:13,765
Speaker 3:  I also at one point got very excited about a Formula one simulator.

499
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:18,365
Speaker 3:  That's a whole thing. But at some point in this episode, I just looked at

500
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:21,805
Speaker 3:  my one monitor and I'm like, this isn't enough. It's time. Anyway,

501
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:25,765
Speaker 3:  thank you as always for listening. This is the last episode in our Five

502
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:29,485
Speaker 3:  Senses of Gaming series, but we will be back with more special content for

503
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:33,085
Speaker 3:  you really soon. We have some more fun series coming up between now and the

504
00:36:33,085 --> 00:36:36,525
Speaker 3:  end of the year. It's gonna be great. As always. There is lots more to read

505
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:40,525
Speaker 3:  on gaming and everything going on in tech at The Verge dot com. It's a

506
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:44,165
Speaker 3:  website, we like it a bunch. This show is produced by Liam James Wil Pour

507
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:46,965
Speaker 3:  and Andrew Marino. The Vergecast is The Verge production and part of the

508
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:50,605
Speaker 3:  Vox Media podcast network. We'll be back on Tuesday to talk about Microsoft

509
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:54,605
Speaker 3:  PCs, the Smart Home, and a whole bunch of other stuff. We'll see you then.

510
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,365
Speaker 3:  Rock and roll
