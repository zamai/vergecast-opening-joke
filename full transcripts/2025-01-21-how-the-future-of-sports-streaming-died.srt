Description: First in this episode, a quick update on the TikTok ban (which didn't turn out to be much of a ban at all.) Then, Sportico's Jacob Feldman joins the show to talk about Venu, the much-hyped streaming service that planned to bring all sports into a single platform — and never even managed to launch. After that, The Verge's Kevin Nguyen tells us how to read more books this year, and how to turn all your aimless scrolling time into more productive reading time. Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline about audio sources on your phone, and why you can't listen to a thousand things at once.


2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:06,755
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Qualified

3
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:10,595
Speaker 1:  Divestiture. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and it has been a wild

4
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:14,515
Speaker 1:  weekend here in the United States. We kept a

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,635
Speaker 1:  lot of this episode sort of fluid until the very last minute, wanting to

6
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:21,555
Speaker 1:  see what happened with the TikTok ban and with President Trump's

7
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:25,435
Speaker 1:  inauguration. There's just a lot going on kind of minute to minute right

8
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:28,995
Speaker 1:  now. We've covered a lot of this in the run up to it, but a lot happened

9
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,675
Speaker 1:  kind of in the span of 36 hours

10
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:35,935
Speaker 1:  or, or, or did anything happen in the course of 36 hours?

11
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:40,175
Speaker 1:  So let me just level set where we are with TikTok kind of right this minute.

12
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:45,215
Speaker 1:  TikTok went into essentially darkness on

13
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:49,695
Speaker 1:  Saturday night into Sunday when the ban took effect. That didn't have to

14
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:53,575
Speaker 1:  happen. The, the rules around banning TikTok didn't necessarily mean that

15
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:57,335
Speaker 1:  TikTok had to just shut off in the US at midnight on Saturday

16
00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:01,255
Speaker 1:  night, but that's what TikTok did. Pretty performatively I

17
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:04,535
Speaker 1:  would say. The company put up a message basically saying, we think President

18
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:08,175
Speaker 1:  Trump is going to save us. It it, it's all just kind of naked

19
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:11,135
Speaker 1:  political maneuvering, like, let's just call this what it is that is pure

20
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:14,935
Speaker 1:  politicking. But anyway, TikTok gone for a little while

21
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:19,175
Speaker 1:  and then came back in a certain way. It's actually still

22
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:22,775
Speaker 1:  not available, at least as I'm checking right now, midday Monday

23
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:27,095
Speaker 1:  on either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store, but,

24
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,875
Speaker 1:  but you can go to TikTok dot com and watch TikTok isn. Essentially what it

25
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,555
Speaker 1:  appears we've seen is Oracle and Akamai, which are two of the

26
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:39,555
Speaker 1:  companies that host TikTok in the United States, basically

27
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:43,235
Speaker 1:  seem to believe that whatever President Trump is going to do, it's not going

28
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:47,195
Speaker 1:  to come back on them negatively. It's a risk to keep TikTok live right now

29
00:01:47,195 --> 00:01:49,795
Speaker 1:  because TikTok is technically banned in the United States, and any company

30
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:53,635
Speaker 1:  that hosts it or hosts it on its app store can be fined.

31
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:57,435
Speaker 1:  Trump has said he is not going to do that. It's still a risk, but the hosts

32
00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:01,275
Speaker 1:  seem to believe it's gonna be okay. The app store's TBD,

33
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:05,355
Speaker 1:  meanwhile Blue Sky launched a video thing that looks a lot like

34
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,315
Speaker 1:  TikTok. The X launched a video thing that looks a lot like TikTok, Adam

35
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:13,475
Speaker 1:  Ariat Instagram said the edit app that the company has been working on for

36
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:16,755
Speaker 1:  a while, which is essentially just a rip off of TikTok, isn CapCut editing

37
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:20,475
Speaker 1:  app is coming soon. So all at once, there is this question of

38
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:24,515
Speaker 1:  is TikTok going to continue to be around? The answer

39
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:28,435
Speaker 1:  seems to be yes in some way. Trump said it a

40
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:32,235
Speaker 1:  rally on Sunday, right before he was inaugurated, that he has a big plan

41
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,155
Speaker 1:  to save TikTok. That involves making it a joint venture with the United States

42
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,835
Speaker 1:  government, which doesn't make a lot of sense and doesn't have anything to

43
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:39,795
Speaker 1:  do with the law that has been passed.

44
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:45,555
Speaker 1:  We are in unprecedented political times, especially as it pertains

45
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:49,435
Speaker 1:  to the tech industry. So I frankly could

46
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,555
Speaker 1:  not handicap the likelihood of any of this happening or not happening or

47
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:56,395
Speaker 1:  how it might go down. But what I will say is that a lot happened

48
00:02:56,495 --> 00:03:00,165
Speaker 1:  and also not that much happened. We had a a lot of backing and forthing,

49
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:03,645
Speaker 1:  a lot of feelings. I think it's gonna be really interesting to see if even

50
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:07,925
Speaker 1:  like 12 hours of TikTok being turned off changes the way

51
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:11,765
Speaker 1:  that people perceive the platform even now as Trump continues to promise

52
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:14,605
Speaker 1:  to bring it back, and he really wants that as a political victory. The Biden

53
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:18,285
Speaker 1:  administration just like walked away. It's all very weird, and I could talk

54
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:22,125
Speaker 1:  about the machinations here forever, but I kind of don't want to, and I think

55
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:26,485
Speaker 1:  right now, again, as I'm recording this, we are in the middle of Donald Trump's

56
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:29,605
Speaker 1:  inauguration speech. He's officially, once again the president of the United States.

57
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:34,205
Speaker 1:  There's a lot of stuff to come in the next few days. Trump has said to

58
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:38,165
Speaker 1:  donors that he's planning to sign as many as a hundred executive orders like

59
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:42,125
Speaker 1:  today, Monday, and that there's going to be more to come with

60
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:45,805
Speaker 1:  TikTok very quickly. So I think what we're gonna do, just to bring this all

61
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:48,645
Speaker 1:  the way back around to The Vergecast, is we're gonna talk a lot about all

62
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,525
Speaker 1:  of that on Friday. I promise we're not gonna spend this whole year

63
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:56,365
Speaker 1:  talking about politics, but this moment, a lot of this stuff

64
00:03:56,385 --> 00:04:00,285
Speaker 1:  is coming to a head, and I think this moment matters and is going to set

65
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:04,085
Speaker 1:  up a lot of what's gonna happen for the next four years. I mean, mark

66
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:08,005
Speaker 1:  Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, and Sundar Phai and Shuchu, the CEO

67
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:11,845
Speaker 1:  of TikTok, isn, Tim Cook, and others are all at the

68
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:15,605
Speaker 1:  inauguration, Joe Rogan. I saw a picture of him in church with Trump this

69
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:19,405
Speaker 1:  morning. Like this connection between Washington and Silicon

70
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,245
Speaker 1:  Valley is closer and different than anything we've

71
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:26,805
Speaker 1:  experienced. And it is going to change a lot of things, but I don't think

72
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:30,125
Speaker 1:  we know what they are yet. And so we're just gonna try to kind of take it

73
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:34,085
Speaker 1:  as it comes rather than having a lot of insane ideas

74
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:37,805
Speaker 1:  about what might happen when I don't really think anything

75
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:40,485
Speaker 1:  we've seen before tells us what's coming next.

76
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:45,245
Speaker 1:  So here on The Vergecast today, we are going to stop talking about all of

77
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:48,605
Speaker 1:  that, and we're gonna do two different things. We first, we're gonna talk

78
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,485
Speaker 1:  to Jacob Feldman From Sportico about Venu Sports, which

79
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:56,405
Speaker 1:  was supposed to be this like future of sports streaming app that died

80
00:04:56,585 --> 00:05:00,405
Speaker 1:  before it ever even launched it. It went 90 on the go, 90 scale

81
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:05,205
Speaker 1:  at maybe record time, like maybe we need to rename the Go 90 Scale,

82
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,205
Speaker 1:  the venue scale. That's the thing we're gonna have to talk about. But he's

83
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,885
Speaker 1:  gonna come on and he's gonna tell us the story and explain what happened,

84
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:14,565
Speaker 1:  and just sort of lead us through what this means for streaming for sports,

85
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:18,725
Speaker 1:  and for the Go 90 scale. After that, we're gonna talk to Kevin Nguyen

86
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:22,645
Speaker 1:  about reading. So I'm gonna do two things over the next

87
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:26,205
Speaker 1:  two weeks, kind of about New Year's resolutions and the two that I hear from

88
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:29,725
Speaker 1:  people over and over again. People wanna stop scrolling and start reading

89
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,525
Speaker 1:  like books and articles and like deep reading instead of just kind of aimlessly

90
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:37,085
Speaker 1:  scrolling, Reddit and TikTok or whatever. So we're gonna talk to Kevin about

91
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:41,085
Speaker 1:  how he does that. Kevin reads more and better and more carefully than anybody

92
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:44,485
Speaker 1:  I know and has also thought deeply about how to be good at that in a digital

93
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:48,285
Speaker 1:  world. So we're gonna just try and see if we can learn anything from how

94
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:52,165
Speaker 1:  Kevin gets all of this stuff done. We also have a hotline, lots to

95
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:55,645
Speaker 1:  get to. This is a very fun episode, and we are done talking about politics,

96
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:58,060
Speaker 1:  at least for today. We're gonna come, come back and try to make sense of

97
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,885
Speaker 1:  all of this on Friday's show because I think with a few days of settling

98
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:05,085
Speaker 1:  and a few days of the Trump presidency, we're gonna have a better sense of

99
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:08,925
Speaker 1:  where we really are. So we're gonna come back to that for now. We got

100
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:12,045
Speaker 1:  other stuff to do. All that is coming up in just a second, But first we gotta

101
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:15,885
Speaker 1:  take a break because I've been talking for too long and now I

102
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:18,925
Speaker 1:  need to go not think about politics for a while. This is The Vergecast. We'll

103
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:19,245
Speaker 1:  be right back.

104
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:50,995
Speaker 3:  toyota.com/toyota Crown Family Toyota.

105
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:23,355
Speaker 5:  Visit schwab.com to learn more.

106
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:47,775
Speaker 1:  All right, so the other thing that happened this weekend was that it was

107
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:51,735
Speaker 1:  a pretty good sports weekend. There was a lot of good football. It's the

108
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:54,975
Speaker 1:  college football National Championship. It's the NFL playoffs.

109
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:59,215
Speaker 1:  Basketball is kind of coming into full form, like it's a, this is a fun part

110
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:03,105
Speaker 1:  of the sports calendar, but it's a crappy time to be a

111
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:06,825
Speaker 1:  sports fan in a lot of ways because watching those games seems to get more

112
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:10,665
Speaker 1:  complicated and more expensive all the time. But there was supposed

113
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:14,545
Speaker 1:  to be a better way coming already. It was gonna be called Venu

114
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:18,505
Speaker 1:  Sports, and it was going to be the one place you needed to be

115
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:22,225
Speaker 1:  to watch all of your sports in one place. It was gonna be pretty expensive,

116
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:25,465
Speaker 1:  but it was gonna solve a certain set of problems, I think.

117
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:29,705
Speaker 1:  And then it died before it ever lived. So I wanna

118
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:33,345
Speaker 1:  understand what happened here. So I called up Jacob Feldman, who's a reporter

119
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:37,065
Speaker 1:  at Sportico, who has been covering this whole saga from beginning

120
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:41,225
Speaker 1:  to end, which is both a lot of work and a very small amount of time

121
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:45,225
Speaker 1:  because boy, boy did venue come and go really fast.

122
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:49,345
Speaker 1:  So Jacob is gonna take us through what happened, what we can learn, and

123
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:53,865
Speaker 1:  what 2025 might hold for sports fans. Let's get into it.

124
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:57,345
Speaker 1:  Jacob Feldman, welcome To The Vergecast. Let's just start at the beginning

125
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,825
Speaker 1:  of the venue story. The story is both really complicated and not very long,

126
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:05,905
Speaker 1:  so we're gonna try to kind of tell the whole thing here. So go all the way

127
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:08,665
Speaker 1:  back to the beginning and tell me kind of where venue came from.

128
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:13,375
Speaker 7:  Sure. Venue came out of nowhere, I think as a, as a good place to start here.

129
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:16,775
Speaker 7:  Last February, almost exactly a year ago.

130
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:21,495
Speaker 7:  It, it was I think an afternoon press release from Warner Brothers,

131
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:24,935
Speaker 7:  discovery Fox and, and Disney that they were creating this joint venture.

132
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:28,455
Speaker 7:  We can talk about what that means to launch the service. Didn't have a name,

133
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:32,135
Speaker 7:  didn't have a CEO, didn't have a price, never had a price. We'll get to that

134
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:36,535
Speaker 7:  and everyone was kind of wondering what this is

135
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:40,175
Speaker 7:  and, and we got a little bit of detail on a Fox earnings call, but it was

136
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:43,095
Speaker 7:  a lot of questions, you know, within the industry of, of, obviously there's

137
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:46,455
Speaker 7:  huge companies coming together to create some sort of sports service. And,

138
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:49,255
Speaker 7:  and again, it started with a lot of questions, if I

139
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:53,535
Speaker 1:  Remember right. The only thing we kind of knew from that

140
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:56,775
Speaker 1:  first release was like, this is a thing that is going to have a lot of sports.

141
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:57,655
Speaker 7:  Yes.

142
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:00,815
Speaker 1:  Right. I think it was, it was really, it was that vague that it was just

143
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:04,495
Speaker 1:  like, this is, we knew the three companies and we knew that they have a lot

144
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:06,775
Speaker 1:  of sports, and that was, that was kind of it.

145
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:10,815
Speaker 7:  Yes. Right. And, and ev obviously everybody knew that sports

146
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:14,335
Speaker 7:  and the way we watch sports is changing and these companies are figuring

147
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:17,215
Speaker 7:  out, they're constantly having these carriage battles. They're constantly

148
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:20,895
Speaker 7:  debating moving to streaming or not moving to streaming. Every company's

149
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:24,615
Speaker 7:  a little bit different and this was maybe gonna solve some of those problems

150
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:28,335
Speaker 7:  and not others. And maybe each company had slightly different priorities.

151
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,135
Speaker 7:  I think that all contributed to the vagueness of it. And we got some answers

152
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:35,655
Speaker 7:  over time. Some, again, questions maybe We'll, we'll, we'll never completely

153
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:35,935
Speaker 7:  know.

154
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:40,255
Speaker 1:  So put yourself in the, the shoes of, of these three companies. And

155
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,015
Speaker 1:  let's see, it was, it was Warner Brothers, discovery, ESPN and Fox,

156
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:46,815
Speaker 1:  right? Were the three Disney, espn. Yeah. Yeah. Disney,

157
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:48,095
Speaker 7:  Espn. Exactly. Yeah.

158
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:52,015
Speaker 1:  What do, what do you think, like, rewind six months before that, what do

159
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:54,895
Speaker 1:  you think these companies saw in each other that was like, this is a thing

160
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:55,615
Speaker 1:  we can do that'll work.

161
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:59,175
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think they each saw something slightly different. I think Fox the

162
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:02,255
Speaker 7:  simplest one to start with here, because Fox does not have a streaming service.

163
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:06,215
Speaker 7:  They have, they have Tubi, I think. So it, you know, it's a free service.

164
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:10,175
Speaker 7:  They don't put their live sports there, right? And So I think they were

165
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:13,975
Speaker 7:  looking for a way to reach fans who don't have cable, who

166
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:17,015
Speaker 7:  don't have even antennas in, in some cases.

167
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:20,735
Speaker 7:  And, and so looking for a streaming service streaming partner, I think that's

168
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:24,975
Speaker 7:  what, what brought them to the table. Then you go to Warner Brothers Discovery,

169
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:28,695
Speaker 7:  you guys talk a lot about them a lot on the show. David Zla is always, we're

170
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:30,215
Speaker 1:  Big fans here on the first cast. Huge

171
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:34,135
Speaker 7:  Fans. Yeah. For some reason. And he's always

172
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:37,815
Speaker 7:  clearly looking for ways to continue to monetize to, to, to make balance

173
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:41,375
Speaker 7:  the balance sheet, to look for ways to make money off the rights they have

174
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,535
Speaker 7:  and potentially continue to, to gain rights. Obviously, at the time, again,

175
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,215
Speaker 7:  going back a year, they still had BA rights and were still negotiating

176
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:52,695
Speaker 7:  for BA rights. We can talk about how that played out. And, and So I think

177
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:56,525
Speaker 7:  they saw, oh, another service, another place where we can reach fans, a slightly

178
00:11:56,525 --> 00:12:00,405
Speaker 7:  different price point, ideally we're in. And

179
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:02,885
Speaker 7:  then you get to ESPN Disney, which is the most complicated, we'll probably

180
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:06,565
Speaker 7:  spend the most time talking about what they're doing and why.

181
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:11,045
Speaker 7:  And for me, I think what probably brought them to

182
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:15,245
Speaker 7:  do this deal is they're at this crucial moment for E-S-P-N-E-S-P-N

183
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,325
Speaker 7:  long, the dominant sports broadcaster in America is

184
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:22,405
Speaker 7:  reaching, is still the dominant sports broadcaster in America, but slightly

185
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:25,725
Speaker 7:  less so, a lot more doubt and uncertainty about what its future looks like,

186
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:29,925
Speaker 7:  how people are going to watch. And as we enter 2025, I think what

187
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:33,205
Speaker 7:  we're seeing is that they're gonna try to a lot of different things over

188
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:36,085
Speaker 7:  these next years, these next couple years. How much do you wanna pay? You

189
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:40,005
Speaker 7:  wanna spend five bucks, 50 bucks, $500? We'll have an ESPN package for you.

190
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:42,845
Speaker 7:  We see tech companies do this all the time. Right? And, and So I think they're

191
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,325
Speaker 7:  trying to figure out exactly what that looks like, the ability to partner

192
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:48,365
Speaker 7:  with these other companies, try something a little different, I think. Said,

193
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:50,165
Speaker 7:  yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll sign up for this and see where it goes.

194
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:54,565
Speaker 1:  Okay. So knowing what you know now, this was not going to

195
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,685
Speaker 1:  work. Spoiler alert didn't work. Yes.

196
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:01,085
Speaker 1:  Did you think this idea made sense when it first happened? Like just to lay

197
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:03,525
Speaker 1:  my own cards on the table, I thought this was gonna work. There, there were,

198
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,605
Speaker 1:  there were problems that we should talk about,

199
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:11,125
Speaker 1:  but this as a, as a theory of the case about like, here is

200
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,925
Speaker 1:  what sports fans want and might be willing to pay for this tracked for me.

201
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:15,685
Speaker 1:  Did it track for you?

202
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,925
Speaker 7:  Interesting. I thought this was gonna work on a much smaller scale than I

203
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:22,525
Speaker 7:  think some people either anticipated or feared. Okay. I think,

204
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:26,365
Speaker 7:  again, once it became slightly clear what this product was, which was gonna

205
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:29,885
Speaker 7:  be a monthly streaming service, roughly 30 to

206
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:33,765
Speaker 7:  $50 a month to start, probably going up After that. And

207
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:37,525
Speaker 7:  including, like you said, all the sports channels from these three companies,

208
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,725
Speaker 7:  which is a lot of sports channels. I think depending on how you do the math,

209
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:43,205
Speaker 7:  it's like more than half of of the major sports would be available here.

210
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:47,885
Speaker 7:  So again, what you're getting is most sports for slightly less than you would

211
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:50,365
Speaker 7:  pay for cable. And in my mind you're,

212
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:54,205
Speaker 1:  When you put it like that, that's not very compelling. Yeah.

213
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:57,285
Speaker 7:  In, in my mind, the audience is either somebody who needs all the sports

214
00:13:57,285 --> 00:14:00,565
Speaker 7:  and is willing to spend 80 to a hundred dollars a month, or somebody who

215
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:04,245
Speaker 7:  needs only some of the sports and wants to spend 10 to $20 a month. So again,

216
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:08,445
Speaker 7:  this kind of middle product, I think probably would've maybe gotten a couple

217
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:11,805
Speaker 7:  million subscribers, something like that. Obviously very seasonal when you

218
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:14,925
Speaker 7:  talk about the college football audience, maybe they're signing up to, to

219
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:17,885
Speaker 7:  watch their teams in September, October until their teams four and six and

220
00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:21,565
Speaker 7:  they're, they're churning out. And, and so it would've been, it would've

221
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:24,045
Speaker 7:  been marginal. And, and that's what always I I I'm curious kind of what your

222
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:27,565
Speaker 7:  reaction was, because to me, I was, I'm, I still am kind of surprised at

223
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:31,005
Speaker 7:  how much interest there was in the venue story, given that kind of middle

224
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:31,645
Speaker 7:  of the road nature.

225
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:36,095
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think to me it's, it's, it pokes

226
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:39,175
Speaker 1:  at the right thing, right? Which is that watching sports, there's a problem

227
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:43,015
Speaker 1:  here, right? Watching sports is, is a disaster. Yes. Like it has never been

228
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:47,215
Speaker 1:  worse or more complicated or, or frankly, more expensive Yes.

229
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:50,935
Speaker 1:  To watch all the sports you wanna watch. I think like if, If you want,

230
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:54,225
Speaker 1:  even If you want the NFL, right? Like if, if I wanna watch all the football

231
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,985
Speaker 1:  games, that's like four services that I have to pay for.

232
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,905
Speaker 7:  At the beginning of the year, I calculated spent $800 to watch every NFL

233
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:00,345
Speaker 7:  game this year.

234
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,705
Speaker 1:  That's nuts. Yeah. Like that is bad. Yeah. And I think

235
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:07,665
Speaker 1:  for, for all of the stuff that we're going through in this like unbundling

236
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:11,105
Speaker 1:  and rebundling thing, like, we're just doing cable again. Right? And So I

237
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:14,705
Speaker 1:  think the idea that we could do cable again,

238
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:19,585
Speaker 1:  but mostly for sports, would've worked for me. And obviously I

239
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,545
Speaker 1:  think like the, the main limitation is what you're saying, like, it, it had

240
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:25,425
Speaker 1:  something like half the sports, right? It didn't have any of the things that

241
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,545
Speaker 1:  Comcast had, which turns out to be a lot of things that a lot of people care

242
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:32,505
Speaker 1:  about, like the Olympics, it didn't have some of the football, because Amazon

243
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:33,825
Speaker 1:  had football and Netflix had football

244
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:35,185
Speaker 7:  And CBS as well. Yes. Right?

245
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:39,145
Speaker 1:  And CBS was pro, CBS was probably the biggest single holdout. It

246
00:15:39,145 --> 00:15:42,265
Speaker 1:  had college basketball, it has more football, all this stuff. Yeah. Right.

247
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:45,865
Speaker 1:  So I it like, if, If you could have put

248
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:50,265
Speaker 1:  together all of the things, this thing makes sense. Yeah.

249
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:53,625
Speaker 1:  And I think people would pay slightly less than cable for all of the sports,

250
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,945
Speaker 1:  right. I think there's an actual market for that. But

251
00:15:57,405 --> 00:16:01,025
Speaker 1:  the more it became clear that it was half the sports for slightly less than

252
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:04,305
Speaker 1:  the price of cable, it, it kind of started to fall apart. But I still think

253
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,225
Speaker 1:  there is something you could do with sports

254
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:13,505
Speaker 1:  If you do more than just the games. That could be

255
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,945
Speaker 1:  interesting. And, and, and this is where we're gonna go back to ES, espn,

256
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:20,105
Speaker 1:  which is trying to very much be that thing that we should talk about. Right.

257
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:24,465
Speaker 1:  But that was the case, at least in my head, is like, I can see the, the glimmer

258
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:25,065
Speaker 1:  of something here.

259
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:29,105
Speaker 7:  Right. And, and I think one of the questions right away, going back to when

260
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:32,105
Speaker 7:  this launch was, all right, who's in this, you know, it's Fox, Disney, Warner

261
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:34,345
Speaker 7:  Brothers adding up all those channels, and then who's not in this? You know,

262
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:37,345
Speaker 7:  you have your NBC, you have your CBS, you have your regional sports networks,

263
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:41,265
Speaker 7:  which which we can talk about too. And, and yeah, I think I, I

264
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:44,465
Speaker 7:  totally agree that the excitement was based on the recognition that there

265
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:47,625
Speaker 7:  is a problem here and maybe this will solve it even though the past a hundred

266
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:51,465
Speaker 7:  attempts to solve it have not worked. Maybe this is the one, but yeah, even

267
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:55,225
Speaker 7:  I could do the math and say, okay, this is $45 and then, what is it, $7 for

268
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:59,065
Speaker 7:  peacock and then $6 for Paramount to get the CBS and then 15 for

269
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:02,025
Speaker 7:  Amazon. I'm already paying that anyway. And so maybe I can bundle this together

270
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,665
Speaker 7:  and save 15 bucks a month, which would be great. I'll, I'll do it. Which

271
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:08,025
Speaker 7:  then we get to the fragmentation every year. People in the sports world now

272
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:11,625
Speaker 7:  celebrate this thing called the Sports Equinox, which is one of the nerdier

273
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,425
Speaker 7:  things that we do in the sports world where we don't, you know, all hold

274
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:18,345
Speaker 7:  hands and, and go full mid, some are, but on one Monday in October,

275
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:22,825
Speaker 7:  all four of the major men's American team sports are playing. And,

276
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:26,665
Speaker 7:  and so that was a good occasion. I I think this October, those games plus

277
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:30,065
Speaker 7:  some golf were spread across 39 channels and services.

278
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:34,225
Speaker 1:  Oh my God. Yeah. So this is why I actually think the, the

279
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:38,305
Speaker 1:  part of the reason for the excitement behind venue was less about the

280
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:41,905
Speaker 1:  reality of what venue could even possibly be, and more just the

281
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:43,665
Speaker 1:  recognition that thank God somebody

282
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:44,425
Speaker 7:  Right

283
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:47,185
Speaker 1:  In charge understands that this sucks. Excuse me.

284
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:50,245
Speaker 7:  Yes. And flipping the remote and signing in a million times. Yeah. Right.

285
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:54,165
Speaker 1:  And I think what we've learned is that the, the leagues, which in theory

286
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:58,005
Speaker 1:  have the most weight to make some of these changes.

287
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:01,485
Speaker 1:  Like if the NFL just wanted to sell all of its rights to one player, and

288
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:04,325
Speaker 1:  everybody would be happy it could do that, it's never gonna do that because

289
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:07,605
Speaker 1:  there's more money in selling it to more and more people all the time. That's

290
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:10,925
Speaker 1:  how Netflix gets games on Christmas, right? Yep. Like, th that is where we're

291
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:14,245
Speaker 1:  headed. And so our only hope as fans, it seems,

292
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:18,725
Speaker 1:  is for somebody on the other end to figure it out for us. And

293
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:22,205
Speaker 1:  as somebody who just doesn't wanna admit that it's impossible, and it might

294
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:25,725
Speaker 1:  just be impossible, there was something about venue that it was like, okay,

295
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:29,645
Speaker 1:  at least, at least this is somebody with some power pushing back in the right

296
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:30,325
Speaker 1:  direction of this.

297
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:32,485
Speaker 7:  Is this where we can introduce the Fuo character?

298
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,965
Speaker 1:  This is where, where we bring in Fuo, because Fuo said, no thank you.

299
00:18:36,555 --> 00:18:40,325
Speaker 7:  Well, a little background on Fuo and I know you, you've covered it and, and

300
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:43,925
Speaker 7:  written about them too. So they started, they turned 10 this month, and they

301
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:47,725
Speaker 7:  started in January, 2015 with the same problem

302
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:51,725
Speaker 7:  in mind, watching sports online sucks, how do we make

303
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:55,205
Speaker 7:  it better? And for nine

304
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:59,645
Speaker 7:  and years and 11 months, that was more branding than product, right?

305
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:02,245
Speaker 7:  Because their service ended up looking very similar to every other service

306
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:05,525
Speaker 7:  that's out there. It's a hundred channels for a hundred bucks, more or less.

307
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:10,365
Speaker 1:  They just had some like clever UI stuff around sports, which was fine and

308
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:13,765
Speaker 1:  good, but Yeah. But yeah, it was, they were essentially, they were more like

309
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:17,005
Speaker 1:  a YouTube TV competitor than a Exactly. ESPN competitor. Exactly.

310
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:20,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So this announcement comes out, we're talking about our reaction to,

311
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:23,805
Speaker 7:  to this news. This was their reaction. Wait, what we've been trying to do

312
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:27,685
Speaker 7:  this, we've been trying to get your sports rights to offer a sports specific

313
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:31,645
Speaker 7:  package to fans for literally 10 years. And now you guys are gonna

314
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,925
Speaker 7:  team up and do this yourselves and compete against us.

315
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:38,125
Speaker 7:  Absolutely not. That's so within, it was two weeks, within two weeks. So

316
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,485
Speaker 7:  their, their lawyers were quick. The announcement was February 6th of last

317
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:45,325
Speaker 7:  year, the lawsuit February 20th. Wow. And that was basically

318
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:47,285
Speaker 7:  the beginning of the end of Venu Sports.

319
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:51,845
Speaker 1:  What describe Fu Bo's case? Just sort of that at a, at a broad level.

320
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:55,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So I think there's mainly two issues,

321
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:59,365
Speaker 7:  both legally and in the court of public opinion that they raised. The first

322
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:03,885
Speaker 7:  is, is obviously this cartel question of aren't these competitors, they bid

323
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:07,845
Speaker 7:  against each other for rights. They theoretically have to

324
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:11,165
Speaker 7:  keep costs down because cable companies could theoretically only offer one

325
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:13,645
Speaker 7:  or the other. Again, that doesn't really happen. But in theory, these, these

326
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,125
Speaker 7:  companies should be competing against each other. Why are they now teaming

327
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,205
Speaker 7:  up? So that, that's one. And then two is

328
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,845
Speaker 7:  they never let us do this. You know, we wanted to offer a quote unquote

329
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:26,445
Speaker 7:  skinny bundle, which I dunno if we need to define or if we will get to in

330
00:20:26,445 --> 00:20:29,845
Speaker 7:  a minute. Yeah. But this idea of only offering a sports package is something

331
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,525
Speaker 7:  we wanted to do. They always said it's impossible. Now they're allowing themselves

332
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:35,125
Speaker 7:  to do it. They're kinda self-dealing in that regard. They're not allowing

333
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,845
Speaker 7:  us to do it. So those were the two main arguments that, that FUBU made.

334
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:42,525
Speaker 1:  And pretty immediately it seemed that people who were paying attention

335
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:45,845
Speaker 1:  thought this was a very good case that FUBU had. Yeah,

336
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:49,245
Speaker 7:  It's interesting. I honestly, again, maybe this is because I know of the

337
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:52,765
Speaker 7:  Fuo backstory, kind of saw this a little bit of sour grapes at the beginning

338
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,525
Speaker 7:  Hmm. Of like, oh, here's some competitor that's being run over by the bigger

339
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:59,685
Speaker 7:  companies who's hoping court will save them. I, we've seen that story a million

340
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:01,805
Speaker 7:  times. It usually doesn't, it usually doesn't turn out well for the little

341
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:04,845
Speaker 7:  guy. True. And so maybe, you know, this is, this is a good underdog story

342
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:08,245
Speaker 7:  in sports in some ways. But so, So I, I do think initially, again, I don't

343
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:10,565
Speaker 7:  have a legal background. That was kind of my first read on this. Whenever

344
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:13,405
Speaker 7:  I kind of see a lawsuit against a new thing coming out, it's just somebody

345
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,605
Speaker 7:  trying to slow down a competitor. But yeah, I, I think as you mentioned,

346
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:20,125
Speaker 7:  as soon as we started to hear hearings, as soon as there were experts and,

347
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,685
Speaker 7:  and, and legal witnesses kind of weighing in here,

348
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:28,365
Speaker 7:  there did start to be some sense. And I, I think this even was true of

349
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:30,725
Speaker 7:  the venue operators at first, they were like, oh, you know, this is something

350
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:33,765
Speaker 7:  we're gonna overcome. We're still planning to launch six months after the

351
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,485
Speaker 7:  announcement. And then as that launch got closer and closer and the courts,

352
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:40,925
Speaker 7:  you know, denied motion after motion to dismiss, then I think

353
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:44,125
Speaker 7:  eventually, and, and maybe it took even longer than that, they woke up to,

354
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,125
Speaker 7:  okay, maybe this is an, an actual problem.

355
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:50,345
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Do you think what happened essentially is, is

356
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:55,265
Speaker 1:  somebody at venue or at one of these companies basically looked around and

357
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:58,185
Speaker 1:  was like, why aren't we fighting this fight anymore? Like, is this, yes,

358
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:02,185
Speaker 1:  we're going to, we're going to potentially put ourselves through this incredible

359
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:05,665
Speaker 1:  legal ringer just to launch a thing that a lot of people are skeptical is

360
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:09,145
Speaker 1:  going to work at all. And then just like shook hands and walked away. Like,

361
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:10,465
Speaker 1:  do you think that's basically where they landed?

362
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:14,985
Speaker 7:  I think that's basically where they landed. I think ESPN,

363
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:18,305
Speaker 7:  again, the biggest player here when it comes to sports rights is launching

364
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:22,025
Speaker 7:  their own service this year. And so it was always a little confusing that

365
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:25,025
Speaker 7:  they were gonna launch this venue product last year. And then their own direct

366
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:27,625
Speaker 7:  consumer service, right. Again, does not yet have a name. They like to take

367
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,065
Speaker 7:  their time with these things. Evidently they're

368
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:31,145
Speaker 1:  Calling it flagship, which I feel like they're gonna launch it.

369
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,265
Speaker 7:  I wanted, I wanted to mention this. They kind of stole that from you. No,

370
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:35,105
Speaker 7:  it, it is The Verge kind of They did that is gonna

371
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,065
Speaker 1:  Bring a lawsuit and we will be the flagship podcast of sports entertainment.

372
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:40,985
Speaker 1:  Okay. For as long as it is necessary to be, don't worry.

373
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:45,385
Speaker 7:  Good, good. Yeah. They're, they're calling it flagship internally. Can

374
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:47,505
Speaker 7:  I give you my pitch for the name? I don't know. We can get that to that,

375
00:22:47,505 --> 00:22:47,905
Speaker 7:  the end. Oh

376
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:48,505
Speaker 1:  No, I'm ready. Hit

377
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:52,305
Speaker 7:  Me. Okay. You've heard of ESPN two, ESPN three. Yeah.

378
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:56,625
Speaker 7:  I think this should be called ESPN one, so it's all in one. Ooh, no, I don't

379
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,225
Speaker 7:  think it's been used before. You obviously have Apple One. I think there's

380
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:02,185
Speaker 7:  some familiarity with, with the concept of one first. Oh,

381
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:05,845
Speaker 1:  I actually really like that. Do you spell it out or do you do the number

382
00:23:06,095 --> 00:23:07,805
Speaker 7:  Spell it out? I think, I think that's classier.

383
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:11,205
Speaker 1:  I think so too. And you do it in the font. So it's just E-S-P-N-O-N-E-I kind

384
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:11,885
Speaker 1:  of like that. Mm,

385
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:16,565
Speaker 7:  Yep. Some like win one play, you know, for, for the marketing. Yeah. So

386
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:19,925
Speaker 7:  I, I'm putting that down now so that I can sue if if they do go

387
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:21,525
Speaker 1:  With Yeah. Tm, tm, tm. This

388
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:21,685
Speaker 7:  Is

389
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:26,445
Speaker 1:  T Bones this. That's very good. Yeah. Okay. So ESPN has been

390
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:30,365
Speaker 1:  saying forever that it's gonna launch this thing. I wanna get

391
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:34,005
Speaker 1:  in a minute into what that thing is because it's, it is also sort of slightly

392
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:35,165
Speaker 1:  amorphous. Yeah.

393
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:37,245
Speaker 7:  'cause some people are like, oh, wait, doesn't ESPN have a streaming service?

394
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:41,045
Speaker 7:  It's called ESPN Plus, which they do, but they do. But it offers

395
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:44,005
Speaker 7:  a very small slice of what you get otherwise.

396
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,005
Speaker 1:  Right, right. And so, yeah. So let's, let's come back to that in just one

397
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,885
Speaker 1:  second, because I think the, the, what is the landscape for sports fans

398
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:53,725
Speaker 1:  now, I think starts with ESPN. So let's come back to that. Okay. But,

399
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:58,605
Speaker 1:  but yeah. So if you're ESPN and you're, you're Disney, or even

400
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:02,525
Speaker 1:  if you're David Zaslav and, and Warner Discovery, and you're really

401
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:06,085
Speaker 1:  focused on Max and trying to grow that stuff, yeah. It sort of makes sense

402
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:08,845
Speaker 1:  that you would look at this and be like, this is way more hassle than it's

403
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:10,205
Speaker 1:  worth. Let's just, let's just pull the plug.

404
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:12,805
Speaker 7:  Right. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. And so, yeah, max, as you mentioned,

405
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:16,765
Speaker 7:  they launched a sports tier, I believe last fall, which was free for a long

406
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:18,885
Speaker 7:  time. I think it now costs extra. I'm not entirely sure.

407
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:23,485
Speaker 1:  I can't say I've watched a ton of Bleacher Report on Max, if I'm being honest

408
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:23,685
Speaker 1:  with

409
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:27,005
Speaker 7:  You. Okay. I, yeah, I have, I I, I think, I dunno if I'm the only one, but

410
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:31,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And again, this kind of brings us back to Fox, which has the Super

411
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:34,165
Speaker 7:  Bowl in two or three weeks. Right. I think they would've loved to have had

412
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:37,085
Speaker 7:  a streaming service that you signed up for tied to the Super Bowl. They would've

413
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:41,045
Speaker 7:  loved to lock you in for a year to watch Super Bowl. And they're, they're

414
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:45,005
Speaker 7:  kind of back to the one that doesn't have a sports

415
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:48,605
Speaker 7:  streaming service. And, and we'll see what their next move is here. But yeah,

416
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:50,965
Speaker 7:  I think especially when you're looking at Warner and you're looking at Disney,

417
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:55,045
Speaker 7:  they got a lot of other things going on. Let's just, let's just move this

418
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:58,965
Speaker 7:  aside and, and so fubu, we can kind of move

419
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:02,205
Speaker 7:  this in whenever you want, but FUBU signed an agreement with those three

420
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:06,165
Speaker 7:  companies to drop its lawsuit earlier this month. And for, I would say for

421
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:09,565
Speaker 7:  24 to 36 hours, the venue hype was back on. Everyone's like, okay, this is

422
00:25:09,565 --> 00:25:13,325
Speaker 7:  happening. We were hearing on background that venue was gonna launch. It

423
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:16,165
Speaker 7:  was maybe gonna launch from March Madness with the NBA playoffs. And then

424
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:20,085
Speaker 7:  36 hours later, again it went, it went out the way

425
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,885
Speaker 7:  it came in with a press release from the three companies saying actually

426
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:24,805
Speaker 7:  we're good venue is no more.

427
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:28,245
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Well, there's one other thing that happened to Fuo that I think is

428
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:31,325
Speaker 1:  interesting. Yes. Which is that they made this deal with Disney. Can you

429
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:32,005
Speaker 1:  explain what's going on there?

430
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:36,045
Speaker 7:  I can try. Yeah. So as part of this multifaceted

431
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:40,045
Speaker 7:  agreements to, that included dropping the venue lawsuit and included

432
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:44,085
Speaker 7:  a payment of more than $200 million to FUBU as part of the

433
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:47,805
Speaker 7:  legal settlement. It also included a multifaceted

434
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:51,725
Speaker 7:  merger between Disney and FUBU that will see what I'm calling New

435
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,645
Speaker 7:  fubu, but other people are calling Ulu

436
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:59,685
Speaker 7:  is that Fuo will take over control of Hulu

437
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:02,605
Speaker 7:  plus live tv, which is another service we have not discussed at all,

438
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:07,205
Speaker 7:  but has been around for quite some time. And that again, is more of a YouTube

439
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:09,925
Speaker 7:  TV competitor. It's hundred channels for a hundred dollars more or less.

440
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:10,445
Speaker 7:  It's

441
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:13,685
Speaker 1:  Like the second fiddle to YouTube tv. Right, exactly. YouTube TV is kind

442
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:17,245
Speaker 1:  of winning the cable replacement wars and Hulu with live TV is in second

443
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:17,445
Speaker 1:  place.

444
00:26:17,555 --> 00:26:20,885
Speaker 7:  Very importantly, it is the second fiddle. And so last year, I don't know

445
00:26:20,885 --> 00:26:24,725
Speaker 7:  If you felt this way, I felt like YouTube TV had won this race,

446
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:28,445
Speaker 7:  whatever this race was for virtual cable, YouTube TV won it. There was, you

447
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:32,045
Speaker 7:  know, a, a PlayStation view moment. There was a sling moment. I don't know

448
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:34,925
Speaker 7:  if DirecTV Stream ever had a moment, but it has always been there. Yep. But

449
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:38,725
Speaker 7:  by last year, YouTube TV had Sunday ticket. Very importantly, it

450
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:42,765
Speaker 7:  had very good ease of use. And it was YouTube,

451
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:46,485
Speaker 7:  everyone knew it, trusted it, whatever. Yeah. And So I, I think

452
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:50,285
Speaker 7:  Disney saw that and said, that's not good. If the future

453
00:26:50,785 --> 00:26:54,405
Speaker 7:  in five years is there's only one company distributing cable

454
00:26:55,355 --> 00:26:58,765
Speaker 7:  over the internet or at all, and it's Google, suddenly we're negotiating

455
00:26:58,765 --> 00:27:02,445
Speaker 7:  with them and and they could cut us off. We need a better competitor.

456
00:27:03,185 --> 00:27:06,885
Speaker 7:  And we have this Hulu thing here, which they has always kind of been off

457
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:10,285
Speaker 7:  to the side in the Disney streaming universe. Yeah. The live TV product

458
00:27:11,705 --> 00:27:15,485
Speaker 7:  and, and the Hulu plus live tv. There's actually a space between

459
00:27:15,555 --> 00:27:19,005
Speaker 7:  Hulu and plus, unlike ESPN or Disney Plus, which don't have a space, it never

460
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,485
Speaker 7:  made any sense. No. So this is a kind of a chance to fresh start.

461
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:26,725
Speaker 7:  Fubu, why don't you run this? We'll take 70% of this new Fuo company

462
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:31,085
Speaker 7:  and why don't you try to compete with YouTube tv? And importantly, probably

463
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,405
Speaker 7:  most importantly for fubu, we're gonna let you launch that thing you've wanted

464
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:37,205
Speaker 7:  to launch for 10 years, which is a sports skinny bundle, which they are

465
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:40,805
Speaker 7:  at work on now planning to launch as as soon as they can.

466
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:45,005
Speaker 1:  So that strikes me as actually a pretty big deal. And I think, yes,

467
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:49,285
Speaker 1:  all the machinations here got so weird that I think people got

468
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:53,285
Speaker 1:  confused. But I think like FUBU is very powerful at this moment. Mm. Now

469
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,445
Speaker 1:  and I think it, it, it, it kind of has it, there are a lot of

470
00:27:57,445 --> 00:28:01,245
Speaker 1:  ways it could fumble this opportunity, but it does feel like, I mean,

471
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:04,685
Speaker 1:  Hulu with live TV grew very much on the back of sports, right? Like they

472
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,445
Speaker 1:  had that, that whole ad campaign that was just athletes being like, oh, H

473
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:09,485
Speaker 7:  Has live sports over and over again.

474
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:13,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And, and I think, and, and you know, the, the YouTube TV folks say

475
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:17,245
Speaker 1:  that the main reason people come to YouTube TV is for live sports. That's

476
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:19,165
Speaker 1:  why people, that's why they went out and spent all that money for Sunday

477
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:22,565
Speaker 1:  ticket. Like that's still the reason people want these services. And

478
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:26,965
Speaker 1:  for FUBU to now be able to a, be a meaningful competitor cable, which I think

479
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:30,885
Speaker 1:  it it is now, and b be able to

480
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:34,765
Speaker 1:  do if not like full venue then like kind of venue, like

481
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:35,325
Speaker 1:  venue light.

482
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:39,565
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Or even venue plus arguably. 'cause I I, they are going again, we'll

483
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:41,845
Speaker 7:  see what the product looks like. They'll have a chance potentially to bring

484
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,325
Speaker 7:  in your local sports network or some of these other That's true networks

485
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:49,245
Speaker 7:  as well. Your MLB TV or what have you. So they even have a chance. It is,

486
00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:52,805
Speaker 7:  it's exactly like you said. I think suddenly these leagues and and distributors

487
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:56,045
Speaker 7:  are looking at Fuo as, as exactly what they wanted to be looked at, which

488
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:59,245
Speaker 7:  is, which is a tool here to, to help distribute

489
00:28:59,245 --> 00:29:02,965
Speaker 1:  Games. Yeah. We've like added a real sports competitor,

490
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,285
Speaker 1:  just not the one anybody expected or meant to launch. It's, it's a very strange

491
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:11,165
Speaker 1:  outcome that Fuo is, is kind of the

492
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:14,485
Speaker 1:  only survivor in this, in this fight. It's,

493
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:17,485
Speaker 7:  It's, it's, it's really, it's something, these are huge companies we're talking

494
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:20,845
Speaker 7:  about huge tech companies, huge entertainment companies. And this is, you

495
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:24,445
Speaker 7:  know, a a startup that launched basically with like international soccer

496
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:27,405
Speaker 7:  rights 10 years ago. And now here they are. And maybe they're how we're gonna

497
00:29:27,405 --> 00:29:30,925
Speaker 7:  be watching sports in a couple years. It's, it's truly, truly crazy. I, I

498
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:34,705
Speaker 7:  will, the one other thing working in this favor is I do think the

499
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:37,985
Speaker 7:  YouTube TV price hike in December,

500
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:41,320
Speaker 7:  they announced they were gonna raise prices by 15%. Yeah. Which is, is I

501
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,405
Speaker 7:  think was, you know, $10, one of their biggest jumps yet. I think that was

502
00:29:44,405 --> 00:29:47,925
Speaker 7:  a big wake up moment for a lot of people say, oh, maybe we should try to

503
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:51,405
Speaker 7:  see if there's anything else that we can use as an alternative here, because

504
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:52,845
Speaker 7:  otherwise this could, this could run away from us.

505
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:55,805
Speaker 1:  I mean, you, it, it just is cable now, right, right. Like it's, it's not

506
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:59,765
Speaker 1:  even cable, but cheaper. It's just cable, but easier to cancel.

507
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:03,005
Speaker 1:  And that's not nothing. Right. Like, it, it is meaningful that it is, is

508
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:04,645
Speaker 1:  easier to get in and out of those things.

509
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:08,765
Speaker 7:  Easier to cancel, easier to watch anywhere you want unlimited dvr. There

510
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,605
Speaker 7:  are, there are nice things about it. I I, I think you, you mentioned this

511
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:15,045
Speaker 7:  earlier too. One of the things I push back against this idea that like

512
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:19,205
Speaker 7:  sports is watching sports is worse than it ever was, is it is so much more

513
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:22,885
Speaker 7:  available than it ever was. And I think we take that for granted that 10

514
00:30:22,885 --> 00:30:26,605
Speaker 7:  years ago, a lot of these things you couldn't watch or you could watch very

515
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:29,725
Speaker 7:  expensively or you had to put a satellite on your house. These things have

516
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:32,085
Speaker 7:  gotten a lot easier, but they've also gotten a lot more expensive. So, so

517
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:33,165
Speaker 7:  that's, that's where it sits. It

518
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:36,365
Speaker 1:  Definitely, it cuts both directions that it is. Yeah. There is, there is

519
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:40,485
Speaker 1:  more stuff you can watch than ever for sure. But

520
00:30:40,815 --> 00:30:44,125
Speaker 1:  those things are in more places than ever. Right, right. And So I guess like

521
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:48,005
Speaker 1:  as a sports fan on balance, I'll take that trade like, yeah, sure,

522
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:52,085
Speaker 1:  I'll pay, I'll pay all your stupid prices just to watch your games. But

523
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:53,525
Speaker 1:  because now I can and that's something,

524
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:56,765
Speaker 7:  But the league's problem is a lot of people who aren't yet sports fans are

525
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:59,965
Speaker 7:  saying, I'm signing up for what, I'm signing up for 40 years of being jerked

526
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:03,525
Speaker 7:  around between 12 different services and no, I'm just gonna, you know, stay

527
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:04,685
Speaker 7:  on TikTok, isn catch the highlights.

528
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:08,045
Speaker 1:  Right. Yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna watch ESPN's social accounts, not

529
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:11,965
Speaker 1:  ESPN's cable channels. Speaking of, let's, let's talk about what's coming

530
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:15,765
Speaker 1:  this year, because I think other than that

531
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:19,765
Speaker 1:  whole saga of last year, I think one of the big stories for me

532
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:23,565
Speaker 1:  of 2024 was that it is now abundantly clear

533
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:27,405
Speaker 1:  that all of the tech companies are all in on sports. Yes. Apple is in

534
00:31:27,665 --> 00:31:31,645
Speaker 1:  Amazon is in Google is in Netflix is in, like, these companies are spending

535
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:36,245
Speaker 1:  real money on sports things that matter, that people care about. And Netflix

536
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:40,165
Speaker 1:  keeps like sandbagging itself, but it's, it's lying. Netflix cares

537
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,205
Speaker 1:  deeply about this stuff.

538
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:46,685
Speaker 1:  Then you have this sort of lingering possibility of whatever

539
00:31:46,845 --> 00:31:50,645
Speaker 1:  ESPN is about to launch. Yeah. What do you think

540
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:54,645
Speaker 1:  is coming this year? What's, what's 2025 gonna look like? Is, are

541
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:58,005
Speaker 1:  we just waiting around to see what this ESPN thing is? Is that kind of the

542
00:31:58,005 --> 00:31:58,845
Speaker 1:  big unknown at the moment?

543
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:03,765
Speaker 7:  So I, I think, like I said, if 2024 was this year of, we're all on YouTube

544
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:06,525
Speaker 7:  tv and we're all on these services, I think 2025 is the year of

545
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:11,325
Speaker 7:  sports streaming. Getting pretty weird in a few different ways. I think

546
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:14,805
Speaker 7:  we're talking about these skinny bundles. We just saw DirecTV launched a

547
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:17,485
Speaker 7:  new product called My Sports last week. Oh yeah, that's right. Which again,

548
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:21,005
Speaker 7:  is this kind of skinny bundle concept where you're getting 20 to 25 channels.

549
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:24,765
Speaker 7:  FUBU ISS gonna launch theirs, would not be shocked to see YouTube tv try

550
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:27,965
Speaker 7:  to do something like that whenever they get the, the ability to in their

551
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:30,525
Speaker 7:  agreements. So we're gonna see a lot of these services and then we're gonna

552
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:34,405
Speaker 7:  see these companies, Warner, ESPN, launching their own things. And then we're

553
00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:37,205
Speaker 7:  gonna see Amazon, like you're saying, Amazon and Google continue to build

554
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:41,005
Speaker 7:  products for sports. Apple continue to build products for sports

555
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:45,125
Speaker 7:  and, and, and so it's gonna be messy. It's, it's not, it's not gonna be clean

556
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:48,245
Speaker 7:  by the end of the year. It's gonna be messy. But I I I think as you said,

557
00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:50,845
Speaker 7:  ESPN is gonna be at the center of, of what that looks like. What

558
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:54,685
Speaker 1:  Do we know about ESPN's coming service? What,

559
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,725
Speaker 1:  what is the size of that thing gonna be? So

560
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,045
Speaker 7:  Yeah, ESPN flagship,

561
00:32:58,675 --> 00:32:59,645
Speaker 1:  ESPN one, tm,

562
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:02,845
Speaker 7:  Espn one tm almost certainly launching before football season,

563
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:07,405
Speaker 7:  probably with a different name. Again, we can start with the price. They

564
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:11,245
Speaker 7:  haven't announced it yet. PE my bet if we're, if we're putting betting, putting

565
00:33:11,245 --> 00:33:15,085
Speaker 7:  money down, and this is sports, so why not, is this probably, they

566
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,725
Speaker 7:  probably find a way to start this at $20 a month. Whether that's, that's

567
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:21,205
Speaker 7:  my guess too. That's discount rate or, you know, lock you in or

568
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:25,245
Speaker 7:  whatever, longer term. They're not gonna want you to know how much you're

569
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:28,685
Speaker 7:  paying for this. They're gonna want it bundled in with your phone bill or

570
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:32,485
Speaker 7:  your Disney bundle or your life insurance or you know,

571
00:33:32,605 --> 00:33:34,565
Speaker 7:  whatever, whatever it takes to get you paying for this.

572
00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:37,925
Speaker 1:  I mean, and remember when Disney launched Disney Plus, they had all of these

573
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:41,845
Speaker 1:  wild yes promotions that If you signed up for a year at the very beginning,

574
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:45,085
Speaker 1:  it was much cheaper. And then it just sort of slowly, steadily got more expensive,

575
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:47,245
Speaker 1:  but then they started to bundle stuff in. So I Yeah, I think you're right.

576
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:48,285
Speaker 1:  It's gonna go exactly the same way.

577
00:33:48,305 --> 00:33:50,045
Speaker 7:  And, and that playbook worked out well for them. They're gonna bring that

578
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:53,765
Speaker 7:  back. So that is what it's gonna cost. That's what it may or may not be named.

579
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,405
Speaker 7:  So what is it gonna provide? So it's going to provide everything

580
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:01,765
Speaker 7:  that ESP n sees, the, the ESPN empire from, from coast to coast.

581
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:06,805
Speaker 7:  Its live rights, its studio programming. The company

582
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:10,805
Speaker 7:  is very committed to launching or relaunching its app tied to this

583
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:14,845
Speaker 7:  so that your fantasy is gonna be in there, your betting is gonna be in there,

584
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:18,485
Speaker 7:  your shopping is gonna be evident. This is gonna be in, in their mind the,

585
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:21,725
Speaker 7:  the everything sports app. They want to,

586
00:34:22,265 --> 00:34:25,285
Speaker 7:  you know, they, they launched this where to watch feature last year, which

587
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:28,805
Speaker 7:  shows where games are on outside of their networks, which is kind of new

588
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:31,805
Speaker 7:  and different. They want you to be the place you go for sports,

589
00:34:32,985 --> 00:34:35,005
Speaker 7:  you know, forevermore. It's

590
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:38,205
Speaker 1:  The where to watch thing that I think strikes me as the most interesting

591
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:41,365
Speaker 1:  because I think you're right that the, you can sort of see the pieces, like

592
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:45,205
Speaker 1:  ES ESPN BET continues to grow and it, it's fantasy stuff continues to grow

593
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:48,685
Speaker 1:  and the idea of putting all those things together and

594
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:52,565
Speaker 1:  sort of making them speak to each other better makes sense. Right? Like that

595
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:55,885
Speaker 1:  seems fairly clearly where it's gonna go. But ESP n also seems to have this

596
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:59,645
Speaker 1:  idea of being like the TV guide to all sports, even the ones that

597
00:34:59,645 --> 00:35:03,525
Speaker 1:  aren't on ESPN's platforms. Yes. Super

598
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:07,525
Speaker 1:  interesting and good and powerful idea if ESPN can pull it off. I actually

599
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:11,205
Speaker 1:  think the, the where to watch page is fabulous. It is like, it is such a

600
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:14,805
Speaker 1:  good useful thing that should have existed very a long time ago. That's just

601
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:18,605
Speaker 1:  like, what network is this game on? Right? But like, I can't imagine

602
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:22,085
Speaker 1:  everybody being psyched about me wanting to watch

603
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:26,845
Speaker 1:  an MLS game on Apple TV and first going to the

604
00:35:26,965 --> 00:35:30,805
Speaker 1:  ESPN app in order to do that. And we've seen this before, even with

605
00:35:30,805 --> 00:35:34,725
Speaker 1:  like the, the TV guide, like services like Netflix doesn't wanna play along

606
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:36,765
Speaker 1:  with those services. Exactly. So it doesn't really give them data. Lots of

607
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:40,725
Speaker 1:  these things don't, like does ESPN even have a real chance of pulling

608
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:42,045
Speaker 1:  this off in a meaningful way?

609
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:47,885
Speaker 7:  That's a good question. And I will say ESPN's not the only one that wants

610
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:50,485
Speaker 7:  to do this. As you mentioned. You know, I think Amazon sees itself as the

611
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:53,725
Speaker 7:  hub for sports. YouTube sees itself as the hub for sports. FUBU sees itself

612
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:57,205
Speaker 7:  as the hub for sports on down the line for me,

613
00:35:57,475 --> 00:36:01,085
Speaker 7:  when I am trying to figure out what's on or what channel it's on, like I

614
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:04,445
Speaker 7:  go to Google and I think Google knows that. And I think Google's thinking

615
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:08,285
Speaker 7:  about that opportunity too. You know, if they can link you out to

616
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:11,405
Speaker 7:  these services and, and collect a fee when you sign up, et cetera.

617
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:16,085
Speaker 7:  So I, it's, it's gonna be challenging a, again, as much as we might,

618
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:20,085
Speaker 7:  we might all want this, this kind of one place, this hub, whatever. I,

619
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:23,525
Speaker 7:  it's, it's a very, very far away away. I think we're probably 10 years away

620
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:26,685
Speaker 7:  from Amazon and Netflix and Google all giving it a go, seeing where things

621
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:30,605
Speaker 7:  shake out and then, and then consolidating back, back into one one place.

622
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,405
Speaker 7:  So, but in the meantime, yeah, I I think there's an information

623
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:37,325
Speaker 7:  aspect of it that they can provide. They can tell you it's on Netflix. Netflix

624
00:36:37,335 --> 00:36:40,245
Speaker 7:  can't stop them from telling you that. And then it's just a question of Yeah,

625
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:43,125
Speaker 7:  how, how willing ESPN is to, to send you to other places.

626
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:47,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I think it, it makes sense to me that ES ESPN would be willing

627
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:49,565
Speaker 1:  to send you to other places actually, just because that stuff is so

628
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:54,405
Speaker 1:  immutable, right? Like ES ESPN is just not going to get the NBA rights it

629
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:58,045
Speaker 1:  doesn't have for a long time. And so if you're ES espn, you can either

630
00:36:58,365 --> 00:37:01,325
Speaker 1:  bury your head in the sand until a decade from now and then try to win the

631
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:04,765
Speaker 1:  rights. Or you can say, okay, we're gonna get people here to bet and then

632
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,925
Speaker 1:  we can have them go watch somewhere else. And as long as we are the place

633
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:11,805
Speaker 1:  they come first we win. But also, you know, who wants to be the place people

634
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:15,085
Speaker 1:  go first is literally everybody else. Right? Right. And so, and this has

635
00:37:15,085 --> 00:37:18,925
Speaker 1:  been the thing with streaming in general forever and is like, again,

636
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,925
Speaker 1:  I I come back to like what users want is so clear. And I think the

637
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:26,485
Speaker 1:  ESPN's where to watch page really worked for me because it is, it is that

638
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:29,165
Speaker 1:  thing I should go and it's like, here are all the games on and here's how

639
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:32,765
Speaker 1:  to watch them. That is, that is a thing that ought to exist. And it's

640
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:36,005
Speaker 1:  ESPN does like a medium job of it, but it's, it's great that it exists at

641
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:36,085
Speaker 1:  all.

642
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,525
Speaker 7:  That's what I was gonna say. Yeah. All these things, again, going somewhat

643
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:42,445
Speaker 7:  like venue, they have half the things you want. Right. At a cost slightly

644
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:44,525
Speaker 7:  higher. Apple sports, I think is another example of this, right? They launched

645
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:48,325
Speaker 7:  an app for the first time last year. It's a big step in this direction. It

646
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:51,445
Speaker 7:  still doesn't have golf and tennis and NASCAR and F1 Right.

647
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:56,085
Speaker 7:  Olympics are on down the line, you know? Yeah. I think even, I think when

648
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:59,485
Speaker 7:  I talked to PN in August, September, I think they had like 300 leagues in

649
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,205
Speaker 7:  where to watch. And they were still getting requests daily from fans and

650
00:38:02,205 --> 00:38:05,405
Speaker 7:  also from leagues be like, Hey, why don't you list our right

651
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:08,405
Speaker 7:  Mid-American conference volleyball games in here. People wanna watch these,

652
00:38:08,465 --> 00:38:11,205
Speaker 7:  you know, why don't you list our minor league baseball on down the line?

653
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:15,085
Speaker 7:  So it's the, the simplicity and the, the, the

654
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,965
Speaker 7:  exhaust of this hubs is, is always gonna be just that reach.

655
00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:21,365
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So where do you think that leaves us as sports watchers

656
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:25,085
Speaker 1:  for the next couple of years? I mean, I think on the one hand, like you said,

657
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:28,805
Speaker 1:  there is more to watch than ever. And in many ways the user experience of

658
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:32,685
Speaker 1:  watching those things is better than ever. Like, we're kind of past Amazon

659
00:38:32,785 --> 00:38:36,565
Speaker 1:  not being very good at streaming football games where like it's

660
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,645
Speaker 1:  most football games you wanna watch on the internet are available and they're

661
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:42,685
Speaker 1:  there. They might be expensive, but they're pretty good. Is that as good

662
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:45,645
Speaker 1:  as it's gonna be for a while? Like, is the, is the rest of the landscape

663
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:48,645
Speaker 1:  gonna get really just messier before it gets cleaner here?

664
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:52,945
Speaker 7:  That's as good as it's gonna be. And, and like you said, I think buffering

665
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:56,105
Speaker 7:  and, and delays was a big problem. You know, we saw, obviously with Netflix's

666
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:58,825
Speaker 7:  first time out every time, every time a streaming services launch, you know,

667
00:38:58,825 --> 00:39:01,865
Speaker 7:  their first live sporting event, it usually goes pretty poorly. Police reports

668
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:05,785
Speaker 7:  crash when they try to launch a golf event five years ago, Netflix

669
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:10,305
Speaker 7:  almost crashed entirely when they try to put Jake Paul on.

670
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:14,265
Speaker 7:  So I, I think now we've seen almost, I think maybe all

671
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:18,065
Speaker 7:  of the players have those moments. It's reliable, right? Yeah. You, you,

672
00:39:18,085 --> 00:39:20,545
Speaker 7:  you search, you do have to search where the game is on Google, but once you

673
00:39:20,545 --> 00:39:23,505
Speaker 7:  find it, once you go there, once you pay, you can watch usually,

674
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:28,465
Speaker 7:  you know, we can get into regional blackouts and all that, but that's, that

675
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:32,385
Speaker 7:  is working. I I think where all these companies wanna

676
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:36,145
Speaker 7:  make these games more interactive where you're talking to your friends in

677
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:40,065
Speaker 7:  inside the stream. I think for the most part that's more trouble than

678
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:42,985
Speaker 7:  it's worth. Yeah. But, but yeah, the, the idea of putting the game on If

679
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:46,145
Speaker 7:  you want to finally, I think for a lot of people is, is a reality. If, If

680
00:39:46,145 --> 00:39:48,945
Speaker 7:  you're willing to pay the cost and, and maybe, maybe we should, you know,

681
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:52,705
Speaker 7:  take a moment to celebrate that before we complain about everything else.

682
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:57,025
Speaker 1:  Agreed. It costs a million dollars, but I can watch every NFL game that exists

683
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,585
Speaker 1:  and that that is something. So

684
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:00,345
Speaker 7:  Yeah, shut up and, and grab the popcorn. Yeah,

685
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:01,745
Speaker 1:  Exactly. Exactly.

686
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:06,945
Speaker 1:  Who do you think is the sort of player to watch this year? I mean, I think

687
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:10,905
Speaker 1:  to me ESPN is, is both like the biggest name in this space and

688
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:14,145
Speaker 1:  also the one that might have the sort of single

689
00:40:14,275 --> 00:40:17,865
Speaker 1:  splashiest plan for this year. But like, I don't know, suddenly

690
00:40:18,145 --> 00:40:20,625
Speaker 1:  FUBU strikes me as a really interesting company to pay attention to as a

691
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:24,065
Speaker 1:  sports fan. Like I have, I have never once in my life watched FUBU and I

692
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:28,025
Speaker 1:  that will, I'm I suspect change this year. Yeah. Is do you

693
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,865
Speaker 1:  have any other bets on like who you're really paying close attention to?

694
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:34,345
Speaker 7:  I think this is gonna be the year that Amazon really establishes itself in

695
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:36,825
Speaker 7:  sports. They're, they're getting the NBA primarily. That's the biggest thing.

696
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:39,785
Speaker 7:  That's right. So starting next NBA season in the fall, it'll be on Amazon.

697
00:40:39,785 --> 00:40:43,585
Speaker 7:  They're gonna take over this in-season tournament to the NBA cup as kind

698
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:47,385
Speaker 7:  of their, their, their crowning rights there. Thursday night

699
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:49,785
Speaker 7:  football continues to grow. They had a playoff game just this, just this

700
00:40:49,785 --> 00:40:52,185
Speaker 7:  year. So I'm counting that as, as part of the, the year of Amazon sports,

701
00:40:52,355 --> 00:40:55,705
Speaker 7:  going back to the hub conversation, they've been involved in the regional

702
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:58,745
Speaker 7:  sports network side of things. You can now subscribe to the regional sports

703
00:40:58,745 --> 00:41:02,105
Speaker 7:  network service for certain number of markets. And it's certain, you know,

704
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:05,905
Speaker 7:  blah, blah blah within Amazon. I, I think, I wouldn't be

705
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:09,865
Speaker 7:  surprised to see, you know, them launch some sort of, whether

706
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:13,985
Speaker 7:  FUBU was in Amazon or, or ESPN service, a discount for Prime,

707
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:17,705
Speaker 7:  you know, whatever. I think they have the unique position where they can

708
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:20,505
Speaker 7:  monetize this. And, and from the prime membership perspective and from the

709
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:24,105
Speaker 7:  advertising perspective, which is what, you know, you've heard people who

710
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:26,305
Speaker 7:  who follow Amazon have heard this a million times, but I think that model

711
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:30,745
Speaker 7:  is going to be the way forward a a as sports look for places where they

712
00:41:30,745 --> 00:41:34,525
Speaker 7:  can reach everybody and make money, which

713
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:38,605
Speaker 7:  for a long time has been a bit of a, a balancing act for, for, for

714
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:42,245
Speaker 7:  sports leagues is we can be on TV or with our traditional

715
00:41:42,245 --> 00:41:45,725
Speaker 7:  partners, Fox and CBS, but we're gonna get more money if we go to a

716
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:49,365
Speaker 7:  D zone or, or, or one of these other subscription services that, or even

717
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:53,085
Speaker 7:  an Apple who, who are gonna put us behind a paywall. And, and So I think

718
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:56,565
Speaker 7:  Amazon maybe is gonna find that that middle lane here where

719
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:59,845
Speaker 7:  everybody's happy, including the folks who are spending a lot of money.

720
00:42:00,195 --> 00:42:01,125
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That would be,

721
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:05,565
Speaker 1:  that would put Amazon in a really fascinating position. 'cause I think the

722
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:09,485
Speaker 1:  one thing I've been learning recently is how far ahead Amazon

723
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:13,525
Speaker 1:  is as an ad business from most of the other streamers, which I think I

724
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:17,325
Speaker 1:  underrated for a long time. That like what you're saying is Amazon

725
00:42:17,385 --> 00:42:20,965
Speaker 1:  can afford to pay all of this money for sports,

726
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:25,125
Speaker 1:  not just because it's a giant company that can just, that just throws off

727
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,085
Speaker 1:  cash from other things. Right? Like AWS pays for it. That's fine. Exactly.

728
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:31,965
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But also they can actually directly monetize this in a way that

729
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:35,485
Speaker 1:  most of these other streamers can't. And so they're in a position of like,

730
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:39,765
Speaker 1:  this is not just a bet on other parts of our business that maybe you'll

731
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:42,805
Speaker 1:  come for the Olympics and subscribe to Peacock, which is like a very real

732
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:46,645
Speaker 1:  thing that Comcast did. They're like, we, we can come

733
00:42:46,645 --> 00:42:50,525
Speaker 1:  and maybe you'll subscribe to Prime, but also we can make real money off

734
00:42:50,525 --> 00:42:53,805
Speaker 1:  of this. And that becomes, I think, pretty hard to compete with if Amazon

735
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:54,525
Speaker 1:  can really pull it off.

736
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:57,605
Speaker 7:  And so that's Amazon and that's games. And I think everything outside of

737
00:42:57,605 --> 00:43:01,485
Speaker 7:  games, I'm looking at YouTube, especially once we figure out whatever this

738
00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:04,125
Speaker 7:  TikTok situation is, I think all of these companies that are looking to reach

739
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,965
Speaker 7:  young fans are putting more on YouTube. You know, a not

740
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:11,885
Speaker 7:  that long ago, these leagues were mad at YouTube for putting up

741
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:14,845
Speaker 7:  highlights, and now they're desperate to get their highlights on YouTube

742
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:18,885
Speaker 7:  to be promoted to get the YouTube creators at their games. And So I think

743
00:43:18,885 --> 00:43:21,205
Speaker 7:  YouTube also has a really interesting offering. And obviously Google knows

744
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:24,725
Speaker 7:  how to sell ads too. I think they have a really interesting offering to,

745
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:25,445
Speaker 7:  to leagues as well.

746
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:29,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah, fair enough. I think the, the, the shift towards everybody just

747
00:43:29,655 --> 00:43:32,965
Speaker 1:  being happy about highlights is one that we are like only beginning to figure

748
00:43:33,025 --> 00:43:36,565
Speaker 1:  out, like, I watched a surprising amount number of soccer games in those

749
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:39,805
Speaker 1:  10 minute extended highlights. Yeah, sure. And I don't, I don't know what

750
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:42,805
Speaker 1:  to do about that as a sports fan, but it, it feels, it feels like a change.

751
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:43,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

752
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:47,245
Speaker 1:  Alright, Jacob, thank you for coming on. I appreciate it. You're gonna come

753
00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:50,165
Speaker 1:  back when ESPN one launches and you're gonna gloat about how you were right

754
00:43:50,165 --> 00:43:51,245
Speaker 1:  about the name. It's gonna be amazing.

755
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,685
Speaker 7:  My victory lap. I'm looking forward to it. All

756
00:43:53,685 --> 00:43:54,285
Speaker 1:  Right, thanks man. Thank

757
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:54,965
Speaker 7:  You so much for having me.

758
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,325
Speaker 1:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna

759
00:43:58,325 --> 00:44:02,085
Speaker 1:  talk about books because here on a podcast, it's time to talk about books.

760
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:03,805
Speaker 1:  We'll be right back.

761
00:45:13,955 --> 00:45:16,125
Speaker 3:  Grammarly Enterprise Ready AI

762
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:02,045
Speaker 1:  Alright, we're back. So like I mentioned at the top, we're gonna spend some

763
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:05,885
Speaker 1:  time this week and next week talking about tech ways to do

764
00:47:05,905 --> 00:47:09,205
Speaker 1:  New Year's resolutions. And I think If you look across the world,

765
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:13,605
Speaker 1:  two of the biggest New Year's resolutions are some version of I want to get

766
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:16,645
Speaker 1:  in better shape. You. You can take that kind of as broadly as you'd like

767
00:47:16,645 --> 00:47:20,445
Speaker 1:  to. And I want read more and I think I hear particularly

768
00:47:20,555 --> 00:47:24,325
Speaker 1:  from people is I wanna take the time that I spend on my devices

769
00:47:24,905 --> 00:47:28,765
Speaker 1:  and point it at better things. I want to not instinctively

770
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:32,485
Speaker 1:  open Instagram or TikTok, which who knows where

771
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:36,325
Speaker 1:  that'll go in a few weeks or Reddit or whatever else. And I

772
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:40,125
Speaker 1:  want to do something fulfilling. And I think reading a book

773
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:43,405
Speaker 1:  is, is just kind of the perfect version of that. But there are actually lots

774
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:47,365
Speaker 1:  of things to do that are better than those things even on your phone.

775
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:51,845
Speaker 1:  Kevin Wynn, who is our deputy editor, has been thinking about this

776
00:47:51,845 --> 00:47:55,125
Speaker 1:  stuff for a long time. He actually wrote a story at GQ a bunch of years ago

777
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:59,325
Speaker 1:  about how to read more with a lot of tips that I have really enjoyed

778
00:47:59,345 --> 00:48:02,125
Speaker 1:  and used over the years. So I figured I'd have Kevin on to talk about how

779
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:05,965
Speaker 1:  he gets so much reading done, how we can all get more reading done and

780
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:09,765
Speaker 1:  how we should think about reading books in an increasingly digital

781
00:48:09,945 --> 00:48:13,365
Speaker 1:  and screen-based world. So let's see what we can do here.

782
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,085
Speaker 1:  Kevin Wynn, welcome to the show.

783
00:48:15,455 --> 00:48:16,125
Speaker 10:  How's it going, David,

784
00:48:16,535 --> 00:48:19,725
Speaker 1:  Where are you in the world right now? I have not seen your face in person

785
00:48:19,825 --> 00:48:23,045
Speaker 1:  in a long time. Where, what's, tell us about your setup right now.

786
00:48:23,895 --> 00:48:27,505
Speaker 10:  Yeah, well it's, it's 8:30 AM where you are. It's

787
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,745
Speaker 10:  8:30 PM where I am, which is Ho Chi Minh City,

788
00:48:31,015 --> 00:48:34,865
Speaker 10:  Vietnam, better known as Saigon. And I'm talking

789
00:48:34,885 --> 00:48:38,585
Speaker 10:  to you through my very crummy wifi connection at the

790
00:48:38,725 --> 00:48:39,145
Speaker 10:  Airbnb.

791
00:48:39,775 --> 00:48:43,665
Speaker 1:  Amazing. And you've been there for like, what, almost two months at this

792
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:45,585
Speaker 1:  point? You're like, this is a real, this is a real trip you're doing.

793
00:48:46,055 --> 00:48:47,385
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Who Let me get away with this.

794
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:49,585
Speaker 1:  Unclear, honestly. Yeah,

795
00:48:50,165 --> 00:48:53,465
Speaker 10:  My partner and I have been here for a couple months. I was doing some reporting

796
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,865
Speaker 10:  in Tokyo, which was fine. And actually ended up

797
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,905
Speaker 10:  accidentally helping out with some reporting in Seoul. 'cause that's when

798
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:05,785
Speaker 10:  we landed there. Sarah Jung happened to be there. So we were hanging out

799
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:08,945
Speaker 10:  and then it happened to be martial law. So

800
00:49:10,745 --> 00:49:13,865
Speaker 10:  that was supposed to be my vacation week. And I ended up editing Sarah.

801
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:17,985
Speaker 10:  Although those pieces turned out to be a lot of fun if, If you guys haven't

802
00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:22,105
Speaker 10:  listened to it. Birch Gas listeners, Sarah Jung went to the martial law

803
00:49:22,145 --> 00:49:25,185
Speaker 10:  protests kind of drunk 'cause we were drinking Mako Lee before she showed

804
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:25,345
Speaker 10:  up

805
00:49:25,455 --> 00:49:27,345
Speaker 1:  Kind of drunk. Seems, seems kind.

806
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:28,665
Speaker 10:  That's

807
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:29,345
Speaker 1:  True. Well

808
00:49:29,345 --> 00:49:32,865
Speaker 10:  It was so cold out there and she just like apparently sobered up while she

809
00:49:32,865 --> 00:49:35,865
Speaker 10:  was there. So that's real dedication. That's real reporting

810
00:49:36,665 --> 00:49:40,545
Speaker 1:  A hundred percent truly one of the weirder like 48 hour

811
00:49:40,635 --> 00:49:44,625
Speaker 1:  spans in VERGE history. But it was, it was good stuff. Yes. All

812
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:47,785
Speaker 1:  right, So I brought you here to talk about reading because you are the person

813
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:51,385
Speaker 1:  I know who reads the most and

814
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,585
Speaker 1:  I would say is the most, somewhere between adamant

815
00:49:55,725 --> 00:49:59,585
Speaker 1:  and snobby about how good books are and that people should read

816
00:49:59,585 --> 00:50:02,985
Speaker 1:  more books. And it's, it's January, lots of people wanna read more books

817
00:50:03,845 --> 00:50:07,625
Speaker 1:  and you, in addition to being adamant and snobby about reading books, I think

818
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:11,545
Speaker 1:  have like a good strategy for how to be a normal person in the year

819
00:50:11,545 --> 00:50:15,465
Speaker 1:  2025 and actually read books. So I just wanna talk through that a little

820
00:50:15,465 --> 00:50:17,265
Speaker 1:  bit and see if we can help some people. Does that sound good?

821
00:50:18,025 --> 00:50:21,835
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I'm totally with you. It's funny, like January being like the, The

822
00:50:21,835 --> 00:50:25,515
Speaker 10:  new year new me thing, everyone kind of like wants to read more,

823
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:28,645
Speaker 10:  everyone wants to get back to the gym. Gym. I think there are kind of like

824
00:50:28,955 --> 00:50:32,605
Speaker 10:  some exercise discipline things that can help you read more. But actually

825
00:50:33,105 --> 00:50:36,605
Speaker 10:  in the grand scheme of things, things I sort of reject the idea that reading

826
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:37,565
Speaker 10:  is like exercise.

827
00:50:38,145 --> 00:50:39,285
Speaker 1:  Ooh, interesting. Tell me more.

828
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:43,405
Speaker 10:  I think people, I mean everyone wishes they read more,

829
00:50:44,985 --> 00:50:48,565
Speaker 10:  but I think a lot of it is, it comes from like a self-improvement idea

830
00:50:48,825 --> 00:50:51,605
Speaker 10:  and you know, I think there's a little bit of just like, oh, I wish I spent

831
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:55,285
Speaker 10:  less time on my phone and more time with my nose in a book. That makes sense.

832
00:50:56,155 --> 00:50:59,445
Speaker 10:  It's probably just better for, for your eyes for one for sure.

833
00:51:00,305 --> 00:51:04,045
Speaker 10:  But I think just this thing too that just like, oh, like reading is exercise

834
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:08,125
Speaker 10:  for your brain and, and I think there's like some truth to that, but I

835
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:12,005
Speaker 10:  think If you only think of it as that, as kind of a

836
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:15,985
Speaker 10:  self-improvement medium, I don't know, I think you, you

837
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:18,425
Speaker 10:  kind of miss out on the richness of reading and also the enjoyment of reading.

838
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:18,865
Speaker 10:  Hmm.

839
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:23,425
Speaker 1:  I agree with that. Yeah. The idea that it is sort of a punishment to be endured

840
00:51:23,425 --> 00:51:26,425
Speaker 1:  because there is something good on the other side is also, and it's the same

841
00:51:26,425 --> 00:51:29,825
Speaker 1:  thing people say about exercise, right? That like the, the actual way to

842
00:51:29,825 --> 00:51:33,505
Speaker 1:  succeed at this is to learn to enjoy the thing itself. And, and that actually

843
00:51:33,505 --> 00:51:37,385
Speaker 1:  the thing itself is enjoyable If you do it right and that If you just do

844
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:40,465
Speaker 1:  an exercise that you like and you're gonna exercise a lot more, and actually

845
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:44,145
Speaker 1:  that's better than just beating yourself up on,

846
00:51:44,155 --> 00:51:47,145
Speaker 1:  based on somebody's idea of a good workout because you think you'll feel

847
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:47,785
Speaker 1:  good at the end of it.

848
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:52,355
Speaker 10:  Yeah, a hundred percent. And I, I do think like the, like emotionally,

849
00:51:52,555 --> 00:51:56,315
Speaker 10:  I think the thing that exercise and reading have in common is like, I think

850
00:51:56,415 --> 00:52:00,075
Speaker 10:  it, it's actually kind of hard to like make yourself sit down and open a

851
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:03,355
Speaker 10:  book sometimes, especially after a long day. Especially like when,

852
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:07,595
Speaker 10:  you know, streaming services and video games are kind of like easier

853
00:52:07,735 --> 00:52:11,675
Speaker 10:  to just turn on and, and put your brain into. But sort of

854
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:14,515
Speaker 10:  like exercise, it's like once you get to the gym, you know, like the feeling

855
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:19,155
Speaker 10:  changes very quickly and I think everyone knows that and

856
00:52:19,155 --> 00:52:22,555
Speaker 10:  like, you don't have to wait to get like a runner's hide. It's like once

857
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:23,715
Speaker 10:  you're in it, you're in it, you know?

858
00:52:24,185 --> 00:52:27,755
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. I I, I totally agree with that. So I think there, there are sort

859
00:52:27,755 --> 00:52:30,715
Speaker 1:  of two kinds of reading and you just alluded to both of them. I think on

860
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:34,515
Speaker 1:  the one hand there is the, like I am going to sit down and read

861
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:38,435
Speaker 1:  as like a long activity, right? Like, I'm going to curl up in a chair and

862
00:52:38,435 --> 00:52:40,635
Speaker 1:  pull a blanket over me and, and read for hours.

863
00:52:42,345 --> 00:52:45,965
Speaker 1:  And then there's the, like I read three pages

864
00:52:46,175 --> 00:52:49,725
Speaker 1:  while I'm sitting on the toilet, right? Or like waiting in line for at a

865
00:52:49,725 --> 00:52:52,325
Speaker 1:  coffee shop or whatever. And I wanna, I wanna kind of differentiate both

866
00:52:52,325 --> 00:52:55,245
Speaker 1:  of those because I think you, you have interesting ideas about both of those

867
00:52:55,595 --> 00:52:59,445
Speaker 1:  ways of thinking about reading. But let's start with the like curling up

868
00:52:59,445 --> 00:53:03,365
Speaker 1:  in a chair with a good book with plans to read for hours strategy.

869
00:53:03,435 --> 00:53:06,645
Speaker 1:  Like do you do that? What's your, what's your setup for how you do that?

870
00:53:07,155 --> 00:53:10,725
Speaker 10:  Well, I just wanna say like that's, yeah, clearly the most enjoyable way

871
00:53:10,725 --> 00:53:13,485
Speaker 10:  to read or really do anything, you know, it's just like, oh, it's, it's

872
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:17,245
Speaker 10:  nighttime. You're curled up with blanket, you have like a glass of whiskey,

873
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:21,045
Speaker 10:  you have a big book. You've been excited to read, a tremendous

874
00:53:21,045 --> 00:53:24,765
Speaker 10:  experience If you can somehow manufacture that on the regular

875
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:25,205
Speaker 10:  Yeah.

876
00:53:26,185 --> 00:53:29,085
Speaker 1:  Do you manufacture that on the regular? Like do you, do you carve out that

877
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:29,245
Speaker 1:  time?

878
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:32,255
Speaker 10:  No, I think it's, it's kind of impossible.

879
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:35,055
Speaker 1:  Okay. That actually makes me feel better.

880
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:39,095
Speaker 10:  Yeah. I, I think, you know, like If you have like a family, If you have

881
00:53:39,095 --> 00:53:42,695
Speaker 10:  a life, it's just, and I guess that's the other thing. There are like

882
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:46,455
Speaker 10:  ideal circumstances for reading. Sure. But If you only read when the

883
00:53:46,455 --> 00:53:49,895
Speaker 10:  circumstances are ideal, then you'll never really make it a habit

884
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:53,775
Speaker 10:  and you'll never really be disciplined about it. And I think that like anything

885
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:57,735
Speaker 10:  else, getting into a good habit requires just

886
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,815
Speaker 10:  like a little bit of discipline and just a little bit of cleverness and

887
00:54:00,855 --> 00:54:03,575
Speaker 10:  a little bit of just like letting yourself off the hook every once in a

888
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:03,735
Speaker 10:  while.

889
00:54:04,165 --> 00:54:08,015
Speaker 1:  Okay. Fair enough. But in your, in your ideal reading scenario, are you

890
00:54:08,055 --> 00:54:11,775
Speaker 1:  a, are you a Kindle guy? Are you a print guy? Are you like print out the

891
00:54:12,045 --> 00:54:15,895
Speaker 1:  PDFs and read them with a, with a marker in your hand? Like what is your

892
00:54:15,895 --> 00:54:17,135
Speaker 1:  ideal reading scenario?

893
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:21,215
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it's funny. I'm actually like all of the above. I think, you know,

894
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:25,095
Speaker 10:  if I'm in a, have that magical situation where I'm in the chair

895
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,615
Speaker 10:  with the, the fancy whiskey, yeah. I think a print book is

896
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:32,895
Speaker 10:  the thing that's easiest on my eyes for a lot of reasons. And that would

897
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:36,455
Speaker 10:  sort of be ideal. But I read probably 50% digitally as well

898
00:54:36,955 --> 00:54:40,775
Speaker 10:  for this job. I print out a lot of things and highlight

899
00:54:40,775 --> 00:54:41,655
Speaker 10:  and mark things up.

900
00:54:42,085 --> 00:54:45,375
Speaker 1:  Okay. But wait, just before I let you off the hook on, I, I do all the things

901
00:54:45,635 --> 00:54:49,575
Speaker 1:  I'm gonna, I want you to rank them for me. So there's print book, there

902
00:54:49,595 --> 00:54:53,295
Speaker 1:  is giant loose leaf pieces of eight and a half by 11 paper.

903
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:57,295
Speaker 1:  There's Kindle and there's iPad. Rank those one to four for me

904
00:54:57,515 --> 00:55:01,375
Speaker 1:  in terms of like you, you have, you have, you're gonna read for 90

905
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:02,335
Speaker 1:  consecutive minutes.

906
00:55:03,315 --> 00:55:07,215
Speaker 10:  Ooh, okay. I'm really not trying to like elude it allude the question. 'cause

907
00:55:07,215 --> 00:55:10,935
Speaker 10:  I think it does depend on the medium. Like for example, I think

908
00:55:11,005 --> 00:55:14,015
Speaker 10:  iPad is my least favorite of those. I actually think the way you listed

909
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:17,135
Speaker 10:  them, print book, loose paper,

910
00:55:17,795 --> 00:55:21,695
Speaker 10:  Kindle iPad is my ranking from like best to worst. Okay. I still

911
00:55:21,695 --> 00:55:25,575
Speaker 10:  like them all, but I actually love reading comic books on an iPad. That's

912
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,775
Speaker 10:  actually like kind of ideal for me. And I don't know what it is, but I,

913
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:32,055
Speaker 10:  I tend to retain more when I read in print. So I think there's kind of,

914
00:55:32,055 --> 00:55:36,015
Speaker 10:  that's like just what the, the spectrum is for me. But I, again, I

915
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:39,915
Speaker 10:  really think they're all valid. I think actually I

916
00:55:39,915 --> 00:55:43,275
Speaker 10:  do consider listening to audio books like reading, but I would put that

917
00:55:43,275 --> 00:55:43,675
Speaker 10:  at the bottom.

918
00:55:44,225 --> 00:55:48,035
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's fair. I think I, I agree that I, I actually don't wanna dwell

919
00:55:48,035 --> 00:55:50,795
Speaker 1:  on audiobook for too long. I realized I was preparing for this and I was

920
00:55:50,795 --> 00:55:52,475
Speaker 1:  like, should we talk about audio books? And I was like, that is a rabbit

921
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:56,315
Speaker 1:  hole. I'm not prepared to go down. But I agree audiobooks are awesome and

922
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:59,755
Speaker 1:  more people should listen to them. But it is, it is slightly different in

923
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:03,355
Speaker 1:  a way that I have like not yet quite figured out. But when I listen to a

924
00:56:03,355 --> 00:56:07,315
Speaker 1:  book and when I look at a book and read it, it

925
00:56:07,315 --> 00:56:09,915
Speaker 1:  does feel slightly different. But I think they're both okay. Different strokes.

926
00:56:09,915 --> 00:56:12,675
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. You wanna listen to books. Listen to books. My sister listens

927
00:56:12,675 --> 00:56:16,275
Speaker 1:  to audio books and is, has read more fantasy books than anyone I've ever

928
00:56:16,275 --> 00:56:19,235
Speaker 1:  met in my entire life and remembers every single thing about them. So kudos

929
00:56:19,235 --> 00:56:19,475
Speaker 1:  to her.

930
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:24,925
Speaker 1:  Where do you get your books from, both digitally and in print? Are you like,

931
00:56:25,025 --> 00:56:28,085
Speaker 1:  you get a lot of books for work so we'll, we'll throw those out, but when

932
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:31,165
Speaker 1:  you're like going looking for books, what are your, do you have good sources?

933
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:34,245
Speaker 10:  You mean like as a discovery method or where do I buy

934
00:56:34,245 --> 00:56:36,925
Speaker 1:  Them as a discovery method? Or even just If you are like, here is the secret

935
00:56:36,945 --> 00:56:39,405
Speaker 1:  to buying books for cheap that no one else knows about. Yeah,

936
00:56:39,405 --> 00:56:43,205
Speaker 10:  Well the secret to buying cheap books is to buy used books. True. We

937
00:56:43,385 --> 00:56:46,965
Speaker 10:  do a lot of eBay at our house and we actually try and read a lot of stuff

938
00:56:46,965 --> 00:56:50,645
Speaker 10:  that's out of print for some reason. So sometimes

939
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:54,485
Speaker 10:  that's the only option. But eBay e eBay's great. And then I think, you know,

940
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:58,405
Speaker 10:  occasionally I'll buy eBooks off Amazon, although

941
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:03,045
Speaker 10:  bookshop.org, which is kind of the, the indie

942
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,885
Speaker 10:  online retailer or the, the online retailer that represents all the indie

943
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:09,125
Speaker 10:  bookstores is great too. And they're, they're launching their own ebook

944
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:12,405
Speaker 10:  service pretty soon. So I think I'm gonna move all my reading there

945
00:57:12,945 --> 00:57:16,325
Speaker 10:  If you shop on Amazon, no judgment, but it's just what I choose not to do.

946
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:20,725
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And then, yeah, I, I buy a lot online from or pickup

947
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:24,645
Speaker 10:  from my local indie bookstores. So in New York books are Magic

948
00:57:24,815 --> 00:57:27,605
Speaker 10:  Greenlight Bookstore and you and me books.

949
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:31,925
Speaker 1:  Nice. I the, the one like great local

950
00:57:31,925 --> 00:57:35,885
Speaker 1:  bookstore near us just closed. Oh I've only been to it a few times and I

951
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:39,525
Speaker 1:  found it like still slightly more devastating than I expected to, to walk

952
00:57:39,525 --> 00:57:42,885
Speaker 1:  in and they're having like a 50% off sale on everything because they're just

953
00:57:42,885 --> 00:57:45,765
Speaker 1:  going outta business and really kind of pumped me out. But I also bought

954
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:47,005
Speaker 1:  a bunch of books for Half Brace.

955
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:51,685
Speaker 10:  I know, I was gonna say too, I, there was a time in my life where I was

956
00:57:51,685 --> 00:57:55,325
Speaker 10:  a lot more diligent about just like reading reviews and like just a handful

957
00:57:55,345 --> 00:57:59,165
Speaker 10:  of publications just like really being up on what was coming

958
00:57:59,165 --> 00:58:02,965
Speaker 10:  out. And somehow I would still go to, you know, McNally Jackson

959
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:08,005
Speaker 10:  and just like the display tables would have tons of fun stuff that

960
00:58:08,005 --> 00:58:11,925
Speaker 10:  you just never heard of or never think to pick up. And I don't

961
00:58:11,925 --> 00:58:15,845
Speaker 10:  know that that perusal experience still really valuable. And actually

962
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:19,365
Speaker 10:  I don't know if folks have been to a Barnes and Noble recently,

963
00:58:19,765 --> 00:58:23,645
Speaker 10:  they got kind of taken over by private equity and they kind of have

964
00:58:23,925 --> 00:58:27,285
Speaker 10:  rethought all the stores to be smaller and

965
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:31,245
Speaker 10:  they're actually much better now. Hmm. So if there's a Barnes and Noble

966
00:58:31,245 --> 00:58:34,405
Speaker 10:  near you, there's a good chance it's been sort of like revamped and the

967
00:58:34,405 --> 00:58:38,325
Speaker 10:  booksellers there are great. And I dunno, it is kind of funny as someone

968
00:58:38,325 --> 00:58:41,565
Speaker 10:  that like recently rewatched, you've got mail. It's like we used to think

969
00:58:41,565 --> 00:58:45,365
Speaker 10:  of like the Barnes and Noble as the big bad. Sure. And and clearly Amazon's

970
00:58:45,365 --> 00:58:48,565
Speaker 10:  big bad now. So now we're out there supporting Barnes and Noble, like it's

971
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:49,125
Speaker 10:  the little guy.

972
00:58:49,605 --> 00:58:52,725
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Barnes and Noble is comparatively like the, the mom and pop upstart

973
00:58:52,725 --> 00:58:53,245
Speaker 1:  bookstore.

974
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:58,325
Speaker 10:  I know, right. Maybe that should just show you how big Amazon

975
00:58:58,325 --> 00:58:59,045
Speaker 10:  is. Yeah,

976
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:01,765
Speaker 1:  I agree. So, okay, so all the way on the other side of the reading spectrum,

977
00:59:02,065 --> 00:59:05,965
Speaker 1:  you are also a big proponent of reading books on your

978
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:09,845
Speaker 1:  phone in Yes. Tiny Bursts, which I think to like a lot

979
00:59:10,165 --> 00:59:13,205
Speaker 1:  of reading purists out there is is like blasphemy.

980
00:59:14,465 --> 00:59:18,245
Speaker 1:  Why are you such a, why, how did you become such a believer in reading

981
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,165
Speaker 1:  in the Books app on your phone all the time?

982
00:59:21,085 --> 00:59:24,695
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I just think once you get into the habit of it, it's,

983
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:28,135
Speaker 10:  it's immensely satisfying sort of, you were laying out earlier, there's

984
00:59:28,135 --> 00:59:31,215
Speaker 10:  like the two modes. There's like the, you know, I, I also think there's

985
00:59:31,215 --> 00:59:34,455
Speaker 10:  like degradations between these two things. But yeah, like sitting in the

986
00:59:34,455 --> 00:59:38,415
Speaker 10:  fancy chair at night and the blanket and then I think, you know, just like

987
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:42,055
Speaker 10:  the three minutes you peel off and you're like on the toilet or whatever,

988
00:59:43,035 --> 00:59:47,015
Speaker 10:  that's, that time accumulates a lot, you know, and you

989
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:50,575
Speaker 10:  can just, especially If you commute on public transportation, like the easiest

990
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:54,465
Speaker 10:  way to just read is on your phone there in line for coffee.

991
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:58,505
Speaker 10:  And I think it also depends, I usually kind of break out the

992
00:59:58,585 --> 01:00:01,745
Speaker 10:  types of reading that I do. I would say also I'm someone that like is usually

993
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:05,505
Speaker 10:  reading two or three books at the same time. Usually I'm reading

994
01:00:05,505 --> 01:00:09,105
Speaker 10:  fiction in print 'cause I just like need to concentrate a little more on

995
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,865
Speaker 10:  that. But like, I think a non-fiction book is a little bit easier to read

996
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,945
Speaker 10:  quickly. You know, obviously depends on the kind of book, but

997
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:19,745
Speaker 10:  that's the stuff that works really well on the phone. And just like, yeah,

998
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:23,465
Speaker 10:  reading nonfiction like Three Minute Bursts I think is actually quite satisfying.

999
01:00:24,145 --> 01:00:26,865
Speaker 10:  I don't know. And I think it's kind of, it's like a little bit part of my

1000
01:00:27,105 --> 01:00:31,025
Speaker 10:  strategy that like when I wanna read, I like

1001
01:00:31,025 --> 01:00:34,825
Speaker 10:  have a couple different options that will kind of appeal to like the

1002
01:00:34,825 --> 01:00:38,505
Speaker 10:  mood that I'm in. If I'm like really ready to settle in, you know, I'll

1003
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:42,145
Speaker 10:  probably do the novel if I just like wanna read for 15 minutes,

1004
01:00:42,945 --> 01:00:46,905
Speaker 10:  probably just the nonfiction book if I really like don't know what I'm

1005
01:00:46,905 --> 01:00:49,665
Speaker 10:  in the mood for or like I'm thinking about playing video games instead.

1006
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:53,785
Speaker 10:  Probably play video games instead. But like the comic books on the iPad

1007
01:00:53,785 --> 01:00:55,705
Speaker 10:  are also like a great option too.

1008
01:00:56,415 --> 01:00:59,345
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Okay. So talk me through this rubric a little bit. 'cause I think fiction

1009
01:00:59,345 --> 01:01:03,065
Speaker 1:  versus nonfiction is an interesting way to think about it, but th this question

1010
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:06,985
Speaker 1:  of like what is a good sort of three minutes at

1011
01:01:06,985 --> 01:01:10,865
Speaker 1:  a Time book I think is actually a really key part of trying to figure this

1012
01:01:10,865 --> 01:01:13,865
Speaker 1:  out. 'cause for me, the problem I've always had when I've tried to develop

1013
01:01:13,865 --> 01:01:17,825
Speaker 1:  that habit is I'll read, I don't know, it's like a, like a Lord

1014
01:01:17,825 --> 01:01:20,385
Speaker 1:  of the Rings is actually a book I tried to read on my phone. This is years

1015
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,505
Speaker 1:  ago, but I, I still remember this so concretely. I would read it on the subway.

1016
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:27,865
Speaker 1:  I had like a 17 minute subway ride from my apartment to the verges office

1017
01:01:29,045 --> 01:01:32,865
Speaker 1:  and I would, I would read Lord of the Rings, but I would open it up and every

1018
01:01:32,865 --> 01:01:36,145
Speaker 1:  single time I'm like in the middle of a scene So I would have to back up

1019
01:01:36,185 --> 01:01:39,745
Speaker 1:  a few pages, remember where I was and by the time I'm caught up

1020
01:01:40,565 --> 01:01:44,185
Speaker 1:  I'm there. So I'm like, I'm just reading the same six pages over and over

1021
01:01:44,185 --> 01:01:46,985
Speaker 1:  and over trying to remember where I was. And I had this moment of being like,

1022
01:01:46,985 --> 01:01:50,425
Speaker 1:  okay, this is clearly the wrong kind of book to be reading in these sorts

1023
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:54,265
Speaker 1:  of increments. But how would you like delineate what makes a good

1024
01:01:54,755 --> 01:01:58,705
Speaker 1:  phone book versus what makes a good, like you need to read this

1025
01:01:58,705 --> 01:02:01,625
Speaker 1:  in in sort of larger, more concentrated chunks kind of book?

1026
01:02:02,575 --> 01:02:05,345
Speaker 10:  Yeah, that's a good question. I do think that like, yeah fiction, non-fiction

1027
01:02:05,345 --> 01:02:09,265
Speaker 10:  is a pretty clumsy way to divide it. I think you can kind of tell like there

1028
01:02:09,265 --> 01:02:12,865
Speaker 10:  are types of books that require certain kinds of concentration

1029
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:17,265
Speaker 10:  and I would read those off the phone usually. And then anything

1030
01:02:17,265 --> 01:02:20,285
Speaker 10:  that you can kind of breeze through is great for the phone.

1031
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:23,145
Speaker 10:  You know, I think what you're talking about with Lord of the Rings where

1032
01:02:23,145 --> 01:02:26,945
Speaker 10:  the scenes are long, that's probably a tough phone read even though I think

1033
01:02:26,985 --> 01:02:30,825
Speaker 10:  a lot of fantasy and genre stuff works really well for the phone, especially

1034
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:32,105
Speaker 10:  thrillers a romance.

1035
01:02:32,745 --> 01:02:36,585
Speaker 1:  I did read the Da Vinci Code on my phone and that's actually a perfect phone

1036
01:02:36,735 --> 01:02:40,265
Speaker 1:  book. Perfect. Because every chapter is like four pages long. So you just

1037
01:02:40,265 --> 01:02:43,225
Speaker 1:  like burn through two chapters, it moves really fast and then you're, and

1038
01:02:43,225 --> 01:02:45,945
Speaker 1:  then you're out and you pick it back up where you were. So like that, that's

1039
01:02:45,945 --> 01:02:48,705
Speaker 1:  the opposite of the thing I was just talking about I guess. Totally. Yeah.

1040
01:02:48,855 --> 01:02:51,585
Speaker 10:  Well yeah, I mean the genius of Dan Brown and a lot of thriller writers

1041
01:02:51,645 --> 01:02:55,465
Speaker 10:  is like, I think they capped their chapters at like a thousand

1042
01:02:55,465 --> 01:02:59,425
Speaker 10:  words or or or fewer even. So you can in

1043
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:03,265
Speaker 10:  five minutes read an entire chapter. So like you just have a self-contained

1044
01:03:03,265 --> 01:03:07,145
Speaker 10:  unit of thing. You're never jumping off in the middle of something or coming

1045
01:03:07,145 --> 01:03:10,305
Speaker 10:  back in the middle of it If you kind of time your stuff. Right. So yeah,

1046
01:03:10,305 --> 01:03:13,545
Speaker 10:  obviously perfect phone books. Yeah, I think the commute is just such an

1047
01:03:13,865 --> 01:03:17,625
Speaker 10:  interesting like unit of time because it's both

1048
01:03:17,655 --> 01:03:21,625
Speaker 10:  very distracting but also I think on people's commutes, like all

1049
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:25,025
Speaker 10:  they wanna do is distract themselves from everything that's around them.

1050
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:26,825
Speaker 10:  Maybe that's a New York 70 thing, but

1051
01:03:27,495 --> 01:03:30,585
Speaker 1:  Yeah, no, I, I, I agree with that and I think I'm thinking about a lot of,

1052
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:34,745
Speaker 1:  like, a lot of the books that I end up reading for work purposes are

1053
01:03:34,745 --> 01:03:38,225
Speaker 1:  like somewhere between kind of journalistic

1054
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:42,145
Speaker 1:  nonfiction and like self-help. Like I just read Cal Newport's new

1055
01:03:42,145 --> 01:03:45,745
Speaker 1:  book, which is basically all about like how to be better at work and not

1056
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:49,185
Speaker 1:  lose your mind on the internet. And it is sort of a, it's it's chunks of

1057
01:03:49,735 --> 01:03:53,665
Speaker 1:  helpful information at a time and that to me is like a perfect phone book

1058
01:03:53,665 --> 01:03:56,745
Speaker 1:  because it's like each one of those things is helpful and I go through and

1059
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:59,865
Speaker 1:  I highlight it, but it's kind of just like a bunch of articles in a row and

1060
01:03:59,865 --> 01:04:03,825
Speaker 1:  that that feels good. Whereas a lot

1061
01:04:03,825 --> 01:04:07,785
Speaker 1:  of these other books that I, I end up forgetting where I am if I haven't

1062
01:04:07,785 --> 01:04:11,065
Speaker 1:  read it in a couple of days is like that's the wrong thing to read on my

1063
01:04:11,065 --> 01:04:11,505
Speaker 1:  son. I think.

1064
01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:15,865
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I think it also becomes like pretty hard with fiction to jump in and

1065
01:04:15,865 --> 01:04:19,305
Speaker 10:  out of a, of a scene in particular. Yeah. 'cause you just like kind of,

1066
01:04:19,365 --> 01:04:22,745
Speaker 10:  you know, with a, I think a nonfiction book is generally like

1067
01:04:23,095 --> 01:04:26,905
Speaker 10:  kind of like guiding you and kind of telling you what it's about

1068
01:04:27,565 --> 01:04:31,305
Speaker 10:  in most cases at all times and reminding you and then in fiction, you know,

1069
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:34,705
Speaker 10:  like I think it often literary fiction is like trying to

1070
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:38,265
Speaker 10:  destabilize you or confuse you for effect and

1071
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,225
Speaker 10:  it's probably working and it's probably not a great effect on the subway.

1072
01:04:42,055 --> 01:04:43,065
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's very fair.

1073
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:47,985
Speaker 1:  What apps do you use for reading on your phone? Either just for reading or

1074
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:51,065
Speaker 1:  for like book management stuff in general? One of the things I was gonna

1075
01:04:51,065 --> 01:04:54,985
Speaker 1:  ask you about is if you're a person who like tracks all of your reading in

1076
01:04:54,985 --> 01:04:57,905
Speaker 1:  any specific way, so like what's your reading setup on your phone?

1077
01:04:58,635 --> 01:05:02,405
Speaker 10:  Yeah, in terms of tracking, I actually, I kind of go in and out of

1078
01:05:02,605 --> 01:05:05,885
Speaker 10:  tracking what I read. So I'm trying to be better about it in

1079
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:10,325
Speaker 10:  2025. But I dunno, I, I kind of don't keep track 'cause I

1080
01:05:10,325 --> 01:05:13,405
Speaker 10:  used to, like, there were times when I, I felt like I needed to like keep

1081
01:05:13,405 --> 01:05:17,205
Speaker 10:  up a certain pace, especially for certain kinds of research and I've been

1082
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:20,885
Speaker 10:  out of that for a while. So I don't know, I, I read a lot on my own So I

1083
01:05:20,885 --> 01:05:24,605
Speaker 10:  don't need to to motivate myself in that way. But you know, I actually think

1084
01:05:24,605 --> 01:05:27,925
Speaker 10:  this, there's so many like apps to track things. It's just like the best

1085
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:31,005
Speaker 10:  thing you can do is just keep track of things in like your favorite notes

1086
01:05:31,025 --> 01:05:34,885
Speaker 10:  app. Like just don't overcomplicate it. It doesn't need to link

1087
01:05:35,085 --> 01:05:38,965
Speaker 10:  to anything. The more rigid the thing is, I

1088
01:05:39,165 --> 01:05:42,085
Speaker 10:  actually think the less likely you are or the more likely you are to like

1089
01:05:42,085 --> 01:05:46,045
Speaker 10:  fall off of it. So, and in terms of apps, again, I'm actually like pretty

1090
01:05:46,185 --> 01:05:50,125
Speaker 10:  unsophisticated. I read a lot in the Kindle app. I actually send a lot

1091
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:53,765
Speaker 10:  of files to the Kindle app. There's like a super janky

1092
01:05:54,195 --> 01:05:57,965
Speaker 10:  beta get files onto your Kindle via

1093
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,365
Speaker 10:  email.

1094
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:02,485
Speaker 1:  I have said to people for years that the one job in the tech industry that

1095
01:06:02,545 --> 01:06:06,525
Speaker 1:  I'm interested in is going and being the product manager of Send

1096
01:06:06,525 --> 01:06:09,765
Speaker 1:  to Kindle and just make it, what If you just made it good? What if it was

1097
01:06:09,785 --> 01:06:12,445
Speaker 1:  you could just take a link and send it to the Kindle and then read that article

1098
01:06:12,565 --> 01:06:16,045
Speaker 1:  in your Kindle. Like what if that worked? I would, I would, I would do that

1099
01:06:16,045 --> 01:06:18,805
Speaker 1:  and then they would elect me King of the world and then everything would

1100
01:06:18,805 --> 01:06:19,285
Speaker 1:  be fantastic.

1101
01:06:20,445 --> 01:06:24,365
Speaker 10:  I just like, but it sucks. I mean am Amazon is like the funniest company

1102
01:06:24,365 --> 01:06:28,125
Speaker 10:  when it comes to just product. Like the Kindle experience has

1103
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:31,845
Speaker 10:  clearly not been cared after for a long time and everything like

1104
01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:35,645
Speaker 10:  kind of works but is super janky. Actually I, this is obviously a very

1105
01:06:35,885 --> 01:06:39,325
Speaker 10:  specific use case, which is why it's not very well supported. But I was

1106
01:06:39,325 --> 01:06:42,565
Speaker 10:  trying to actually, I was reading David Burns how Music Works,

1107
01:06:43,195 --> 01:06:45,965
Speaker 10:  it's a tremendous book and I was highlighting a lot and I was like, oh,

1108
01:06:45,985 --> 01:06:49,525
Speaker 10:  I'd actually like to save some of these quotes in a doc. So I like

1109
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:53,845
Speaker 10:  was trying to export the annotations or the highlights that I had made

1110
01:06:54,145 --> 01:06:57,565
Speaker 10:  and it was like erroring out. It was like, you do not have an email associated

1111
01:06:57,565 --> 01:07:00,845
Speaker 10:  with your Amazon account. Just not true. And then I was googling around

1112
01:07:00,865 --> 01:07:03,965
Speaker 10:  and then it turns out the issue, and this is extremely specific, is that

1113
01:07:04,365 --> 01:07:08,245
Speaker 10:  I didn't have an email address set up on the default mail app in

1114
01:07:08,505 --> 01:07:08,725
Speaker 10:  iOS.

1115
01:07:09,315 --> 01:07:09,845
Speaker 1:  Good lord.

1116
01:07:10,515 --> 01:07:13,685
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Like it didn't understand that I like used the Gmail app like a lot

1117
01:07:13,685 --> 01:07:17,365
Speaker 10:  of people. Yeah. So I like actually had to set up mail for the first time

1118
01:07:18,155 --> 01:07:22,045
Speaker 10:  just So I could export these David Burn quotes and it's just like,

1119
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:26,645
Speaker 10:  at what point was that ever a solution? Like I'm sure they

1120
01:07:26,645 --> 01:07:30,405
Speaker 10:  haven't updated in a long time, but like they shipped it like that, you

1121
01:07:30,405 --> 01:07:34,325
Speaker 10:  know? Yeah. So anyway, you're asking me on apps, oh and

1122
01:07:34,325 --> 01:07:38,285
Speaker 10:  then I, I read a lot of PDFs in Dropbox, so just truly

1123
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:40,765
Speaker 10:  like in elegant solutions to everything but, well

1124
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,485
Speaker 1:  I, you're making me wonder if the

1125
01:07:44,145 --> 01:07:48,005
Speaker 1:  not being precious about it is maybe part of the point. And I think I,

1126
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:50,885
Speaker 1:  I'm realizing now that this is kind of a trap that I have fallen into too,

1127
01:07:50,885 --> 01:07:54,605
Speaker 1:  which is like I am, I get really annoyed about how

1128
01:07:54,605 --> 01:07:58,405
Speaker 1:  apps scroll, which is a really stupid thing to say, but like the iBooks

1129
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:01,885
Speaker 1:  or the Apple Books scrolling animation annoys me. So I don't use the app.

1130
01:08:02,065 --> 01:08:05,525
Speaker 1:  And then a lot of, a lot of things, like a lot of the read later apps

1131
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:09,365
Speaker 1:  just make you vertically scroll, which is fine for like a web article, but

1132
01:08:09,365 --> 01:08:12,605
Speaker 1:  I hate for really long things. I want something that feels like pages and

1133
01:08:12,605 --> 01:08:15,605
Speaker 1:  So I end up using the Kindle app just because it's like a slightly better

1134
01:08:15,665 --> 01:08:19,125
Speaker 1:  app. And I'm realizing now that like the more precious you are about how

1135
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:22,885
Speaker 1:  all this works, the worse it actually is because if I got a PDF in

1136
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:26,845
Speaker 1:  Dropbox that was a book, there is a 0% chance I would read that book

1137
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:30,405
Speaker 1:  truly. Like, and I'm not proud of that, but it's true. It would just irritate

1138
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:34,245
Speaker 1:  me that the, the, you know, margins were too big and I would not read the

1139
01:08:34,245 --> 01:08:37,725
Speaker 1:  book. But I think getting past that might be a key to doing this. Well

1140
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:41,245
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I mean I, every time I open the Kindle app I'm just like appalled

1141
01:08:41,245 --> 01:08:45,085
Speaker 10:  by the typeface choices. Like every time just, I'm somehow like shocked

1142
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:48,885
Speaker 10:  every time and just the way it's like, it's, it's like justified width,

1143
01:08:48,885 --> 01:08:51,205
Speaker 10:  which just looks like horrible on the phone and Oh

1144
01:08:51,205 --> 01:08:51,605
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's awful.

1145
01:08:52,105 --> 01:08:53,885
Speaker 10:  And we, and we just, you know, we persist.

1146
01:08:54,785 --> 01:08:56,205
Speaker 1:  That's true. It's, it's good for us

1147
01:08:56,275 --> 01:08:56,765
Speaker 10:  Bravely.

1148
01:08:57,545 --> 01:09:00,685
Speaker 1:  Yes we are, we are, you know, out here doing the hard work.

1149
01:09:02,025 --> 01:09:05,605
Speaker 1:  You're also a big proponent of, of quitting books, which I think if, if we

1150
01:09:05,605 --> 01:09:09,255
Speaker 1:  give people one tip on how to read more books, I actually think quit

1151
01:09:09,265 --> 01:09:13,175
Speaker 1:  books quickly and without feeling bad about it might

1152
01:09:13,175 --> 01:09:15,535
Speaker 1:  be the best tip. Yeah.

1153
01:09:16,535 --> 01:09:20,505
Speaker 10:  I like, I it just, I mean here's the thing, like a lot of

1154
01:09:20,835 --> 01:09:24,105
Speaker 10:  stuff, especially if you're reading fiction like, or books that are like

1155
01:09:24,105 --> 01:09:26,825
Speaker 10:  a little more challenging, there's also quite challenging nonfiction. You

1156
01:09:26,825 --> 01:09:30,755
Speaker 10:  know, If you read the Power Broker, like you're gonna

1157
01:09:30,755 --> 01:09:33,555
Speaker 10:  have to get more than five pages in before you decide to quit, you know,

1158
01:09:33,595 --> 01:09:37,035
Speaker 10:  I think Sure. But I think you should just set like pretty clear

1159
01:09:37,435 --> 01:09:41,355
Speaker 10:  thresholds for yourself and I understand the idea of, you know,

1160
01:09:41,535 --> 01:09:45,115
Speaker 10:  you bought a book, you should finish it. I dunno, I just dunno if I subscribe

1161
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:48,835
Speaker 10:  to that. 'cause one like it's nice to buy books, they're not that

1162
01:09:48,835 --> 01:09:51,595
Speaker 10:  expensive in the grand scheme of things. Especially you can buy used books

1163
01:09:51,695 --> 01:09:55,435
Speaker 10:  and then like two, you know, you're supporting an industry that could use

1164
01:09:55,435 --> 01:09:59,155
Speaker 10:  that support. And then three also there's always the library so you have

1165
01:09:59,155 --> 01:10:02,595
Speaker 10:  an unlimited stream of free things that you can be reading at any time.

1166
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,315
Speaker 1:  Yeah, yeah. The other thing we should probably say here is that Libby, the

1167
01:10:06,315 --> 01:10:09,715
Speaker 1:  app is a wonderful thing that more people should take advantage of with the

1168
01:10:09,715 --> 01:10:11,595
Speaker 1:  library card. It is fabulous,

1169
01:10:11,905 --> 01:10:15,755
Speaker 10:  Just like a lot of things once you get that sucker set up, it works

1170
01:10:15,755 --> 01:10:19,275
Speaker 10:  like a dream, but it is a little bit fidget to set up. It is actually like

1171
01:10:19,275 --> 01:10:22,675
Speaker 10:  a lot of reading stuff is fidgety to set up. For example, you know,

1172
01:10:23,255 --> 01:10:26,715
Speaker 10:  I'm a Book's Palmer Convert because of you. So I do read on a,

1173
01:10:27,415 --> 01:10:31,195
Speaker 10:  on an e Ink device that is phone sized, which I, which I like quite a lot.

1174
01:10:31,295 --> 01:10:34,235
Speaker 1:  How do you like the Palmer, you were, you were apprehensive when you first

1175
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:37,155
Speaker 1:  were thinking about getting it and we haven't really talked about it since

1176
01:10:37,155 --> 01:10:37,915
Speaker 1:  you got it. What do you think?

1177
01:10:38,505 --> 01:10:42,475
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I, I know I, I quite like it. I think just on principle one, the

1178
01:10:42,475 --> 01:10:45,915
Speaker 10:  thing is still too expensive. It's, it's like nuts that it's what,

1179
01:10:45,915 --> 01:10:47,035
Speaker 10:  $200 or whatever,

1180
01:10:47,225 --> 01:10:49,915
Speaker 1:  It's at least twice as expensive as it should be.

1181
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:53,995
Speaker 10:  And it really is like pretty crummy hardware and software like through

1182
01:10:53,995 --> 01:10:57,555
Speaker 10:  and through it is just a clever form factor that works and it just mostly

1183
01:10:57,555 --> 01:11:01,075
Speaker 10:  works. And yeah, once I got kind of some of the settings

1184
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:05,395
Speaker 10:  figured out, like I had to go to Reddit for some good defaults. But yeah,

1185
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:09,235
Speaker 10:  I use this thing every day, although I run into software

1186
01:11:09,235 --> 01:11:13,205
Speaker 10:  bugs on it all the time, it's like weird to side load things onto it. I

1187
01:11:13,205 --> 01:11:16,925
Speaker 10:  dunno if you're having this issue, like I feel like the plastic on my book's

1188
01:11:16,925 --> 01:11:20,445
Speaker 10:  Palma is like yellowing. Oh yeah. Just looks kind of disgusting.

1189
01:11:20,555 --> 01:11:24,125
Speaker 1:  There's a real like patina thing happening that I'm not wild about,

1190
01:11:24,425 --> 01:11:24,645
Speaker 1:  but

1191
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:28,085
Speaker 10:  Patina is like the really generous way to describe what is happening to

1192
01:11:28,085 --> 01:11:31,965
Speaker 10:  the plastic on that phone. Fair. But yeah, I, so

1193
01:11:31,965 --> 01:11:35,825
Speaker 10:  it just felt like a weird amount of money to spend on something like

1194
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:39,785
Speaker 10:  that. But that said, you know, I use it every day. So that thing has

1195
01:11:39,785 --> 01:11:42,865
Speaker 10:  amortized in value. Yeah. Big fan. Okay.

1196
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:47,145
Speaker 1:  And I mean I've gotten, I, I really did not intend to

1197
01:11:47,145 --> 01:11:50,945
Speaker 1:  become like America's number one proponent of the book's Palmer a device

1198
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:53,225
Speaker 1:  that I think has so, so, so many flaws.

1199
01:11:54,885 --> 01:11:58,745
Speaker 1:  But the question I get from people a lot is A, whether

1200
01:11:58,745 --> 01:12:02,505
Speaker 1:  they should buy that device and B, whether a dedicated reading

1201
01:12:02,505 --> 01:12:05,545
Speaker 1:  device is worth it at all. Right. And I think like the Kindle

1202
01:12:06,525 --> 01:12:10,425
Speaker 1:  is cheap enough that I think it, it kind of, it's,

1203
01:12:10,425 --> 01:12:12,865
Speaker 1:  people don't worry about it the same way. Like the base kindle's like 60

1204
01:12:12,865 --> 01:12:16,505
Speaker 1:  bucks and you can often find it on sale. Like that's not a, a sort of

1205
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:19,625
Speaker 1:  investment in reading the way that like a Book's Palm is an investment in

1206
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:23,105
Speaker 1:  reading like thing's almost $300. It's very expensive and the bet you're

1207
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,825
Speaker 1:  making is like, I'm going to have this with me a lot and it is going to be

1208
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:29,305
Speaker 1:  a device that I use on purpose. And I wonder, especially coming from the

1209
01:12:29,305 --> 01:12:32,825
Speaker 1:  way you're thinking about it, which is that like the way to read more is

1210
01:12:32,825 --> 01:12:35,585
Speaker 1:  to not be precious about it and to have it around all the time and to have

1211
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:38,425
Speaker 1:  lots of books going at a time that you can just kind of flit in and out of

1212
01:12:38,425 --> 01:12:41,865
Speaker 1:  as you have moments if the idea of having a

1213
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:45,265
Speaker 1:  dedicated reading device is actually maybe pulling you

1214
01:12:45,655 --> 01:12:48,745
Speaker 1:  away from some of the things that might make you read more.

1215
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:53,045
Speaker 10:  That's a great question. I also just wanna say that like your average Kindle

1216
01:12:53,045 --> 01:12:56,525
Speaker 10:  device that's like cerebral years old is probably a better piece of hardware

1217
01:12:56,525 --> 01:12:57,325
Speaker 10:  than the books Palm.

1218
01:12:57,905 --> 01:12:59,365
Speaker 1:  Oh, unquestionably. Yeah.

1219
01:12:59,825 --> 01:13:03,805
Speaker 10:  But obviously If you wanna be slightly more of a power user and side

1220
01:13:03,805 --> 01:13:07,365
Speaker 10:  load things, like I was saying, I'm like reading PDFs of books that are

1221
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:11,605
Speaker 10:  out print, things like that. Yeah. Then yeah, like the books Palma is

1222
01:13:11,605 --> 01:13:15,365
Speaker 10:  pretty great for that. I dunno, I I I say this like I've been such a snob

1223
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:17,965
Speaker 10:  this whole time about like, oh it's so easy to read. I have all these systems,

1224
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:21,965
Speaker 10:  but no, it's like still easy for me to get distracted on my phone. So

1225
01:13:22,165 --> 01:13:26,005
Speaker 10:  I do like having the Palma for that reason. Like just

1226
01:13:26,005 --> 01:13:29,845
Speaker 10:  nothing even, you know, even on Do Not Disturb mode, you're just like, well

1227
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:33,805
Speaker 10:  let me just check my email. And then, yeah, the Palma is so funny

1228
01:13:33,805 --> 01:13:37,685
Speaker 10:  because it just like the suckiness of the os and the slowness of

1229
01:13:37,685 --> 01:13:41,285
Speaker 10:  it and the jenness of everything else, it just like, you are not gonna wanna

1230
01:13:41,305 --> 01:13:44,405
Speaker 10:  do anything else on that phone except read Buster, you know?

1231
01:13:44,535 --> 01:13:45,805
Speaker 1:  Truly. Yeah. So

1232
01:13:46,245 --> 01:13:46,885
Speaker 10:  I like idea.

1233
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:48,845
Speaker 1:  So I think the badness is the, is the point. Yeah.

1234
01:13:49,155 --> 01:13:49,445
Speaker 10:  Yeah.

1235
01:13:50,985 --> 01:13:54,445
Speaker 10:  And you know, like I'm not, I know we call them like dumb phones or whatever.

1236
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:57,605
Speaker 10:  I don't know, I don't know if I like prescribe to all of that necessarily,

1237
01:13:57,825 --> 01:14:01,645
Speaker 10:  but I can just say like personally I have read

1238
01:14:01,655 --> 01:14:05,205
Speaker 10:  quite a lot on the books Palma and I enjoy that experience and I use this

1239
01:14:05,205 --> 01:14:08,765
Speaker 10:  device far more than I thought I would. I I got it in a lark 'cause like

1240
01:14:08,765 --> 01:14:12,365
Speaker 10:  my tax return came in and I was just like, yeah, I guess I trust David

1241
01:14:12,385 --> 01:14:15,965
Speaker 10:  enough to spend $200 or whatever. And

1242
01:14:16,245 --> 01:14:17,805
Speaker 10:  yeah, it pains me to say, you are right.

1243
01:14:18,205 --> 01:14:21,845
Speaker 1:  I mean I really, I appreciate that my legacy is this crappy

1244
01:14:21,985 --> 01:14:25,485
Speaker 1:  gadget that is nevertheless like the thing we need in our lives. I feel good

1245
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:27,005
Speaker 1:  about that. I love that

1246
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:29,965
Speaker 10:  You're like your best, like, you're like your legacy is like pushing like

1247
01:14:30,085 --> 01:14:32,205
Speaker 10:  a seven out of 10 device on the world.

1248
01:14:32,715 --> 01:14:35,885
Speaker 1:  Seriously. Great. I'm, I'm happy to have helped.

1249
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:40,285
Speaker 1:  Last thing and then I'll let you go. I'm curious, you're also an author,

1250
01:14:40,285 --> 01:14:43,965
Speaker 1:  you've written, you've written one book that's very good and you just wrote

1251
01:14:43,965 --> 01:14:45,965
Speaker 1:  another that I think is like just about to come out, right?

1252
01:14:46,355 --> 01:14:47,485
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it's out in April.

1253
01:14:48,035 --> 01:14:49,285
Speaker 1:  Okay. What's it called? Tell the People.

1254
01:14:50,195 --> 01:14:54,085
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it's called My Documents. It's a novel. So, you know,

1255
01:14:54,085 --> 01:14:56,885
Speaker 10:  it's funny, it's, I'm like three months out and I'm still having a hard

1256
01:14:56,885 --> 01:15:00,445
Speaker 10:  time describing it accurately. But the plot is,

1257
01:15:01,145 --> 01:15:05,005
Speaker 10:  it imagines a bunch of, well imagines a world where a not too distant

1258
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:08,685
Speaker 10:  world where the US decides to lock up

1259
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:13,125
Speaker 10:  incarcerate all Vietnamese Americans kind of as an echo of Japanese

1260
01:15:13,405 --> 01:15:17,365
Speaker 10:  incarceration, which happened in World War ii. The weird thing when I

1261
01:15:17,365 --> 01:15:20,925
Speaker 10:  talk about this is it makes the book sound like really

1262
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:25,085
Speaker 10:  bleak. A lot of the book is like Zoomers trying to like

1263
01:15:25,675 --> 01:15:28,725
Speaker 10:  live their life without the internet while they're in camp. So it's like

1264
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:29,445
Speaker 10:  also kind of funny.

1265
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:29,925
Speaker 1:  I

1266
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:33,885
Speaker 10:  Like it. It's like, I think very quietly or maybe not so quietly a tech

1267
01:15:33,885 --> 01:15:34,805
Speaker 10:  novel. So,

1268
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:38,765
Speaker 1:  Okay, I like it. You are like,

1269
01:15:38,765 --> 01:15:42,645
Speaker 1:  you spend your day job thinking about like how people read digital things

1270
01:15:42,665 --> 01:15:46,405
Speaker 1:  on the internet and then you write books. And I'm curious like,

1271
01:15:46,405 --> 01:15:49,725
Speaker 1:  especially as somebody who has like, thought this deeply about how we read

1272
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:53,325
Speaker 1:  and how we consume this stuff and how technology is part of all of this.

1273
01:15:53,915 --> 01:15:57,765
Speaker 1:  Like, do you think about what, how people are going to read your book

1274
01:15:57,765 --> 01:16:01,205
Speaker 1:  when you're writing a book? Like is, are you like, this is a book that you

1275
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:05,045
Speaker 1:  should buy and print and read with covers and fancy whiskey? Or are you like

1276
01:16:05,045 --> 01:16:07,565
Speaker 1:  sitting there being like, okay, I have to make the chapters shorter because

1277
01:16:07,805 --> 01:16:09,445
Speaker 1:  somebody's gonna be reading this on the subway on the way to work.

1278
01:16:10,635 --> 01:16:14,405
Speaker 10:  It's a little bit less like imagining where people are or what device

1279
01:16:14,405 --> 01:16:17,925
Speaker 10:  they'll be on when they're reading, but we both have like

1280
01:16:17,995 --> 01:16:21,965
Speaker 10:  backgrounds in print magazines and I think there's a way of thinking

1281
01:16:21,965 --> 01:16:25,405
Speaker 10:  about the reader or the audience when you work in print for some reason,

1282
01:16:25,725 --> 01:16:29,445
Speaker 10:  especially If you work on features. You know, these stories are like five

1283
01:16:29,745 --> 01:16:33,605
Speaker 10:  to 10,000 words at times and there's just sort of this sense like

1284
01:16:33,605 --> 01:16:37,045
Speaker 10:  you just kind of wanna keep things pretty dynamic. Like you just don't want

1285
01:16:37,045 --> 01:16:40,925
Speaker 10:  like long chunks of exposition, right? Like you wanna move from like

1286
01:16:41,265 --> 01:16:44,565
Speaker 10:  scenes to dialogue to exposition and back and

1287
01:16:45,425 --> 01:16:48,885
Speaker 10:  you know, you get to think about like layout in a magazine. You don't really

1288
01:16:48,885 --> 01:16:52,325
Speaker 10:  get to do that in a book. But I think that was like in my brain as I was

1289
01:16:52,325 --> 01:16:56,085
Speaker 10:  writing. Like I just wanted, I just like wanted things to feel active.

1290
01:16:56,085 --> 01:16:59,925
Speaker 10:  There's like lots of different textures and actually I, I kept

1291
01:16:59,925 --> 01:17:03,045
Speaker 10:  all the chapters pretty short as well. So it was like a little Dan Brown

1292
01:17:03,045 --> 01:17:03,685
Speaker 10:  in me I guess.

1293
01:17:04,865 --> 01:17:08,805
Speaker 1:  Are you non precious as an author? Like when somebody sends you a, a photo

1294
01:17:08,805 --> 01:17:12,565
Speaker 1:  of themselves, like reading your book on a, on a crowded

1295
01:17:12,565 --> 01:17:15,525
Speaker 1:  subway, are you like that's not the right way to read new waves?

1296
01:17:16,785 --> 01:17:20,685
Speaker 10:  No, no. I would be delighted. I, well I am

1297
01:17:20,685 --> 01:17:24,365
Speaker 10:  delighted anytime that happens, I still have yet to see anyone

1298
01:17:24,365 --> 01:17:28,285
Speaker 10:  reading my book like out in the wild. That's like kind of a

1299
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:31,845
Speaker 10:  dream scenario for me. Totally. I've definitely had friends like

1300
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:34,925
Speaker 10:  send me photos of people like creep shotting on the subway

1301
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:39,885
Speaker 10:  and I dunno about the ethics of creep shotting, but please keep sending

1302
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:41,125
Speaker 10:  me those. I appreciate it.

1303
01:17:42,045 --> 01:17:45,845
Speaker 1:  I like it. Okay, last thing and then truly I'm done with you. Do you honestly

1304
01:17:45,845 --> 01:17:48,845
Speaker 1:  read books during commercial breaks? Is that a, you, you wrote this GQ article

1305
01:17:48,885 --> 01:17:51,965
Speaker 1:  a bunch of years ago and that was one of the things you said and the article's

1306
01:17:51,965 --> 01:17:54,205
Speaker 1:  very good and I'll link to it in the show notes and I think the advice like

1307
01:17:54,205 --> 01:17:56,885
Speaker 1:  really holds up even all these years later and it's some of the stuff we've

1308
01:17:56,885 --> 01:18:00,165
Speaker 1:  talked about, but you just say very casually that you read books during commercial

1309
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:03,965
Speaker 1:  breaks, which is like unhinged to me and I'm, I'm very

1310
01:18:03,965 --> 01:18:05,485
Speaker 1:  curious about this. Do you really do that?

1311
01:18:06,445 --> 01:18:09,845
Speaker 10:  I really do do this. It's funny, I was watching a little bit of the Australia

1312
01:18:09,845 --> 01:18:12,725
Speaker 10:  note open before we jumped on this call and

1313
01:18:13,595 --> 01:18:16,605
Speaker 10:  yeah like I forgot like it's actually imss, it's like hard to do it during

1314
01:18:16,605 --> 01:18:20,365
Speaker 10:  tennis 'cause commercial breaks are so much shorter. But like during an

1315
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:24,325
Speaker 10:  NFL game there are so many goddamn ads and they're all for DraftKings

1316
01:18:24,465 --> 01:18:28,205
Speaker 10:  or Burger King. And so it just like, I don't know honestly, like

1317
01:18:28,305 --> 01:18:31,885
Speaker 10:  you might have to read during commercial breaks to like just press mute

1318
01:18:32,105 --> 01:18:35,765
Speaker 10:  for like your own fucking sanity. Yeah. But reading like

1319
01:18:36,285 --> 01:18:39,205
Speaker 10:  a book, you know, three or four minutes at a time and it's like how long

1320
01:18:39,205 --> 01:18:43,045
Speaker 10:  these ad breaks are. It's nuts. Yeah. And again, I, you know,

1321
01:18:43,045 --> 01:18:46,525
Speaker 10:  I'm usually reading on the phone and something kind of breezy and

1322
01:18:46,665 --> 01:18:50,125
Speaker 10:  likely nonfiction, So I really do do that. Maybe that's a little

1323
01:18:50,505 --> 01:18:52,925
Speaker 10:  bit too far advice wise for people, but

1324
01:18:53,365 --> 01:18:56,005
Speaker 1:  I kind of love it. I was actually thinking about it last night because I

1325
01:18:56,005 --> 01:18:59,645
Speaker 1:  was realizing that my instinct when there's like,

1326
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:02,965
Speaker 1:  you know, I have three minutes of downtime when it's, whenever it's like,

1327
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:07,005
Speaker 1:  you know, Anna pauses the movie to go into the kitchen and get something

1328
01:19:07,065 --> 01:19:10,965
Speaker 1:  or like it's commercials or whatever, I either open TikTok or Reddit

1329
01:19:11,075 --> 01:19:14,285
Speaker 1:  like a hundred percent of the time I realize it's one of those two apps because

1330
01:19:14,285 --> 01:19:18,165
Speaker 1:  it's like you, you can do it for any amount of time. It doesn't, it you can

1331
01:19:18,165 --> 01:19:20,925
Speaker 1:  just sort of open and close it and however long you're there is fine.

1332
01:19:21,945 --> 01:19:25,725
Speaker 1:  And I am, I, my goal is to replace that instinct with opening

1333
01:19:25,785 --> 01:19:28,845
Speaker 1:  the Kindle app. And I think that is like, that was my main takeaway from

1334
01:19:28,845 --> 01:19:32,805
Speaker 1:  thinking about this is like just the, the, I have three minutes right

1335
01:19:32,805 --> 01:19:35,525
Speaker 1:  now instead of opening one of those two apps, I'm gonna try to read

1336
01:19:36,825 --> 01:19:40,685
Speaker 1:  one page of a book and just see how far that gets me. And I think the alarming

1337
01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:44,205
Speaker 1:  thing is I think that's going to get me a lot further than I am

1338
01:19:44,205 --> 01:19:47,245
Speaker 1:  reckoning with because I think I spend a lot of time in TikTok that I don't

1339
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:49,925
Speaker 1:  necessarily clock as time I'm spending in TikTok.

1340
01:19:50,515 --> 01:19:53,205
Speaker 10:  Yeah. So, you know, someone's told me recently that they deleted TikTok

1341
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:57,165
Speaker 10:  from their phone and they only have it on their iPad, which seems kind of

1342
01:19:57,165 --> 01:19:59,805
Speaker 10:  nuts, but I kind of like, it's like, oh, you actually have to be a little

1343
01:19:59,805 --> 01:20:03,125
Speaker 10:  more deliberate when you open TikTok. I don't even know if they have a dedicated

1344
01:20:03,315 --> 01:20:06,245
Speaker 10:  iPad app. I almost hope it's like kind of the miniature when it gets like

1345
01:20:06,245 --> 01:20:06,685
Speaker 10:  blown up.

1346
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,085
Speaker 1:  Just expanse. Yeah.

1347
01:20:08,155 --> 01:20:10,645
Speaker 10:  Full width. Just like, oh actually just like Instagram. Right,

1348
01:20:11,005 --> 01:20:11,325
Speaker 1:  Right.

1349
01:20:12,905 --> 01:20:16,245
Speaker 10:  But yeah, we should, we should check it in a few months and see if this

1350
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:17,085
Speaker 10:  track works for you.

1351
01:20:17,635 --> 01:20:20,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah, well I'll, I'll keep you posted for sure. I feel like the first thing

1352
01:20:20,205 --> 01:20:24,125
Speaker 1:  I have to do is find the right phone book to start and then I'm

1353
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:26,085
Speaker 1:  gonna see how long it takes me to get through it. But I'll, I'll keep you

1354
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:26,805
Speaker 1:  posted. We'll keep talking.

1355
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:27,525
Speaker 10:  Cool.

1356
01:20:28,315 --> 01:20:31,255
Speaker 1:  All right Kevin, thank you. Yeah, thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.

1357
01:20:31,405 --> 01:20:33,815
Speaker 1:  Good luck to everybody who wants to read more and If you have reading tips

1358
01:20:34,175 --> 01:20:36,615
Speaker 1:  send them to us. I would like to hear everybody's reading tips 'cause we're

1359
01:20:36,615 --> 01:20:38,615
Speaker 1:  all gonna read more this year. It's gonna be awesome. Thanks Kevin.

1360
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:39,415
Speaker 10:  See you David.

1361
01:20:41,155 --> 01:20:44,415
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take one more break and then we will be back with a question

1362
01:20:44,415 --> 01:20:46,375
Speaker 1:  from The Vergecast hotline. We'll be right back.

1363
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,425
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the hotline as always. The number is

1364
01:22:26,425 --> 01:22:30,385
Speaker 1:  8 6 6 VERGE one one. The email is vergecast at The Verge dot com. We

1365
01:22:30,385 --> 01:22:33,105
Speaker 1:  love all of your questions and we try to answer at least one on the show

1366
01:22:33,105 --> 01:22:37,065
Speaker 1:  every week. I should say the hotline app

1367
01:22:37,065 --> 01:22:40,785
Speaker 1:  that we use got kind of broken for a few days there, so

1368
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:44,425
Speaker 1:  it's possible that we missed some of your calls last week.

1369
01:22:45,165 --> 01:22:48,105
Speaker 1:  I'm hopeful that we didn't and we'll be able to get to them. But If you called

1370
01:22:48,105 --> 01:22:51,945
Speaker 1:  last week and asked a question, there's a chance we didn't get it. So

1371
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:56,185
Speaker 1:  a I am sorry and b call again, I still wanna hear all of your questions and

1372
01:22:56,255 --> 01:22:59,625
Speaker 1:  hopefully this stupid app doesn't break again this week.

1373
01:23:00,045 --> 01:23:01,945
Speaker 1:  We have a question about audio.

1374
01:23:03,565 --> 01:23:07,365
Speaker 11:  Hi, my name's Dan. I got a weird one. I guess it's not that weird.

1375
01:23:07,985 --> 01:23:11,725
Speaker 11:  Why can't I listen to a podcast in music at the same time on my phone I

1376
01:23:11,725 --> 01:23:15,525
Speaker 11:  get like, you know, like 15 years ago when the iPhone was first coming

1377
01:23:15,525 --> 01:23:19,125
Speaker 11:  out, you could only have one stream going on at once 'cause there's a tiny

1378
01:23:19,125 --> 01:23:23,005
Speaker 11:  little operating system or whatever. But like at

1379
01:23:23,005 --> 01:23:26,325
Speaker 11:  this point, you know, I, I like to, you know, listen to quiet little lo-fi

1380
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:30,325
Speaker 11:  beats a little little rain noises while I'm, while I'm doing stuff. And

1381
01:23:30,925 --> 01:23:34,005
Speaker 11:  I also kinda wanna listen to podcasts and I could do that on my PC really

1382
01:23:34,005 --> 01:23:37,285
Speaker 11:  easy. But like, can you even do that on iOS?

1383
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:41,685
Speaker 11:  Surely at this point you can do that on iOS somehow,

1384
01:23:42,095 --> 01:23:45,825
Speaker 11:  right? Anyway, big, big fan. Have a great day. Bye.

1385
01:23:46,485 --> 01:23:50,335
Speaker 1:  Okay, this sent me down a very fun rabbit hole because actually this is

1386
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:54,295
Speaker 1:  a thing I have wondered a lot about too, not because I want to do

1387
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:57,655
Speaker 1:  the two audio sources thing at the same time, but because Apple

1388
01:23:58,085 --> 01:24:01,815
Speaker 1:  handles this terribly, like there are

1389
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:05,615
Speaker 1:  the sources you want to have audio from, right? There's

1390
01:24:06,175 --> 01:24:08,695
Speaker 1:  whatever you use to listen to music, whatever you use to listen to podcasts.

1391
01:24:08,695 --> 01:24:11,975
Speaker 1:  For me that's Spotify and Pocket casts respectively. Then there's all the

1392
01:24:11,975 --> 01:24:15,335
Speaker 1:  streaming services which have, you know, audio and video. But then

1393
01:24:15,955 --> 01:24:19,935
Speaker 1:  you open a specific website or a certain app that is

1394
01:24:19,995 --> 01:24:23,575
Speaker 1:  not an audio first app and it just kind of

1395
01:24:23,745 --> 01:24:26,495
Speaker 1:  kills the audio that you're listening to. Like for me, the one that always

1396
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:30,375
Speaker 1:  does it is the ESPN app. For whatever reason, the e ESP n app, as soon

1397
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:34,215
Speaker 1:  as you open it before it even plays anything, just kind of takes

1398
01:24:34,245 --> 01:24:37,255
Speaker 1:  over the media player and says, actually, I am now the source of audio.

1399
01:24:38,605 --> 01:24:42,135
Speaker 1:  It's just terrible Software. Like this is poorly put together and poorly

1400
01:24:42,135 --> 01:24:45,735
Speaker 1:  written. And I think the thing that I have learned in doing research about

1401
01:24:45,735 --> 01:24:49,415
Speaker 1:  this and talking to folks about this is it is purely Apple's decision to

1402
01:24:49,415 --> 01:24:52,695
Speaker 1:  do it this way. There is nothing technically that prevents

1403
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:56,855
Speaker 1:  lots of audio sources all coming together on your phone. I kind of

1404
01:24:56,995 --> 01:25:00,855
Speaker 1:  get the idea. I think in general, most of the time you

1405
01:25:00,855 --> 01:25:04,295
Speaker 1:  only wanna be listening to one thing at a time. And like, you know that thing

1406
01:25:04,305 --> 01:25:08,135
Speaker 1:  where you have a background tab in your browser that just

1407
01:25:08,135 --> 01:25:10,935
Speaker 1:  starts playing audio out of nowhere and you can't figure out where it is

1408
01:25:10,935 --> 01:25:14,535
Speaker 1:  and it's super annoying. That kind of thing would be even worse

1409
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:18,535
Speaker 1:  on your phone because a, it might just start playing in the background while

1410
01:25:18,535 --> 01:25:21,535
Speaker 1:  your phone is locked, like it's in your pocket making noise and that sucks.

1411
01:25:22,225 --> 01:25:25,975
Speaker 1:  You'd have a much harder time finding where things are and where

1412
01:25:25,975 --> 01:25:29,855
Speaker 1:  they're playing audio because there aren't such good controls for that

1413
01:25:29,855 --> 01:25:33,815
Speaker 1:  stuff in the system. So there's not just like a where is playing audio screen

1414
01:25:33,935 --> 01:25:37,575
Speaker 1:  that you can go and open and do that. So I, I get the principle here,

1415
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:41,395
Speaker 1:  but I think Apple either needs to force its

1416
01:25:41,395 --> 01:25:45,115
Speaker 1:  developers to do this better or make it easier

1417
01:25:45,215 --> 01:25:48,115
Speaker 1:  for users to mess with. Because the other thing that'll happen is like if

1418
01:25:48,115 --> 01:25:52,035
Speaker 1:  you're listening to a podcast and then you open up

1419
01:25:52,255 --> 01:25:55,795
Speaker 1:  TikTok, TikTok will start playing and it will, you know,

1420
01:25:56,225 --> 01:26:00,035
Speaker 1:  drop the podcast audio out. But then If you pause TikTok, the podcast

1421
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:03,805
Speaker 1:  audio just comes back in a way that is very kind of chaotic and

1422
01:26:03,965 --> 01:26:07,805
Speaker 1:  I think is like bad ui. So these things are just poorly handled and to some

1423
01:26:07,805 --> 01:26:10,845
Speaker 1:  extent I'm almost like, just give me a thing that is like, here is all the

1424
01:26:10,845 --> 01:26:13,725
Speaker 1:  audio playing. You're in charge. Do whatever you want with the video of it.

1425
01:26:14,265 --> 01:26:18,245
Speaker 1:  You can actually do something like that on Android. If you use

1426
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:21,485
Speaker 1:  a Samsung phone, there's an app called Sound Assistant that actually gives

1427
01:26:21,745 --> 01:26:25,725
Speaker 1:  you some of that control over multiple sources of audio, where

1428
01:26:25,725 --> 01:26:29,445
Speaker 1:  it's coming from, where it's going and you can route everything a little

1429
01:26:29,445 --> 01:26:33,165
Speaker 1:  bit better. It's, it's hacky. And again, it's the kind of thing that you

1430
01:26:33,165 --> 01:26:36,325
Speaker 1:  don't need most of the time. Most of the time you just wanna be listening

1431
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:39,365
Speaker 1:  to one thing. I think that is a reasonable assumption for all of these companies

1432
01:26:39,365 --> 01:26:42,565
Speaker 1:  to make, but they should give you more controls. And also,

1433
01:26:43,835 --> 01:26:47,355
Speaker 1:  I know how Apple should fix this. It's so simple to me. There should be

1434
01:26:47,815 --> 01:26:51,515
Speaker 1:  an app on every Apple device that is called now playing.

1435
01:26:51,615 --> 01:26:54,755
Speaker 1:  If you've ever used CarPlay, you, you've seen the thing called now playing.

1436
01:26:54,755 --> 01:26:58,355
Speaker 1:  It's, it's the triangle play icon. It's with lines, it is the it, it

1437
01:26:58,955 --> 01:27:01,875
Speaker 1:  whatever is playing. It shows up in now playing and you tap on that thing

1438
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:04,475
Speaker 1:  and it shows you the audio that's playing and you can play it or pause it,

1439
01:27:04,755 --> 01:27:08,315
Speaker 1:  whatever. That should be an app that exists on your phone and it should be

1440
01:27:08,415 --> 01:27:11,795
Speaker 1:  all of the audio sources available to you at any given time, right? So like

1441
01:27:12,155 --> 01:27:15,955
Speaker 1:  I think about it sort of like clipboard history where it just saves

1442
01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:18,475
Speaker 1:  all the stuff you've copied and then you can go back through and be like,

1443
01:27:18,475 --> 01:27:21,595
Speaker 1:  oh, paste that one now and paste that one now. But instead it would be audio

1444
01:27:21,595 --> 01:27:25,115
Speaker 1:  history. It's like, oh, okay, you were watching and listening to

1445
01:27:25,855 --> 01:27:29,755
Speaker 1:  30 Rock. Would you like to have the audio of that playing in

1446
01:27:29,755 --> 01:27:33,475
Speaker 1:  the background while you're doing something else? Or, you know, play your

1447
01:27:33,475 --> 01:27:37,075
Speaker 1:  podcast while you're looking at some media

1448
01:27:37,095 --> 01:27:40,555
Speaker 1:  player, but I actually just wanna see the video on mute and keep listening

1449
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:44,035
Speaker 1:  to my podcast. This is a thing people should be able to choose. And I think

1450
01:27:44,415 --> 01:27:48,235
Speaker 1:  we, we live in a world now where actually so much video and

1451
01:27:48,235 --> 01:27:52,115
Speaker 1:  audio is now foregrounded in all of these apps that

1452
01:27:52,195 --> 01:27:56,115
Speaker 1:  I think this idea that actually you only wanna listen to one thing and

1453
01:27:56,115 --> 01:27:59,155
Speaker 1:  that thing is probably also the thing that you're looking at is just not

1454
01:27:59,155 --> 01:28:02,865
Speaker 1:  correct. So I I what, what I've come to

1455
01:28:02,865 --> 01:28:06,785
Speaker 1:  after doing a lot of research on this is that Apple picked a reasonable way

1456
01:28:06,785 --> 01:28:10,665
Speaker 1:  to do this. To say you're only gonna get one audio source at a time

1457
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:13,905
Speaker 1:  and it is going to be sort of the last audio source that you encountered

1458
01:28:14,435 --> 01:28:15,465
Speaker 1:  Reasonable assumption

1459
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:20,345
Speaker 1:  17 years ago. I think it's the wrong assumption now. And I think

1460
01:28:21,325 --> 01:28:24,825
Speaker 1:  one interesting thing that needs to happen on a lot of these devices is they're

1461
01:28:24,825 --> 01:28:28,705
Speaker 1:  gonna have to get much smarter about inputs and outputs. I mean, especially

1462
01:28:28,705 --> 01:28:32,625
Speaker 1:  you think about something like smart glasses. If, if they can't

1463
01:28:32,775 --> 01:28:36,625
Speaker 1:  dynamically and intelligently figure out what you wanna be listening to

1464
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:40,145
Speaker 1:  at any given time, they're gonna fall apart. That's the kind of thing that

1465
01:28:40,145 --> 01:28:44,105
Speaker 1:  you can't do easily yourself. And if it's

1466
01:28:44,225 --> 01:28:48,145
Speaker 1:  choosing for you and it's picking the wrong thing at the wrong time,

1467
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:52,815
Speaker 1:  that's gonna be a bad experience. So I think the way that these systems handle

1468
01:28:52,825 --> 01:28:56,695
Speaker 1:  audio is actually going to get more important and more complicated

1469
01:28:56,695 --> 01:29:00,655
Speaker 1:  over time. And the answer I am increasingly convinced is

1470
01:29:00,655 --> 01:29:04,445
Speaker 1:  just to give us a little tiny bit of chaos. If I wanna listen to music and

1471
01:29:04,525 --> 01:29:08,325
Speaker 1:  a podcast and a show at the same time, I believe that I should be able to,

1472
01:29:08,485 --> 01:29:12,185
Speaker 1:  I don't think that I should, I think that's kind of bonkers, but I think

1473
01:29:12,225 --> 01:29:15,985
Speaker 1:  I should be able to, and that is my official stance. Give me a now

1474
01:29:15,985 --> 01:29:19,665
Speaker 1:  playing app that just shows me all of the audio from everywhere on my phone

1475
01:29:20,045 --> 01:29:23,105
Speaker 1:  and let me figure it out except for browser tabs, because if we get to the

1476
01:29:23,105 --> 01:29:26,345
Speaker 1:  point where things get to do the like lazy loading audio that starts playing

1477
01:29:26,345 --> 01:29:29,905
Speaker 1:  five minutes after you load a browser tab, that's a nightmare. So

1478
01:29:30,215 --> 01:29:34,205
Speaker 1:  none of that in the browser. Let my, let my apps do some weird stuff.

1479
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:37,565
Speaker 1:  Well, I'll figure it out. Anyway, that is it for The Vergecast today, by

1480
01:29:37,565 --> 01:29:40,605
Speaker 1:  the way. If you have tips on how to make the audio stuff make more sense

1481
01:29:41,035 --> 01:29:45,005
Speaker 1:  both on Android and on an iPhone, I am all ears. I know there's

1482
01:29:45,045 --> 01:29:48,965
Speaker 1:  a way you can jailbreak an iPhone and get more

1483
01:29:48,965 --> 01:29:51,525
Speaker 1:  control over the audio sources. That's actually one way. I know the phones

1484
01:29:51,525 --> 01:29:55,465
Speaker 1:  are capable of doing it in theory, but I don't think most people wanna jailbreak

1485
01:29:55,465 --> 01:29:58,505
Speaker 1:  their phone. But If you figured out some clever hack for how to manage all

1486
01:29:58,505 --> 01:30:02,425
Speaker 1:  the audio on your phone, let me know. I'm all ears. 8 6 6 VERGE one, one

1487
01:30:02,745 --> 01:30:06,105
Speaker 1:  Vergecast at diverse.com. Thank you to everybody who came on the show and

1488
01:30:06,105 --> 01:30:08,905
Speaker 1:  thank you as always for listening. Like I said, we're gonna talk a bunch

1489
01:30:08,935 --> 01:30:12,665
Speaker 1:  more about the world in TikTok Bands and politics and Inaugurations on

1490
01:30:12,665 --> 01:30:16,385
Speaker 1:  Friday show. And then honestly, it is my sincere hope

1491
01:30:16,935 --> 01:30:20,265
Speaker 1:  that we are not going to have to keep doing that. I think we are, we are

1492
01:30:20,265 --> 01:30:24,025
Speaker 1:  in a very political moment full of a lot of change and a lot of

1493
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:28,025
Speaker 1:  new ways that the tech industry is going to exist, particularly in the United States.

1494
01:30:28,485 --> 01:30:30,905
Speaker 1:  And we're gonna talk about it in the ways that it makes sense. But I think

1495
01:30:31,275 --> 01:30:35,105
Speaker 1:  we're gonna try not to make this a podcast about politics because

1496
01:30:35,105 --> 01:30:36,785
Speaker 1:  we don't want that and I know you don't either.

1497
01:30:38,605 --> 01:30:42,185
Speaker 1:  Anyway, there's lots more on everything we covered here@thebir.com. I'll

1498
01:30:42,185 --> 01:30:45,825
Speaker 1:  link to Kevin's GQ story that I really liked. I'll link to a bunch of Jacobs

1499
01:30:45,825 --> 01:30:49,585
Speaker 1:  reporting. I'll link to our reporting on venue. All of it in the

1500
01:30:49,585 --> 01:30:53,265
Speaker 1:  show notes on the website, keep it locked. News is nuts.

1501
01:30:53,645 --> 01:30:57,305
Speaker 1:  And as always, If you have thoughts, questions, feelings, or again audio

1507
01:31:13,925 --> 01:31:17,745
Speaker 1:  the TikTok ban, more AI news. There's a Samsung event

1508
01:31:17,745 --> 01:31:20,665
Speaker 1:  this week. Then we're gonna get to talk about gadgets, which I'm very excited
