Description: Nilay and David talk about the election, and how The Vergecast plans to cover and talk about the next four years of the Trump administration. But only for a minute. Then it's onto our reviews of the new Mac Mini and MacBook Pro, which reset Apple's desktop and laptop lineup in an excellent way. After that, Sean Hollister joins the show to discuss his review of the PlayStation 5 Pro, the news about backwards compatibility for the Nintendo Switch successor, and the state of Nintendo's fight against emulators. In the lightning round, we talk about really expensive domain names, oddly named smart home standards, and cloud gaming whales. Which apparently exist.

2
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:49,285
Speaker 3:  Hello and welcome to our cast. The flagship podcast is spending millions

3
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:53,205
Speaker 3:  of dollars on domain names. It's, it's cut. We're gonna talk about,

4
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:56,205
Speaker 3:  it's a real thing that happened. It happens every day. You know, you just

5
00:00:56,205 --> 00:01:00,125
Speaker 3:  dunno about it. And that's why this podcast is hard pivoting away from

6
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:04,005
Speaker 3:  politics towards the buying and selling of domain names. I'm your

7
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:05,525
Speaker 3:  friend Neli David Pierce is here.

8
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:08,805
Speaker 4:  Hello. You know what I love about that is I, I genuinely think we have some

9
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:12,845
Speaker 4:  real serious competition to be the flagship podcast of the domain buying

10
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,485
Speaker 4:  industry. And this is why I love technology.

11
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,725
Speaker 3:  But you know, they got real estate podcasts out there.

12
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:18,565
Speaker 4:  That's what I'm saying.

13
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:22,365
Speaker 3:  We we could we cyber state, is that a word?

14
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:26,205
Speaker 4:  I wrote a big story a few years ago about like the ongoing

15
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:30,445
Speaker 4:  primacy of the.com and got to interview

16
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:33,365
Speaker 4:  some truly fascinating characters. People who just like

17
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:38,005
Speaker 4:  bought a bunch of TLDs and just like screwed off to the

18
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,925
Speaker 4:  Caribbean and now make millions of dollars selling domain names. It's

19
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:42,205
Speaker 4:  the greatest.

20
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:46,405
Speaker 3:  There's we one, we should do this. We should just pivot to this. Yes. So

21
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:48,845
Speaker 3:  If, you want to front our domain arbitrage business,

22
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:54,285
Speaker 3:  you know, that's a lightning round sponsorship opportunity. Two, we

23
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:56,605
Speaker 3:  are gonna talk about a specific domain name later, which is very interesting.

24
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,165
Speaker 3:  And three, the entire.io

25
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:04,325
Speaker 3:  TLD is like vanishing. Yeah. Which is like a big story

26
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,165
Speaker 3:  because a bunch of crypto and AI startups have.io names.

27
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:09,445
Speaker 3:  We'll come back to that as well.

28
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,245
Speaker 4:  Do you own any silly domains?

29
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:16,005
Speaker 3:  You know, I went through a period where I, I had a hover account. Yeah. And

30
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:17,645
Speaker 3:  that was my form of sports betting

31
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:22,565
Speaker 3:  and now all those, oh the, the credit cards expired and the domain names

32
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:24,775
Speaker 3:  went away and so it goes,

33
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:29,095
Speaker 4:  Yeah, there was a period I would say, of maybe three or four years where

34
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:32,735
Speaker 4:  every couple of months I would get an email from hover being like, your

35
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:35,975
Speaker 4:  domain name is about to renew. Do you wanna renew it? And it would be straight

36
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:39,935
Speaker 4:  up for a domain. I had completely forgotten that I owned. So that's all

37
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:43,375
Speaker 4:  I had. I had a phase, I would say it was like a, it was like a shopping phase

38
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:47,295
Speaker 4:  and I bought a bunch of domains and now they are slowly winnowing

39
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:50,855
Speaker 4:  away but I still own a bunch of them. I bought a domain for

40
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:55,055
Speaker 4:  Anna to write her like a thing for her birthday one year. It was one of

41
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,775
Speaker 4:  the coolest thing I ever did. So she just has her own website that is just

42
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:59,565
Speaker 4:  like a love letter. I wrote to my wife one time.

43
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:00,845
Speaker 3:  Aw, that's very sweet.

44
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:03,725
Speaker 4:  Coolest thing I ever did. And now I paid 10 bucks a year and I guarantee

45
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,045
Speaker 4:  you she hasn't looked at it in five years just wasting money. Now

46
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:08,925
Speaker 3:  You gotta bring it up like every anniversary. Yeah, exactly. Do you know

47
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:12,725
Speaker 3:  how as you get older you realize like the deep lore of your friends is just

48
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,525
Speaker 3:  that you were jerks like If, you like look at it with fresh eyes. You're

49
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:19,365
Speaker 3:  like we were just pretty mean to each other. We, I had a friend.

50
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,525
Speaker 4:  That's how men interact. That's what we

51
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:23,965
Speaker 3:  Do. Pretty much. I had a friend, they dated as a person,

52
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:28,605
Speaker 3:  this person not very bright and thought the word debacle was debacle.

53
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:31,605
Speaker 3:  And I owned debacle.com for a long time

54
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:36,565
Speaker 3:  and I couldn't make it a thing because ultimately the core of it

55
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,835
Speaker 3:  was just being mean to someone. You can be like, I got this great story about

56
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,955
Speaker 3:  debacle and you're like, no, you're just a jerk.

57
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:47,715
Speaker 4:  I think we're past the statute of limitations on it though. It's time to,

58
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:49,035
Speaker 4:  it's time to really turn that

59
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:52,075
Speaker 3:  Everyone, everyone is like long since married. Yeah, but I'm just saying

60
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:56,035
Speaker 3:  I'm just prefer I'm, I'm putting around that story, the self-awareness.

61
00:03:56,425 --> 00:04:00,315
Speaker 3:  Yeah that was just the heart of your friend's lore sometimes is

62
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:03,275
Speaker 3:  like, oh you are super rude when you were 25 years old.

63
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:07,195
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That's how it goes. Alright. Right. We got a lot talk about there's

64
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:10,715
Speaker 3:  new Mac minis, there's PS five pros, there's

65
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:14,675
Speaker 3:  upgrades to the matter standards. I got a lightning round and we on sponsored.

66
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,275
Speaker 3:  We should start with the obvious news in America

67
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:23,465
Speaker 3:  today, which is that I think I know when the Jeep Wagoner

68
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:23,985
Speaker 3:  ass is coming.

69
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:28,785
Speaker 4:  That's exactly where I thought you were going. This is good. I'm glad we're

70
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:29,625
Speaker 4:  on the same page here today.

71
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:34,265
Speaker 3:  I've, I've gotten wind that it's December. So If you're in the market for

72
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:38,345
Speaker 3:  Jeep's first ev it may or may not be December. No it's obviously the election.

73
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,065
Speaker 3:  It happened on Tuesday. It's a big deal. Donald Trump won. Again If you haven't

74
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:45,785
Speaker 3:  heard, we're not gonna dwell on it too much. We didn't dwell on the fact

75
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,465
Speaker 3:  that I wrote an endorsement of Harris last week. We try to keep

76
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,465
Speaker 3:  politics off of this show. I have a whole other show to ran

77
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:56,425
Speaker 3:  to my politics. So we can do that over there. I will say, you know, we have

78
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:59,225
Speaker 3:  a big audience. I'm sure some people are very happy. I know a lot of our

79
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:03,385
Speaker 3:  audience is very upset. We're gonna cover Trump the same way we

80
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:06,185
Speaker 3:  covered him the first time, which is he's gonna make a bunch of decisions.

81
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:10,785
Speaker 3:  A lot of them will be tech policy decisions and this time around we

82
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:14,345
Speaker 3:  have a bunch of familiarity with how he approaches tech policy

83
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:18,625
Speaker 3:  and so do the big companies, right? The big companies, their CEOs are all

84
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,465
Speaker 3:  writing him congratulatory notes. Jeff Bezos is like, throw

85
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:26,185
Speaker 3:  me a blue origin contract. Tim Cook probably doesn't want

86
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,785
Speaker 3:  20% tariffs on the iPhone. Right? Elon Musk

87
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:32,945
Speaker 3:  wants side loading to happen on the iPhone. This is a thing that he has said

88
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:36,105
Speaker 3:  that the app store review process is censorship.

89
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:40,425
Speaker 3:  This is a lot of competing tech billionaire stuff in a very

90
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:43,105
Speaker 3:  transactional way with a character they're familiar with. And it's gonna

91
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:45,705
Speaker 3:  lead us to covering a lot of stories. Just the tariffs alone.

92
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:49,615
Speaker 3:  Most of our products are not made in the United States. Right. The idea that

93
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,575
Speaker 3:  we can instantly impose tariffs and have that manufacturing move here

94
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:55,445
Speaker 3:  seems farfetched.

95
00:05:57,095 --> 00:06:00,875
Speaker 3:  If you'll recall the last time this man tried to move technology manufacturing

96
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:04,795
Speaker 3:  to the United States of America, we spent a lot of time pointing out buildings

97
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:07,835
Speaker 3:  in Wisconsin were empty some familiarity.

98
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:10,195
Speaker 4:  How many weeks do you think it's been at this point since

99
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:13,355
Speaker 3:  Google announced a website for the track? One of the first things happened

100
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:17,155
Speaker 3:  in Trump won was Congress immediately repealed a rule

101
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:21,035
Speaker 3:  that imposed privacy regulations on ISPs. And then we made a

102
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:24,795
Speaker 3:  character If, you will recall out of a Jeep Pi I I know who the new character

103
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:27,635
Speaker 3:  it's gonna be. It's gonna be Brendan Carr. He, he wants to be the head of

104
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:31,515
Speaker 3:  the FCC. It's every like in all likelihood he will be, we wrote a

105
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:35,475
Speaker 3:  profile of him in the 2020 election 'cause he very much was advocating for

106
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,355
Speaker 3:  the FCC to be in charge of section two 30, which kind of makes no sense.

107
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,155
Speaker 3:  It's all gonna happen again, right? So we're gonna just cover

108
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:46,155
Speaker 3:  the world as it stands and the people and the characters are doing stuff

109
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:50,005
Speaker 3:  in that world. Sometimes that will I think cross over to the show. Yeah.

110
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:54,005
Speaker 3:  Many times. I I care a lot about broadband deployment. I

111
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,565
Speaker 3:  I know our audience does too. We talk about the FCCA lot on this show. It's,

112
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:01,565
Speaker 3:  it's all just gonna happen again and we'll bring it up on the show as it's

113
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:05,325
Speaker 3:  relevant. But I don't think we're gonna make this a show about Donald

114
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,125
Speaker 3:  Trump's tweets. Does that make any sense? No.

115
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I think, I mean you mentioned kind of what we've learned versus the

116
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:14,125
Speaker 4:  last time we did this and I think one big change is

117
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:18,125
Speaker 4:  we're just clearer on what's real and what isn't. And I think this is true

118
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:22,045
Speaker 4:  of any political situation that like the, the question of

119
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:25,965
Speaker 4:  what someone says and what is real are very rarely the same thing. And

120
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:30,325
Speaker 4:  I would say it's just that the volume with Trump is so much higher.

121
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:34,925
Speaker 4:  And so we've, we've learned in in ways how to sort of suss

122
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:38,645
Speaker 4:  out what matters and what doesn't. But I think like it or not, like

123
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:42,965
Speaker 4:  I chose not to become a political reporter on purpose and yet we are at a,

124
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:46,685
Speaker 4:  at a moment in time where like I think you could argue that tech

125
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:50,405
Speaker 4:  companies and in particular a handful of big tech companies are going to

126
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:53,805
Speaker 4:  be more central both to the

127
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:57,845
Speaker 4:  running of the government itself but also like what

128
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:01,765
Speaker 4:  the, that government is interested in than ever. And I mean

129
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:05,245
Speaker 4:  you look at what Elon Musk has been in the Trump campaign already. Like these

130
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:08,645
Speaker 4:  things are intermingled in ways they've never been before.

131
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:12,925
Speaker 4:  And I think part of what we're gonna have to do is both figure out

132
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,765
Speaker 4:  what all of that means and try to cover the ramifications

133
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:19,845
Speaker 4:  for regular people, right? Because it all, so much of it is

134
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:24,125
Speaker 4:  yelling and political nonsense and like I think we don't,

135
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:27,325
Speaker 4:  this show in particular, we try really hard not to care about that.

136
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:32,165
Speaker 4:  But like this stuff is going to matter in every other thing that

137
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:36,005
Speaker 4:  we cover in new ways and I think we have to figure that

138
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:36,205
Speaker 4:  out.

139
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:39,765
Speaker 3:  I'll just keep giving examples 'cause I think that's a useful way to talk

140
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:43,005
Speaker 3:  about it. The Google antitrust case where they're paying Apple to be the

141
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:46,765
Speaker 3:  default. That's case started in the first Trump administration, right? It

142
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:50,685
Speaker 3:  got finished in the Biden administration. I'm sure Apple wants the new Trump

143
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:54,725
Speaker 3:  DOJ to drop the antitrust case against them. But I am equally sure

144
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:58,645
Speaker 3:  that Andreessen Horowitz, which promotes what it calls the little tech agenda

145
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:02,485
Speaker 3:  and which spent a bunch of money on Donald Trump wants that case to be

146
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:06,125
Speaker 3:  pursued to the finish line 'cause they would love to side load crypto apps

147
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:10,085
Speaker 3:  onto the iPhone. There's just a lot there. I have no

148
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:13,965
Speaker 3:  idea how it's going to shake out, but just to bring

149
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:17,925
Speaker 3:  it all back around, the fact that there is this week a p os emulator

150
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:21,605
Speaker 3:  on the iPhone is the result of government action. Yeah. Like

151
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:25,325
Speaker 3:  there's just a lot of stuff that is true about the products we use and how

152
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:28,245
Speaker 3:  they work and how they work together that is related to what happens over

153
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:31,805
Speaker 3:  there. and we just have, keep an eye on it because all of these people are

154
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,125
Speaker 3:  gonna start kind of nakedly lobbying the Trump administration

155
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:39,245
Speaker 3:  and their interests aren't actually aligned. So there's just a lot of sort

156
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,245
Speaker 3:  of inherent conflict which will result in stories and then I think

157
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,525
Speaker 3:  ultimately result in changes to the products that we all use that we like

158
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,085
Speaker 3:  to talk about in the show. Yep. There's a whole bunch of other stuff and

159
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:51,285
Speaker 3:  we will bring it up when it's necessary. I'm eager to hear from everyone.

160
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:54,845
Speaker 3:  We have all gone through this together before. Yeah. Like If, you want me

161
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:58,805
Speaker 3:  to just start roasting foxcon every day? Like I, I can deliver, I just

162
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:02,165
Speaker 3:  don't want to scream into the void for four years. So let us know. We got

163
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:04,845
Speaker 3:  email addresses, we got voicemail lines. We want to yell at me personally.

164
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:08,805
Speaker 3:  I'll, I'll take it. We are here to serve the audience but

165
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:11,245
Speaker 3:  we're gonna, we're gonna try to figure this one out and make sure we are

166
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:15,305
Speaker 3:  constructive as opposed to just being noisy. If that makes any

167
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:15,465
Speaker 3:  sense.

168
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:15,825
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

169
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:19,485
Speaker 3:  Alright. Hard pivot away from presidential politics.

170
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:23,885
Speaker 3:  Let's talk about some tiny computers. Tiny computers. Speaking of

171
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:27,205
Speaker 3:  20% tariffs, the Mac Mini now cost $5,000

172
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:31,915
Speaker 3:  but it's made by hand in your bedroom.

173
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:37,685
Speaker 3:  That joke has layers. I'm just putting an After that joke has layers.

174
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:41,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah, there's somewhere in North Carolina I think

175
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,645
Speaker 4:  there either is or is not a factory.

176
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:47,725
Speaker 3:  Mark Robinson has been sentenced to manufacturing the, the Mac

177
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,245
Speaker 3:  Mini in your bed.

178
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:54,425
Speaker 3:  All right. All the Macs came out last week. They were announced last week.

179
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:58,945
Speaker 3:  We have reviews the M four Mac mini, the MacBook Pro 14, we

180
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:02,505
Speaker 3:  have the baseball review and Tony is reviewing the high-end model. Let's

181
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:06,305
Speaker 3:  start with the Mac mini. Chris Welch reviewed it, he's in love. I,

182
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:09,785
Speaker 3:  as I was reading his review, I had to stop myself from buying a computer.

183
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:10,305
Speaker 3:  I don't need

184
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:15,025
Speaker 4:  Same, I I haven't fully stopped myself yet. I still

185
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:18,705
Speaker 4:  have it in my cart but I'm not looking at the tab anymore. So I'm considering

186
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:22,585
Speaker 4:  that a victory. But I would say by the time you're

187
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:26,465
Speaker 4:  listening to this, there is like an over 90% chance that I have

188
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:30,105
Speaker 4:  bought this Mac mini. I mean they did it. It is the thing, right? It is,

189
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:33,545
Speaker 4:  it is what we hoped it would be. And I think

190
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:37,425
Speaker 4:  the, the one thing I've been surprised by actually is

191
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:41,905
Speaker 4:  how much smaller it actually is And, and it seems to like

192
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:47,105
Speaker 4:  be meaningfully different in terms of like where you can put it and how it

193
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:51,025
Speaker 4:  fits on your desk and like the little places you can stash it and for

194
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:54,445
Speaker 4:  something like this, which is a designed to be a computer you mostly never

195
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:58,165
Speaker 4:  like touch or look at or interact with. That does matter, right?

196
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:02,125
Speaker 4:  I think I still don't know that that is like the most important thing in

197
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,405
Speaker 4:  the universe. I don't think you should upgrade just to get a slightly smaller

198
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:05,085
Speaker 4:  Mac mini.

199
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:10,655
Speaker 4:  But also everything else about it is good. The performance is right.

200
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:14,655
Speaker 4:  It has a lot of io. I've heard a couple of people say they wish the front

201
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:18,615
Speaker 4:  ports were thunderbolt instead of just regular USBC. The back ones are thunderbolt

202
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:24,015
Speaker 4:  but fine. Like this thing is $600. And I think in, in

203
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:27,575
Speaker 4:  a time when Apple products are are getting, I would say a

204
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:33,215
Speaker 4:  more expensive at dubious additional value, this one

205
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:35,615
Speaker 4:  is like a, just an unabashed victory.

206
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,855
Speaker 3:  I think Chris's line is this is easily the best value in the entire MAC lineup.

207
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:40,295
Speaker 3:  Now I think

208
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:40,815
Speaker 4:  That's probably true

209
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:44,615
Speaker 3:  And the thing that really cements it for me is the base model. The $600 one

210
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:48,415
Speaker 3:  has 16 gigs of ram, which has kept me from buying

211
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:51,935
Speaker 3:  a Mac for quite some time, right? Mm. You go, I go into the configurator,

212
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:55,895
Speaker 3:  I look at eight gigs of RAM in the default I go add the RAM to get to 16

213
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:59,335
Speaker 3:  gigs. And then I'm always like, this is so expensive. This is the most expensive

214
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:02,335
Speaker 3:  ram in history. I'm not buying this dumb computer. Right? And I just have

215
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,055
Speaker 4:  It. Which is still true by the way. Every, every one of the upgrades on all

216
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:09,855
Speaker 4:  of these new MacBooks and is like lunacy.

217
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,415
Speaker 4:  It's like I, I know what these things cost and you're trying to charge me

218
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,415
Speaker 4:  200 bucks for a little more storage. Like

219
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,935
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah you have it. Chris has it in the review. You can buy two base model

220
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:22,295
Speaker 3:  MAC minis for a dollar less than,

221
00:13:22,295 --> 00:13:23,015
Speaker 4:  Than the upgraded

222
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:23,815
Speaker 3:  One. Than the upgraded

223
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:24,695
Speaker 4:  One. That's so stupid.

224
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:30,855
Speaker 3:  Yes. You can buy two base model MAC minis with 16 gigs of

225
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:34,815
Speaker 3:  RAM and 256 gig SSDs for the price that

226
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:38,495
Speaker 3:  costs to upgrade a single Mac mini to 32 gigs of RAM and 512

227
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,615
Speaker 3:  gigs of storage. It's actually a dollar less.

228
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:44,855
Speaker 4:  That's just, that's stupid. But again, to your point, the good

229
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:48,495
Speaker 4:  news is, and I think this is true of both the MAC Mini and the new

230
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:52,415
Speaker 4:  MacBook Pro, which we should also talk about is that the base model is excellent

231
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:56,495
Speaker 4:  and I think Apple, apple for years has given you base models

232
00:13:56,495 --> 00:14:00,295
Speaker 4:  that are like almost there. But that you, you always kind of want

233
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:04,135
Speaker 4:  one step up from the base model. Yeah. Of almost every Apple product. The

234
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:07,535
Speaker 4:  thing they try to sell you is the one level up. Either it was like the iPad

235
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:11,415
Speaker 4:  that only had 64 gigs of storage or this one that had eight gigs of ram,

236
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:14,935
Speaker 4:  which is a perfectly fine amount of ram. No super wrong. It's not what so

237
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:15,375
Speaker 4:  like how

238
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,295
Speaker 3:  Will you unleash the power of Apple intelligence with only eight gigs of

239
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:18,495
Speaker 3:  ram

240
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:22,235
Speaker 3:  my friend?

241
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:26,555
Speaker 4:  Very few things have made me feel more vindicated than everybody getting

242
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:30,435
Speaker 4:  access to Apple Intelligence. But, but this time

243
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:35,195
Speaker 4:  these are the right models for most people. The base model is

244
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:37,795
Speaker 4:  the one that most people should buy and I think that's very much to Apple's

245
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,995
Speaker 4:  credit that like it, it just built the computer people should have and If,

246
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:44,635
Speaker 4:  you just click buy and don't check any other boxes. You're going to get an

247
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:45,275
Speaker 4:  excellent computer.

248
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,875
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And what's also great is a bunch of the outgoing computers, like the

249
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:52,725
Speaker 3:  M two errors and M three errors are being sold now in

250
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,565
Speaker 3:  16 gig base configurations for the same price. Which again I think

251
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:59,685
Speaker 3:  is because Apple just wants you to use Apple intelligence but is also proof

252
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:03,045
Speaker 3:  that that extra eight gigs of RAM did never cost them anything. Right.

253
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,925
Speaker 4:  But it is, I I actually think, I mean we for a couple of years

254
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:12,125
Speaker 4:  I think had a long debate about when the M1

255
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,725
Speaker 4:  came out, right? The M1 MacBook Air and it was like an obvious giant

256
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:18,845
Speaker 4:  upgrade from the previous ones and then the M two came out and we were kind

257
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:22,805
Speaker 4:  of like, well maybe the better buy is actually the M1 air

258
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:26,405
Speaker 4:  which is getting cheaper because the M two is out and and the performance

259
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:30,485
Speaker 4:  increase isn't necessarily there. And I think that question

260
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:33,845
Speaker 4:  might be complicated, right? Like is the, is the increase from the

261
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:38,285
Speaker 4:  M two or the M three to the M four super meaningful? I think the

262
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:41,925
Speaker 4:  increase from eight gigs to 16 is meaningful. Yeah. Again, eight gigs is

263
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:43,125
Speaker 4:  fine for most people. That's

264
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:48,045
Speaker 3:  Super. Isn't the argument by the way. I know, just to lay it out, I'm aware

265
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:51,565
Speaker 3:  of the argument that David is too embarrassed to make that some of you'll

266
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:55,205
Speaker 3:  put in the YouTube comments but the disc is so fast that going to swap

267
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,405
Speaker 3:  doesn't really matter. If you have eight gigs of ram. I I know, I know. I'm

268
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,965
Speaker 3:  aware of the argument. Apple executives have looked me in the eye and made

269
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:05,245
Speaker 3:  the argument and I'm just telling you that it's still not good.

270
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:09,565
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. I'm sitting here on an M1 Mac mini with eight gigs of ram and I

271
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:12,725
Speaker 4:  can tell you that that argument is not true. And yet eight gigs of RAM is

272
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:16,485
Speaker 4:  basically fine. Just close some tabs, you'll be fine. But

273
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:20,065
Speaker 4:  anyway, going to 16 as the base is, is

274
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:23,745
Speaker 4:  really important. And I actually am, am like eager to now go get my hands

275
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:27,625
Speaker 4:  on one of the M twos with 16 gigs a couple of years in and

276
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:30,865
Speaker 4:  see, 'cause we're gonna end up with like, you know, there's the, the Walmart

277
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:34,625
Speaker 4:  version of it that is deliberately, substantially cheaper and kind of the,

278
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:38,545
Speaker 4:  the like entry level MacBook Air, when that thing has like an M two and

279
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:42,345
Speaker 4:  16 gigs of ram that is going to be a very, very compelling computer

280
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:46,745
Speaker 4:  for a lot of people. And I just think like again, If, you want one

281
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:50,185
Speaker 4:  of these beastly machines that's gonna last you forever. Like I feel very

282
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:53,385
Speaker 4:  good about both the air or about both the new pro and the new mini,

283
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:58,465
Speaker 4:  but especially as we get to this 16 gig of RAM baseline, even

284
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:02,225
Speaker 4:  a couple of generations old is gonna start to last a really, really long

285
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:02,425
Speaker 4:  time.

286
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:06,585
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I am, well first of all, the M1

287
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:09,705
Speaker 3:  air, the Walmart special M1 air is now down to 6 49

288
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:14,455
Speaker 3:  and it still says built for Apple Intelligence and I just have to, for as

289
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:17,855
Speaker 3:  little as Apple Intelligence does, it's not gonna go great on that computer.

290
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:18,415
Speaker 3:  No,

291
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:22,935
Speaker 4:  I would not buy that If you want an AI machine but given a minute and that

292
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:26,895
Speaker 4:  thing will be $649 and it will be an M two and it will have 16 gigs of

293
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:29,695
Speaker 4:  ram, right? Yeah. Like when we get to there, that gets really exciting.

294
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:34,255
Speaker 3:  Becky has an Intel MacBook Care like a rose gold one and it

295
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:37,975
Speaker 3:  is dying and I told her today to buy an M three

296
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:41,455
Speaker 3:  air 16 gigs of RAM for just about a thousand dollars. I think it's a little

297
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:43,895
Speaker 3:  over a thousand dollars. Like this is the best buy in computing right now.

298
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:44,895
Speaker 4:  I think that's right.

299
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:48,935
Speaker 3:  You don't need an M four for the stuff we're doing. No. And this

300
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:52,765
Speaker 3:  computer is gonna last forever with 16 gigs of Ram So I. It's true that of

301
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,765
Speaker 3:  in the sort of MacBook Air zone picking the chip is sort of not as

302
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,845
Speaker 3:  important as the ram and that the fact that 16 gigs is becoming more prevalent

303
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,205
Speaker 3:  in all of their spots is really good. Yeah. For the Mac Mini

304
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:07,045
Speaker 3:  this is like, you just push the button. You don't need like, and this is

305
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,485
Speaker 3:  why I've been so close to buying one all day. 'cause they've reduced the

306
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:13,325
Speaker 3:  pain of like going into the configurator and adding more money to the base

307
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,245
Speaker 3:  price. Right. Genius. It also is proof that that X-ray gigs of RAM cost

308
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:17,605
Speaker 3:  him nothing.

309
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:22,165
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. That was always just pure naked money grubbing

310
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:26,045
Speaker 4:  from Apple. The, the one financial question

311
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,005
Speaker 4:  I am dealing with as I go through this is do I spend the extra $200 to get

312
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:33,925
Speaker 4:  the touch ID keyboard because I'm, I'm sitting here, I have

313
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:37,845
Speaker 4:  a Logitech keyboard that I really like. I have a, a Logitech mouse that

314
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:40,325
Speaker 4:  I really like that I will never give up because the Magic Mouse is an awful

315
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,525
Speaker 4:  piece of hardware that no one should use.

316
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:47,075
Speaker 4:  Touch ID is awesome and goes a very long way. And especially

317
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:50,555
Speaker 4:  if you're never gonna turn the thing off because the power button is on the

318
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:52,315
Speaker 4:  bottom, which did not bother Chris Welch at all.

319
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:57,225
Speaker 4:  It's like the touch ID thing with the Mac Mini goes a really long way.

320
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,625
Speaker 3:  Do you have an Apple watch?

321
00:18:59,305 --> 00:18:59,545
Speaker 4:  I do.

322
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,865
Speaker 3:  So I unlock my Mac with my Apple watch. I've never even thought about needing

323
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:03,745
Speaker 3:  to unlock it with Oh,

324
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:07,735
Speaker 4:  That's interesting. I have that set up with my phone, but I actually don't

325
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:08,815
Speaker 4:  think I have it set up with my Mac.

326
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:11,415
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I sit down at my am mac at home and I just like hit the button and

327
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:14,655
Speaker 3:  I unlock. It's great. Okay. Alright. That's gonna, I've I've never, unless

328
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,695
Speaker 3:  you wanna buy stuff on your Mac, but I don't, I don't use Safari in that

329
00:19:17,695 --> 00:19:17,855
Speaker 3:  way.

330
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:21,135
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no it's really, it's purely a login thing. Alright. Right. This is

331
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:24,015
Speaker 4:  good. You've solved this for me. I can keep my, I can keep my computer. Thank

332
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:24,655
Speaker 4:  you. Yeah,

333
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:28,975
Speaker 3:  We should talk about the MacBook Pro and it seems Antonio

334
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:32,855
Speaker 3:  reviewed this one for us. It does seem like Apple finally created some

335
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:36,695
Speaker 3:  differentiation for the base model MacBook Pro. They've added

336
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:39,695
Speaker 3:  the correct ports, it has more performance than the air. It's no longer this

337
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:43,295
Speaker 3:  weird tweener where it was like the base model pro is

338
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:47,015
Speaker 3:  just for people who don't wanna MacBook Air. Now it's like, oh, this is a

339
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:50,295
Speaker 3:  meaningfully good computer and then If, you want to go up from there? You

340
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:51,255
Speaker 3:  can continue to go up from there.

341
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:55,575
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Again, it's back, it's back to the thing of like Apple always wanted

342
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:58,695
Speaker 4:  you to buy one above the base. And I actually think that was even more true

343
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:03,135
Speaker 4:  on the pro than others, which like, weirdly, they

344
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,975
Speaker 4:  were caught in between the, the Base Pro had a touch bar for like way

345
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:10,535
Speaker 4:  too long. And finally it seems like they just sort of scrapped the whole

346
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:14,415
Speaker 4:  thing. and we like the, the pro line now makes sense in order all

347
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:18,215
Speaker 4:  the way up. And again, the, the base now starts at

348
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:22,255
Speaker 4:  I think 1599. Yeah. Clear upgrade from

349
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:26,135
Speaker 4:  the air in terms of price, but also in terms of like what you get performance

350
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:29,375
Speaker 4:  wise and all that stuff for battery life. Right Now you've been a pro guy

351
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:33,095
Speaker 4:  forever, right? Like I'm, I'm an air guy and to me this does not make me

352
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:35,535
Speaker 4:  wanna a pro anymore. And I suspect for you this is like, this is exactly

353
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:39,095
Speaker 4:  the pro that I'm looking for and I feel like good for Apple for mostly getting

354
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:39,495
Speaker 4:  that right?

355
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:43,535
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I think, I think that's correct. I I mean I, I have,

356
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:47,565
Speaker 3:  I'm a 15 inch I guess now it's 16 inch laptop person

357
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:51,645
Speaker 3:  and always have been. So again, you know, Becky needed a computer and I was

358
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:53,885
Speaker 3:  like, you should just get a new medical care. And it never crossed my mind

359
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:56,685
Speaker 3:  to say, oh, you should spend a little bit more money on the pro. Whereas

360
00:20:56,745 --> 00:21:00,365
Speaker 3:  before that was always kinda like, yeah, it's like a, it's a little bit more

361
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:03,445
Speaker 3:  money. It was like, it's sort of 13 9 9 or something right before 29. Yeah,

362
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:06,605
Speaker 3:  I think that's right. And you get 'em on sale and it was like slightly better

363
00:21:06,605 --> 00:21:08,725
Speaker 3:  and the screen was a little better and the performance was basically the

364
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,445
Speaker 3:  same. Like they really did, I think for one minute the

365
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,765
Speaker 3:  M1 pro and the M1 air, the difference was the pro had a fan

366
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,845
Speaker 3:  so it didn't throttle as hard. Yeah, that's right. And that was the entire

367
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,485
Speaker 3:  performance difference in these computers. Yeah. And so they were just like

368
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:26,685
Speaker 3:  smushed together. And now I think Apple has enough M series chips

369
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:31,005
Speaker 3:  in enough configurations and enough display configurations to

370
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,985
Speaker 3:  meaningfully differentiate the products. And so, you know, eventually

371
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:37,305
Speaker 3:  there'll be an, is there an M four air? There's not M four air.

372
00:21:37,605 --> 00:21:38,545
Speaker 4:  No, I got Right.

373
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:41,945
Speaker 3:  So, you know, eventually there'll be an M four error, but then they'll put

374
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:45,785
Speaker 3:  an M five in the pro and like now they just have enough products

375
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:49,705
Speaker 3:  like at every level of the computer to actually pull them apart and create

376
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:53,025
Speaker 3:  differentiation. And I think that M four Pro, if you're,

377
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:55,985
Speaker 3:  you know, a college student who's interested in editing video or like doing

378
00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:59,625
Speaker 3:  photos like this thing is a meaningful improvement over the air without breaking

379
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,305
Speaker 3:  the bank. Yeah. Do you need a nano texture screen? Like, I don't know, but

380
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:06,985
Speaker 3:  like, but I, I think it's actually interesting to see

381
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:10,865
Speaker 3:  Apple, right? I mean this company is defined by, its like mastery of the

382
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:14,345
Speaker 3:  supply chain. They're using their supply chain mastery to actually create

383
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:17,785
Speaker 3:  reasonable gaps between their products in a way that I don't think they could

384
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:18,705
Speaker 3:  quite get to before.

385
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:23,105
Speaker 4:  I agree. And also it, it makes the whole lineup easier to

386
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:26,145
Speaker 4:  explain, right? Like I feel like on the one hand you now have the, the air

387
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:30,025
Speaker 4:  and the mini, which exists kind of on the like regular person

388
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:33,785
Speaker 4:  computer side. And then you have the studio and the pro

389
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:37,985
Speaker 4:  as the sort of obvious upgrades. Although

390
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:41,505
Speaker 4:  the mini in the studio are closer to each other than they should be. But

391
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:45,065
Speaker 4:  the studio will get an upgrade and like you get what they're going for and

392
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:49,385
Speaker 4:  then the, the studio and the pro are like for people who mostly need these

393
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:52,305
Speaker 4:  four professional reasons and they have some upgrades that go with it. You

394
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:56,025
Speaker 4:  know, more ports, more power, like all that stuff. And then the Mac Pro

395
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:59,905
Speaker 4:  just like exists off on the side. But that there is now

396
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:03,785
Speaker 4:  a, a sort of consumer desktop and a consumer laptop and a professional

397
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:08,185
Speaker 4:  desktop and a professional laptop has not been the case with Apple's

398
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:12,105
Speaker 4:  max in a very long time. And this, this is like the cleanest this

399
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:13,625
Speaker 4:  lineup has felt to me in a very long time.

400
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:17,705
Speaker 3:  Right. And then there's the iMac, the desktop for receptionists. Like yeah

401
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:21,585
Speaker 4:  We, we basically don't talk about the iMac anymore. It's like the iMac

402
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:24,945
Speaker 4:  is If. you want an iMac buy an iMac, it's the iPad Mini of

403
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:25,905
Speaker 4:  Macs

404
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:29,425
Speaker 3:  Pilots. Pilots are walking onto planes. The iMac trapped in their thighs.

405
00:23:29,425 --> 00:23:33,065
Speaker 3:  Exactly. I really am gonna take apart my old iMac make it a

406
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:36,865
Speaker 3:  display and then iMac mini for I just need to create the time

407
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,345
Speaker 3:  for like no one in my family is like, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna

408
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:44,145
Speaker 3:  give you a full afternoon to disassemble a 10-year-old computer and

409
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:45,105
Speaker 3:  turn it into a display.

410
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:49,365
Speaker 4:  I will say we, we got a lot of people after we talked about this what

411
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:53,245
Speaker 4:  last week saying they have the same problem. There are a lot

412
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:56,565
Speaker 4:  of people out there sitting with like functionally useless

413
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:01,045
Speaker 4:  IMAX that are still big beautiful displays that you just kind of

414
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:04,965
Speaker 4:  stare at it and you're like, why can't I use you and So I think

415
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:08,925
Speaker 4:  if we can solve this for people, this is yet another side business that

416
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,845
Speaker 4:  we're gonna start where we're just gonna fix computers,

417
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:13,405
Speaker 3:  We're gonna call the I Fix It folks. We're, we're good friends with them

418
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:17,205
Speaker 3:  and we're gonna, we're gonna figure out a way to, to do this as a community

419
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:21,925
Speaker 3:  and that means David's gonna drive a van around the country fixing your

420
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:25,405
Speaker 3:  iMac and turning it into display. It's gonna be great. Yeah.

421
00:24:25,545 --> 00:24:26,045
Speaker 4:  I'm into it.

422
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:29,165
Speaker 3:  It's a new sponsorship opportunity. If, you thought the lightning round was

423
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:32,565
Speaker 3:  exclusive? David's iMac repair van

424
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,085
Speaker 4:  Sponsor the iMac van.

425
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:38,725
Speaker 3:  It's gonna be incredible. Last little bit of Gadget News,

426
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,205
Speaker 3:  we should talk about the Kindle color. Soft it. Oof.

427
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:45,765
Speaker 3:  That's it. That, I mean that's, that's kind of the whole story.

428
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:50,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Tough, tough, tough beat for Amazon, which

429
00:24:50,915 --> 00:24:54,645
Speaker 4:  came out with this whole lineup of new Kindles including the Color Soft,

430
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:58,245
Speaker 4:  the first color Kindle. And a bunch of people were like, Hey Amazon, why'd

431
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:01,325
Speaker 4:  you take so long to do Color Cobo and books and others have been doing color

432
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:04,765
Speaker 4:  for a while. And Amazon Pan Spin came on this show

433
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:08,965
Speaker 4:  and said basically in as many words, because it took us this long to get

434
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,765
Speaker 4:  it right, this is, we we did it, everybody else did bad color

435
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:16,685
Speaker 4:  and we did good color. And then a bunch of people started getting color softs

436
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:20,325
Speaker 4:  and it turns out they have this weird like

437
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:24,445
Speaker 4:  faded yellow band at the bottom. And there are, there are a bunch of

438
00:25:24,445 --> 00:25:27,965
Speaker 4:  reasons I've seen for why this might happen. There's, there's some

439
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:32,165
Speaker 4:  speculation that it's, it's a UI thing that just doesn't fade

440
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:36,285
Speaker 4:  properly when you switch out of like the library view into a book.

441
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:38,645
Speaker 4:  It just doesn't pull that color off the screen.

442
00:25:40,175 --> 00:25:43,995
Speaker 4:  Amazon seems to have kind of freaked out at this.

443
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:46,715
Speaker 4:  Like If, you look at the Kindle color soft page right now, the reviews are

444
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:50,595
Speaker 4:  really bad. There's a ton of 'em. People hate this thing. And there have

445
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,835
Speaker 4:  also been a couple of other issues like it was supposed to ship with a dark

446
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:56,275
Speaker 4:  mode and then Amazon just didn't ship it with the dark mode.

447
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:59,555
Speaker 4:  There was like a, a feature that was advertised that just doesn't exist on

448
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:03,075
Speaker 4:  this thing and they had to delay shipping. Like this thing has actually turned

449
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:06,035
Speaker 4:  into kind of a mess in a way that for Amazon,

450
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,915
Speaker 4:  which has basically like ruthlessly executed on

451
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:14,905
Speaker 4:  slight improvements to the Kindle for 15 years is very

452
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:18,185
Speaker 4:  strange. And it's super weird because I'm sitting here with like the new

453
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:21,985
Speaker 4:  paper white, which I love to bits like that that thing is, it's excellent.

454
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:25,425
Speaker 4:  It is everything you would want like a super simple kindle to be

455
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:29,785
Speaker 4:  and the color soft kind of just looks like a swing and a miss. Yeah,

456
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:34,305
Speaker 3:  But I mean the paper white is an incremental improvement, right? They

457
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:38,225
Speaker 3:  made the page turn speed a lot faster. Yeah, but it's the same product

458
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:41,345
Speaker 3:  and you this point you're making about Amazon sort of relentlessly improving

459
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:46,325
Speaker 3:  the same tiny iterations. I think people buy them and they just expect

460
00:26:46,325 --> 00:26:47,645
Speaker 3:  them to work. Like you expect

461
00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:51,925
Speaker 3:  99.9% similar functionality out of any

462
00:26:51,925 --> 00:26:52,325
Speaker 3:  Kindle.

463
00:26:52,765 --> 00:26:53,805
Speaker 4:  A hundred percent. Yeah.

464
00:26:53,805 --> 00:26:56,245
Speaker 3:  Like I expect, I was like, do you want a new one? And she literally, she

465
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:58,965
Speaker 3:  looked me dead in the eye. She reads her Kindle every night. She looked me

466
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,885
Speaker 3:  dead in the eye and said Stop buying me Kindles 'cause it's

467
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,925
Speaker 3:  the only gadget I can buy or should care of anything else. And she was like,

468
00:27:05,995 --> 00:27:09,885
Speaker 3:  stop it. Like I'm good. Yeah. I will let you know when this one catches fire.

469
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:11,405
Speaker 3:  And that was the end of that conversation.

470
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:14,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I think like the, that's the, the new paperweight in is

471
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:18,605
Speaker 4:  that but slightly better in a bunch of ways, which is to some extent, like

472
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:21,365
Speaker 4:  it's what Becky and what a lot of people want from a paperweight, right?

473
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:24,645
Speaker 4:  Like go faster when I press the thing to change the page.

474
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,925
Speaker 3:  Right. The color soft is the big change's

475
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:28,485
Speaker 4:  Supposed to be the new thing. Yeah.

476
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:29,765
Speaker 3:  And you have to get that right.

477
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And especially if you're gonna come out and be like, oh we, we took

478
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:36,685
Speaker 4:  a long time to do this, but we think we've gotten it right. There have been

479
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:37,525
Speaker 4:  all these, also

480
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,805
Speaker 3:  You're in our DRM jail, so you'll only eat when we feed you.

481
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:45,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a tough look and I think it's gonna be

482
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,685
Speaker 4:  really interesting. There's this new scribe coming out in a few weeks with

483
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:52,285
Speaker 4:  a bunch of like flashy AI stuff. Like they, they

484
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:55,685
Speaker 4:  pitched this as the biggest rev to the Kindle line ever.

485
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:56,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

486
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:58,485
Speaker 3:  Panelists was here. He was like, I I set 'em free.

487
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:03,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And if If you, if your big first swing goes like this,

488
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,375
Speaker 4:  that is tough. I,

489
00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:09,895
Speaker 3:  They said why? It's just like manufacturing error. Did they somebody step

490
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:10,375
Speaker 3:  on 'em like

491
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,015
Speaker 4:  They haven't said they've, they've essentially just acknowledged that it

492
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:16,935
Speaker 4:  is a real problem. Our review unit has one enter the Shefsky has been using

493
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:20,855
Speaker 4:  it and has seen the yellow bar. His stance so far seems to be that

494
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:24,815
Speaker 4:  it is worse in photos than in real life, but it is still

495
00:28:24,815 --> 00:28:28,695
Speaker 4:  very much real and there and Amazon has acknowledged to

496
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:31,855
Speaker 4:  lots of people and according to people on Reddit, which take with a grain

497
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:35,695
Speaker 4:  of salt, Amazon has actually been calling people who have had, who have

498
00:28:35,695 --> 00:28:38,855
Speaker 4:  left bad reviews and bought the thing to see what's going on. Like

499
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:43,335
Speaker 4:  you get the sense the company is scrambling that this has

500
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:47,175
Speaker 4:  been such a big problem, but Amazon has acknowledged that this is a

501
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:50,455
Speaker 4:  real thing and is an issue and that they are trying to fix it. Is

502
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:52,295
Speaker 3:  It a hardware issue or a software issue?

503
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:53,375
Speaker 4:  Unclear.

504
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:54,735
Speaker 3:  Wow.

505
00:28:55,245 --> 00:28:58,855
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's a bad look. I mean right now I'm just gonna, I'm gonna open,

506
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:03,465
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna open the Kindle Color soft page and I'm just gonna like,

507
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:05,785
Speaker 4:  so the reviews are truly, truly, truly brutal

508
00:29:07,925 --> 00:29:11,865
Speaker 4:  in a way that like the Kindle is every, everybody is like, it's a Kindle.

509
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:15,745
Speaker 4:  I like my Kindle. The Color Soft, which I would remind you

510
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:19,645
Speaker 4:  is $280 way more expensive currently

511
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:22,125
Speaker 4:  at 2.6 stars on Amazon.

512
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:23,885
Speaker 3:  Oh it is a hardware problem.

513
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:25,125
Speaker 4:  It is. We

514
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:28,365
Speaker 3:  Have a quote. The company is making adjustments so that new devices will

515
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:31,685
Speaker 3:  not have the yellow band. People who already own a unit can contact Amazon

516
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:35,285
Speaker 3:  for a refund or replacement in the statement from an Amazon spokesperson

517
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:39,045
Speaker 3:  to us, we take the quality of our product seriously. Customers who notice

518
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,645
Speaker 3:  Jail Bank can reach out to customer service team for replacement or a refund.

519
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:45,695
Speaker 4:  Could be either way. Maybe hardware, maybe. Yeah, who knows.

520
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:50,415
Speaker 4:  But yeah, Amazon claims there's a fix, so we'll see. Right now you also

521
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:54,255
Speaker 4:  can only get delivery. I'm seeing delivery for two weeks from now, which

522
00:29:54,255 --> 00:29:57,095
Speaker 4:  is a thing that has started showing up. Amazon seems to have like frozen

523
00:29:57,415 --> 00:29:59,135
Speaker 4:  shipping on this while they try to fix it.

524
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:02,335
Speaker 3:  I feel so bad for 'em. They're such a struggling company with so little money.

525
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:05,975
Speaker 4:  I know, it's awful. Hopefully, hopefully they get it together. Real upstart

526
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:08,895
Speaker 4:  ebook company. Hope they can get it together.

527
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:11,735
Speaker 3:  It's funny 'cause this was, this really was the first like

528
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:16,365
Speaker 3:  revitalized Amazon hardware. Here we go here off the chain

529
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:20,005
Speaker 4:  And there was so much enthusiasm for it. Like I I I was actually really surprised

530
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:23,725
Speaker 4:  at how excited people were about the Color soft because on the one hand it's

531
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:27,485
Speaker 4:  not a giant sort of leap in functionality for most people.

532
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:31,325
Speaker 4:  It's just like now your book covers are in color, but a for people

533
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:33,765
Speaker 4:  who like carry these things around and have them sitting on their night table

534
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:37,605
Speaker 4:  like that alone is meaningful. But also I heard from a

535
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:40,845
Speaker 4:  lot of like comic book fans and people who love graphic novels and people

536
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:43,965
Speaker 4:  who are like this, this actually changes the kind of thing I can do on this

537
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:47,925
Speaker 4:  device. And again, it's, it's 80 or $90

538
00:30:48,035 --> 00:30:51,445
Speaker 4:  more than the Paperweight. Like it's not a small choice to buy this thing

539
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:55,245
Speaker 4:  instead of a different Kindle. And it, it just, I feel

540
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:57,965
Speaker 4:  for all the people who have just like thought this was the thing they'd been

541
00:30:57,965 --> 00:30:59,045
Speaker 4:  waiting for and it turned out it

542
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:01,565
Speaker 3:  Wasn't. This is why you gotta stick with the boos Palmer man.

543
00:31:02,805 --> 00:31:05,845
Speaker 4:  I dunno. Do you want one? I have a, I have a Palma two right here. What do

544
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:09,485
Speaker 4:  you think? Can I just quickly preview my Palma two review for you? Yes.

545
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,965
Speaker 4:  I picked it up to do some testing and play with it and do some reviews

546
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:17,605
Speaker 4:  and an hour later realized I had picked up the original one instead of the

547
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:17,885
Speaker 4:  second one.

548
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:20,005
Speaker 3:  That's perfect. Yeah,

549
00:31:20,185 --> 00:31:20,965
Speaker 4:  That's where we are.

550
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:21,925
Speaker 3:  That's very good.

551
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:55,245
Speaker 3:  We're back. Sean Hollister is here. Welcome Sean.

552
00:32:55,945 --> 00:32:56,165
Speaker 6:  Hi.

553
00:32:57,235 --> 00:33:01,205
Speaker 3:  It's the Voice. The voice of a new generation has returned once again to

554
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:01,645
Speaker 3:  the Vergecast.

555
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:02,885
Speaker 6:  I'm almost 40.

556
00:33:04,395 --> 00:33:07,085
Speaker 3:  Sean, you're not supposed to admit this. I don't know. It's this is, this

557
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,365
Speaker 3:  goes on YouTube. You have to say you're 18 years old and you can't read

558
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:13,045
Speaker 6:  It. It, it's good because, because look at my, look at my complexion. It's

559
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:13,405
Speaker 6:  just fine.

560
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,485
Speaker 3:  I have a lot of additional YouTube jokes to tell and I'm just not gonna tell

561
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:19,085
Speaker 3:  'em. If, you sponsor the lightning round. I'll call you personally and tell

562
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:20,965
Speaker 3:  you the jokes I was about to tell. They're not, they weren't about Sean,

563
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,165
Speaker 3:  they were about YouTube. That's the

564
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:25,205
Speaker 4:  Worst argument you've ever made for sponsoring the lightning round. No one

565
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:25,965
Speaker 4:  is gonna sponsor it

566
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:28,965
Speaker 3:  Now. We're gonna have more incoming now than we've ever gotten and, and we

567
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,765
Speaker 3:  still will not know how to accept the money. We're gonna figure it out one

568
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:34,125
Speaker 3:  day. It's not today.

569
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:40,045
Speaker 3:  All right, Sean, you're here because you reviewed The PS five Pro, which

570
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:43,605
Speaker 3:  the review the embargo of which was the day after election day.

571
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:48,325
Speaker 3:  So while everyone else is like glued to the screens, watching counts go up,

572
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:52,565
Speaker 3:  Sean, I believe you were just moving back from your television one inch at

573
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:56,445
Speaker 3:  a time to see when you could stop telling that

574
00:33:56,445 --> 00:33:59,285
Speaker 3:  The PS five Pro had in increased resolution in bloodborne.

575
00:33:59,685 --> 00:34:02,565
Speaker 6:  I, I wanna tell you that you're incorrect, but that was literally exactly

576
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:06,125
Speaker 6:  what I was doing. I I, I was walking up really close to my TV

577
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:10,845
Speaker 6:  to see all the glorious pixels and then continually walking backwards

578
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:14,565
Speaker 6:  until I couldn't see the difference anymore between a 4-year-old

579
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:16,325
Speaker 6:  PlayStation and a brand new PlayStation.

580
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:20,645
Speaker 3:  I love this. This is what we do here. First, tell people what The PS five

581
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:22,965
Speaker 3:  Pro is and then explain why you were doing exactly that.

582
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:27,405
Speaker 6:  Okay, The PS five Pro is Sony's new game console,

583
00:34:27,405 --> 00:34:31,125
Speaker 6:  which is basically a PS five with B storage,

584
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:35,285
Speaker 6:  a little more memory and a substantially faster GPU,

585
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:39,005
Speaker 6:  the GPU itself, 62% faster by tariff

586
00:34:39,015 --> 00:34:42,605
Speaker 6:  flops. You get rendering performance increases of like

587
00:34:42,605 --> 00:34:46,405
Speaker 6:  45%. So it's not quite enough to take your games from aa.

588
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:50,925
Speaker 6:  They weren't 4K before to suddenly they are 4K

589
00:34:50,985 --> 00:34:54,325
Speaker 6:  except there's also AI upscaling on board because of course everything has

590
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:58,205
Speaker 6:  AI in it now. And so with that, you can

591
00:34:58,315 --> 00:35:01,605
Speaker 6:  theoretically get a best of both worlds experience

592
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:06,085
Speaker 6:  where if previously your PS five game was running at 4K,

593
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:10,045
Speaker 6:  but only 30 frames per second, now you can run it at a smooth 60.

594
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:14,605
Speaker 6:  Or if your game was previously lower resolution

595
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:18,485
Speaker 6:  at 60 frames per second, you can now get higher resolution and more detail

596
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:22,565
Speaker 6:  at the 60 frames per second. And so you put your existing games

597
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:26,045
Speaker 6:  in this and if they've been patched to PS five Pro

598
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:30,045
Speaker 6:  enhanced, then all of a sudden they look better or they run smoother and

599
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,845
Speaker 6:  that's great. Right? It's it's, it's PS five but better. Yeah, it's also

600
00:35:33,895 --> 00:35:34,965
Speaker 6:  $700.

601
00:35:35,185 --> 00:35:38,845
Speaker 3:  That's a lot of dollars. It does have the little like rib on the side.

602
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:42,845
Speaker 4:  It does look nice. Yeah, it's got like a little racing stripey thing. I'm,

603
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:45,685
Speaker 4:  I'm, I'm into that. But wait, Sean, this is the thing I've been trying to

604
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,315
Speaker 4:  figure out about The PS five Pro. It feels like there there could be

605
00:35:49,805 --> 00:35:53,355
Speaker 4:  three different GA kinds of games for this. One is like

606
00:35:54,145 --> 00:35:58,115
Speaker 4:  game that is not aware of the existence of The PS five Pro. It's

607
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:01,995
Speaker 4:  just, it's just a game. It's a PS four game. It's a PS five game. The other

608
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:05,395
Speaker 4:  one is like a game that already existed that has been like

609
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:08,755
Speaker 4:  upgraded in some way to be ready for this. And then there are like

610
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:12,715
Speaker 4:  theoretically games made with The PS five Pro in

611
00:36:12,715 --> 00:36:16,555
Speaker 4:  mind. Do all three of those things exist in The PS five Pro

612
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:20,035
Speaker 4:  World? Like if I put in a game that just does not care about The PS five

613
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,995
Speaker 4:  Pro at all, is it gonna look better?

614
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:26,555
Speaker 6:  In many cases it won't look

615
00:36:26,555 --> 00:36:30,195
Speaker 6:  better if it doesn't know that you've got a PS five pro in there. But there

616
00:36:30,215 --> 00:36:34,115
Speaker 6:  are so many edge cases here. This is a very

617
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:37,595
Speaker 6:  difficult review to write. Okay, so we, we we, we have let, let's start off

618
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,355
Speaker 6:  with the, with the obvious. Like are there new games that are only for The

619
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:44,475
Speaker 6:  PS five Pro? Will there be exclusive games that old wrote on this?

620
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:48,795
Speaker 6:  Probably not. Sony has not said anything to suggest that that will happen.

621
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:52,635
Speaker 6:  They will probably save those for The PS six, whenever that comes

622
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:56,515
Speaker 6:  out. And even those theoretically, maybe they'll let those

623
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:59,875
Speaker 6:  run on a PS five and a PS five pro as well. You could

624
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:03,995
Speaker 6:  theoretically now have a be in a place where games are like PCs, you

625
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:06,355
Speaker 6:  get your new PlayStation, they look a little better. You play above the old

626
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:10,235
Speaker 6:  PlayStation, they look worse. It's all X 86 under the hook. Now it's

627
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:13,955
Speaker 6:  possible. It's all a OD chips under the hood. Now it's possible. Has

628
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,995
Speaker 6:  Sony actually done that? Not quite. They would of course like you to buy

629
00:37:16,995 --> 00:37:20,795
Speaker 6:  games again and again and buy the updates for those games. So to some

630
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:21,675
Speaker 6:  degree that's not happening.

631
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:25,315
Speaker 3:  I mean there are barely even PS five only games, right? I mean I'm, I'm,

632
00:37:25,615 --> 00:37:29,595
Speaker 3:  I'm looking at the list of PS five only games and it is just not that

633
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:29,795
Speaker 3:  many.

634
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:33,875
Speaker 6:  There aren't PS five only games, but there are a lot of PS five only versions

635
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:37,155
Speaker 6:  of games. Yeah, If, you put The PS five disc in like you were getting a different

636
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:40,395
Speaker 6:  and better experience than The PS four version. Absolutely a hundred percent

637
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:44,195
Speaker 6:  like that is a much bigger difference also than the difference between PS

638
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,235
Speaker 6:  five and PS five Pro. Okay, so the second question is,

639
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:51,835
Speaker 6:  you've got your no exclusives, no exclusives for this, but then

640
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,595
Speaker 6:  you do have games that do not necessarily

641
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:59,715
Speaker 6:  need the patches. They don't necessarily need to develop or put in the extra

642
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,755
Speaker 6:  legwork to make a game run better because

643
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:06,675
Speaker 6:  some PS five games have an unlocked frame rate.

644
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:10,875
Speaker 6:  Now most of the time you're like a console experience, it's gonna be a smooth

645
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:14,675
Speaker 6:  60 or it's gonna be a smooth 30 FPS. The developers decided we're going to

646
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:17,595
Speaker 6:  lock it there. So you don't have up and down in terms of the performance.

647
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:21,395
Speaker 6:  You, you got a reliable frame rate. But because there's

648
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:25,155
Speaker 6:  so much difference in power between PS four and PS four Pro

649
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:28,875
Speaker 6:  and PS five and now PS five Pro, some developers are like, well

650
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:32,955
Speaker 6:  no, if we leave our games in this pclike state

651
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:36,885
Speaker 6:  where If you just throw more performance at them, they'll be better. There

652
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:40,005
Speaker 6:  are a handful of games like that Digital Foundry tested, you know, cyberpunk

653
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:43,525
Speaker 6:  2077 and it's like, oh okay that works.

654
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:47,685
Speaker 6:  But there's this other wrinkle in here, which is that If, you have a

655
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:50,805
Speaker 6:  TV with a variable refresh rate on it,

656
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,725
Speaker 6:  especially one that can go all the way up to 120 Hertz.

657
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:58,365
Speaker 6:  You put a game on this with that unlocked frame rate

658
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:03,485
Speaker 6:  and now your game that was only running 30 frames per second could

659
00:39:03,505 --> 00:39:07,445
Speaker 6:  run 40 or 47 or something like that. If, you play this

660
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:11,405
Speaker 6:  exact same game on a TV with a locked number of Hertz,

661
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:15,445
Speaker 6:  a locked refresh rate, you're only getting the 30 or the 60 If, you

662
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:19,125
Speaker 6:  can't hit the 60, you're at 30. You know, so we're in that place

663
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:23,005
Speaker 6:  where If, you have the best TV and you have an unlocked

664
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:26,805
Speaker 6:  frame rate game, then you don't need a PS five pro enhanced

665
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:30,765
Speaker 6:  patch to get some excellent enhancements out of it. Most of

666
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,325
Speaker 6:  the time though, you're gonna want these patches

667
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,885
Speaker 4:  Is the market for what you just described, 11 people

668
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:40,245
Speaker 4:  like, I don't know, I'm not, I'm not a

669
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:44,685
Speaker 4:  guy with a variable refresh tv, but like, but that's your fault.

670
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:47,765
Speaker 4:  That's a personal failing a David, you don't disagree.

671
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:52,445
Speaker 6:  Listen, nobody should buy this unless they have a

672
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:56,045
Speaker 6:  65 inch variable refresh rate

673
00:39:56,805 --> 00:40:00,565
Speaker 6:  HDR probably ole TV that they

674
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:04,485
Speaker 6:  sit at least that no more than eight feet away from, you know, they're sitting

675
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,805
Speaker 6:  close to this screen, preferably like five feet,

676
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:12,525
Speaker 6:  maybe three, three would be good. I I I I'm sitting

677
00:40:12,545 --> 00:40:16,405
Speaker 6:  in front of a 32 inch 4K monitor that, that OLED

678
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:20,325
Speaker 6:  monitor. It's a beautiful Alienware monitor and I I, I like The PS

679
00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:22,445
Speaker 6:  five Pro a lot on this screen. So, but

680
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:25,525
Speaker 4:  That's, that's actually I, I think a good point because you and you, you

681
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:29,365
Speaker 4:  make the same point in the review, which is that you basically find

682
00:40:29,525 --> 00:40:32,565
Speaker 4:  yourself using it like a gaming pc. This is not like a

683
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:37,245
Speaker 4:  plop it in the TV entertainment center, sit back on

684
00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:40,045
Speaker 4:  the couch and game kind of thing. This is like

685
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:44,885
Speaker 4:  sit three inches from the screen until your eyes bleed kind

686
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,365
Speaker 4:  of quality. This

687
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:49,885
Speaker 6:  Is the same argument we had about the steam deck. I mean people

688
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:54,205
Speaker 6:  love the idea of a gaming pc but they don't want all of that

689
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:58,125
Speaker 6:  hassle, right? And the steam deck is like, here is so much less hassle. Take

690
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,645
Speaker 6:  it with you. It just works for the most part. Even though it's running Linux

691
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:04,845
Speaker 6:  under the hood, these Windows games just work. Just start 'em up. We, we

692
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:07,405
Speaker 6:  guarantee that these ones will work and Valve doesn't always guarantee them

693
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:11,005
Speaker 6:  properly. PS five Pro, plug that into your desktop monitor,

694
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:15,045
Speaker 6:  pick up your dual sense controller. It's amazing controller and these

695
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,325
Speaker 6:  games just work and they look beautiful, right?

696
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:21,365
Speaker 4:  This is why I bring this up because I think If, you look at it that way,

697
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:25,725
Speaker 4:  you're no longer competing against a much

698
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:29,485
Speaker 4:  cheaper, almost as good PS five, you're competing against a way more

699
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:32,605
Speaker 4:  expensive, way more fiddly, way more complicated gaming pc.

700
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:36,725
Speaker 3:  Wait, so Sean, you mentioned this in the review, you said this is like the

701
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:39,485
Speaker 3:  power of a mid-range gaming pc, right? It's somewhere in there.

702
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,805
Speaker 3:  Is that so much more complicated and expensive,

703
00:41:43,525 --> 00:41:45,645
Speaker 6:  A mid-range gaming pc Yeah,

704
00:41:45,645 --> 00:41:46,325
Speaker 3:  You have to run Windows.

705
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:50,765
Speaker 6:  Exactly that. That's really it. That's really that and, and,

706
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:54,725
Speaker 6:  and, and ports. I mean Sony has ported a lot of good

707
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:57,845
Speaker 6:  games to gaming PCs now it's, it's various port

708
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:02,205
Speaker 6:  studios like Nixies have done this and some of

709
00:42:02,205 --> 00:42:06,045
Speaker 6:  them are great and some of them are really, really not great. I

710
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:09,805
Speaker 6:  booted up the last of us part one on both my

711
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:13,565
Speaker 6:  PS five Pro and my gaming pc. And trust me, the gaming

712
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:17,485
Speaker 6:  PC has more oomph under the hood. The graphics card in there, you're gonna

713
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:20,925
Speaker 6:  get more frame rate, more textures. I proved that out by playing Alan wait

714
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:24,685
Speaker 6:  too. But with Last of Us part one, it is not a good port on

715
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:28,885
Speaker 6:  pc. The little girl's hair in the beginning of the game, it looks

716
00:42:28,885 --> 00:42:32,765
Speaker 6:  like Medusa like tentacles on my PC because there is some kind of

717
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:37,005
Speaker 6:  bug. She is also a vampire apparently because there was, she has no

718
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:40,805
Speaker 6:  reflection in any of the mirrors on pc, on The PS five Pro The

719
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:44,565
Speaker 6:  mirrors show the entire world, including her. Also it took

720
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:48,085
Speaker 6:  like a minute to load the game fully on

721
00:42:48,475 --> 00:42:52,365
Speaker 6:  less than that, maybe 30 seconds to load the game on PS five Pro. I spent

722
00:42:52,515 --> 00:42:55,845
Speaker 6:  15 minutes compiling the shaders for the game on pc

723
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,485
Speaker 6:  after which point it still didn't work properly.

724
00:42:58,755 --> 00:43:02,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah, so is it worth it? I mean I look, I have a PS five, I play one game

725
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:06,245
Speaker 3:  on it. I I throw interceptions in Madden. I do that for about an hour every

726
00:43:06,245 --> 00:43:06,525
Speaker 3:  night before

727
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,645
Speaker 4:  On frame tv, which feels important to say out loud at

728
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:13,405
Speaker 3:  This moment on my, my 77 inch Sony Master series Ole, which does have

729
00:43:13,445 --> 00:43:14,525
Speaker 3:  VRR actually. Okay, there you go.

730
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:19,765
Speaker 3:  No one in my house enjoys when I do this. There's a lot of swearing tv

731
00:43:20,385 --> 00:43:23,465
Speaker 3:  but this isn't a game. I doubt they're gonna update Madden. The the only

732
00:43:23,465 --> 00:43:26,505
Speaker 3:  thing they're gonna update madness with like is more interstitial advertising

733
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:30,265
Speaker 3:  to buy their weird cards. That's those the only updates this game.

734
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:33,025
Speaker 3:  Is this worth it for me? This it feels like not at all worth it to me.

735
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:34,865
Speaker 6:  No, no wait for a PS six oh

736
00:43:35,285 --> 00:43:39,225
Speaker 3:  Max plays Abot. My 6-year-old plays the hell out of astronaut, which is

737
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:43,265
Speaker 3:  the best game in the world. And the astro bot dual suns controller is

738
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:47,425
Speaker 3:  actually delightful 'cause the light around the touch pad glows in different

739
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,985
Speaker 3:  colors when you play the game. The whole thing's delight.

740
00:43:50,205 --> 00:43:53,225
Speaker 6:  We played the hell out of Astro Bot. I did not notice a difference.

741
00:43:53,455 --> 00:43:53,945
Speaker 3:  Alright,

742
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,425
Speaker 4:  Are there games that you feel like it's worth it? Like is is there a game

743
00:43:57,425 --> 00:44:01,395
Speaker 4:  that it's like, if I play this game for hours a day, this upgrade

744
00:44:01,535 --> 00:44:03,555
Speaker 4:  is, is that meaningful all on its own?

745
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:07,635
Speaker 6:  You would have to be an Uber fan and it might need to be something competitive.

746
00:44:07,735 --> 00:44:11,715
Speaker 6:  And this is one place I did, I didn't get to try like Call of Duty

747
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:16,115
Speaker 6:  on this with like in in like intensive multiplay. I don't even know if there

748
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:19,955
Speaker 6:  is like a fast refresh mode. But let's imagine for

749
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:23,795
Speaker 6:  a moment you have like imagine Call of Duty or or

750
00:44:23,815 --> 00:44:27,515
Speaker 6:  or or really competitive fighting game comes out with an

751
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:31,075
Speaker 6:  120 hertz mode and all of a sudden

752
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,925
Speaker 6:  this is like the best way to play outside of a pc because you actually have

753
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:38,885
Speaker 6:  like lowered latency from the, from your inputs into the thing. Or if they

754
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,445
Speaker 6:  also like let you use a mouse and keyboard, maybe that's what they need to

755
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:45,245
Speaker 6:  do. If they take this thing and they're like, it is your gaming pc every

756
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:48,245
Speaker 6:  game you throw it will be better because we are issuing a mandate that every

757
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:51,965
Speaker 6:  developer has to have unlocked frame rate and resolution and

758
00:44:52,165 --> 00:44:55,365
Speaker 6:  graphic setting options on all of their games. And we're gonna let you plug

759
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:59,365
Speaker 6:  a mouse and keyboard into it. And it basically is a pc except

760
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:01,965
Speaker 6:  it's a really cool and quiet and SM compact.

761
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,845
Speaker 3:  This is like Microsoft's dream of the PC for years. True. You were describing

762
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:06,885
Speaker 3:  the world's wildest surface rt.

763
00:45:11,385 --> 00:45:14,965
Speaker 6:  If you're a Final Fantasy seven Uber fan and like all you wanted

764
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:19,405
Speaker 6:  for your entire existence since 1997 or whenever it

765
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:23,045
Speaker 6:  was, was to see Final Fantasy seven turn

766
00:45:23,115 --> 00:45:27,005
Speaker 6:  into a you come to life around you. This still isn't that

767
00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:30,885
Speaker 6:  because it's not vr, but, but it's, it looks better than

768
00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:35,005
Speaker 6:  PS five for that. It's pretty muddy on PS five and in the 60 hertz mode.

769
00:45:35,395 --> 00:45:39,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I do like the idea that this is a weird incursion into gaming

770
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:43,225
Speaker 3:  PC world. It, it makes it make more sense to me. Whereas

771
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:46,665
Speaker 3:  when there's a PS four and The PS four Pro came out a little bit later,

772
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:50,225
Speaker 3:  there was just some like obvious reasons that I would want my, I would wanna

773
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:54,185
Speaker 3:  upgrade my console at that time. 'cause that's what got you 4K back

774
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:55,065
Speaker 3:  then. Did

775
00:45:55,065 --> 00:45:55,665
Speaker 6:  You upgrade David?

776
00:45:56,265 --> 00:46:00,025
Speaker 4:  I only got a PS four Pro. I still have a PS four Pro. I bought that

777
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:04,065
Speaker 4:  just because it was like, there was like a Black Friday sale. So I ended

778
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:07,825
Speaker 4:  up with it. But again, I I played that on a 10 80 p

779
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,145
Speaker 4:  computer monitor for a very long time. Do you have eyes I say these

780
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:14,945
Speaker 4:  things primarily just to piss off me. Like this is, it's great

781
00:46:15,645 --> 00:46:19,065
Speaker 6:  So I asked because all this means all of us are PS four pro owners. All of

782
00:46:19,065 --> 00:46:22,865
Speaker 6:  us bought into this last gen when the, when the pitch was

783
00:46:22,865 --> 00:46:26,505
Speaker 6:  like, now you get HDR and now you get like

784
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:28,185
Speaker 6:  4K, which is like, but

785
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,425
Speaker 3:  It was like fake 4K contrived,

786
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:33,345
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. Checkerboard rendering. But like, but the, the

787
00:46:33,345 --> 00:46:36,265
Speaker 6:  thing about, the thing about the, you have to be a certain feet amount of,

788
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:39,465
Speaker 6:  number of feet away from your PS five. Like not see the difference. You have

789
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:42,145
Speaker 6:  to be within eight feet to see, like really see the difference with PS five

790
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:46,145
Speaker 6:  Pro that worked in the favor of The PS

791
00:46:46,255 --> 00:46:50,225
Speaker 6:  four Pro because at the distance you were away from the screen,

792
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:53,945
Speaker 6:  you could tell that it was 4K, but you could not tell that it was

793
00:46:53,975 --> 00:46:57,105
Speaker 6:  contrived checkerboard rendering. At least I couldn't, maybe you couldn't,

794
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:57,625
Speaker 6:  Neil. I could

795
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:01,585
Speaker 3:  Not. Okay. But I but I you, this is not my, as everyone

796
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:05,465
Speaker 3:  knows, evaluating video games is not the thing that I do because I play two

797
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:08,865
Speaker 3:  of them and I'm horrible at one of them. So

798
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:13,265
Speaker 3:  like, it's, it's, don't take my word for it. But yeah, I, I agree with you

799
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:16,705
Speaker 3:  broadly that The PS four Pro made sense to me

800
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:20,585
Speaker 3:  'cause it got me the two features I wanted to use on my tv, right? Right.

801
00:47:20,945 --> 00:47:23,625
Speaker 3:  I want all the lights on my TV to be lit up as everyone knows. And so it

802
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:27,025
Speaker 3:  got me the 4K and it got me the HTR and that was great. This one is like

803
00:47:27,065 --> 00:47:30,965
Speaker 3:  I, whatever, it's more pixels. Like I always play in higher resolution mode

804
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:34,805
Speaker 3:  versus higher performance mode because I, that, that's the trade off I'm

805
00:47:34,805 --> 00:47:37,245
Speaker 3:  willing to make and I'm not willing to make this trade off. The idea that

806
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:41,125
Speaker 3:  The PS five Pro is actually meant to go up against

807
00:47:41,885 --> 00:47:44,765
Speaker 3:  a mid-range gaming PC and be simpler and faster and have a better library

808
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:48,285
Speaker 3:  of more optimized games. Kind of like,

809
00:47:48,715 --> 00:47:50,365
Speaker 3:  kind of re-contextualize the whole product.

810
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:54,575
Speaker 4:  I agree. And makes it way more like $700 seems a lot

811
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:55,015
Speaker 4:  less

812
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:57,415
Speaker 4:  wildly expensive.

813
00:47:57,795 --> 00:47:59,495
Speaker 3:  Is that how Sony is talking about it?

814
00:48:00,605 --> 00:48:02,025
Speaker 6:  No, absolutely not.

815
00:48:02,895 --> 00:48:03,785
Speaker 3:  Well, maybe they should start.

816
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:08,305
Speaker 3:  All right, so that's BS five, four. Anything we missed, Sean? Anything that

817
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:11,745
Speaker 3:  like stood out to you apart from that, how is the weird detachable disc drive

818
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:11,985
Speaker 3:  thing?

819
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:15,545
Speaker 6:  The detachable. Okay, so it doesn't, it does not come with the disc drive,

820
00:48:15,835 --> 00:48:19,825
Speaker 6:  which is like, how do you call it the pro when it

821
00:48:19,825 --> 00:48:23,225
Speaker 6:  doesn't have this feature? How do you, how do you release this console to

822
00:48:23,365 --> 00:48:27,145
Speaker 6:  an audience of nit pickers who are gonna care about those graphics in that

823
00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:30,145
Speaker 6:  frame? Right. But you think they magically don't care about,

824
00:48:30,915 --> 00:48:34,545
Speaker 6:  about physical media. Like Yeah, people care about physical media

825
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:38,505
Speaker 6:  if they're nit pickers and So I did have to special order the disc drive

826
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:40,465
Speaker 6:  and put it on this thing. It was so easy. Yeah, they're

827
00:48:40,465 --> 00:48:43,265
Speaker 4:  Hard to find, right? The, yeah. Test drives are not easy to get your hands

828
00:48:43,385 --> 00:48:43,545
Speaker 4:  on.

829
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,905
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I went, I looked at GameStop, I looked at Best Buy, I looked at Sony's

830
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:50,345
Speaker 6:  side, I looked a bunch of places, eventually found one at Walmart, not a

831
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:54,265
Speaker 6:  close Walmart, but I did, I did order it, it got to me next day. So

832
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:58,185
Speaker 6:  good. Good for you. Walmart. And I guess I'll scalp

833
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,265
Speaker 6:  it now. No, I'm not gonna scalp.

834
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:00,345
Speaker 4:  You probably could.

835
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:05,625
Speaker 6:  I really could. They're hotly in demand. Sony did not make enough

836
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:09,385
Speaker 6:  of these things, but, but yeah, it, it, it, it clips on really easily

837
00:49:09,815 --> 00:49:12,905
Speaker 6:  once it's on there, it looks like an original PS five.

838
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:17,225
Speaker 6:  And it's, and it's, it's smaller, you know, it's, it's, it's, and it's, and

839
00:49:17,225 --> 00:49:20,905
Speaker 6:  it's fairly quiet and not that warm.

840
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:23,945
Speaker 6:  Like I'm using it, it's under the desk right now. I'm using it as a foot

841
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:27,465
Speaker 6:  warmer while we do this. It's, it's, it's currently Ray tracing at Wake two

842
00:49:28,205 --> 00:49:31,945
Speaker 6:  and it's, it's enough to warm up my feet a little bit, but it's not,

843
00:49:31,945 --> 00:49:34,585
Speaker 6:  they're not super toasty. And I would say it's,

844
00:49:35,735 --> 00:49:39,425
Speaker 3:  This is how we're measuring heat and thermals on every product from

845
00:49:39,545 --> 00:49:43,025
Speaker 3:  now on. Like, did it make my feet super toasty

846
00:49:43,395 --> 00:49:44,945
Speaker 3:  under the desk? It's very good.

847
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:50,745
Speaker 6:  It's quieter than the original Steve Deck was. The Steve original Steve Deck

848
00:49:50,745 --> 00:49:53,105
Speaker 6:  had a really noisy fan. This is quieter that

849
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:57,425
Speaker 3:  Have they added Dolby vision to The PS five yet. If, you wanna play

850
00:49:57,425 --> 00:50:01,145
Speaker 3:  Blu-rays on it. I don't think they have. Don't all this extra processing

851
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:03,665
Speaker 3:  power and I just want Dolby vision support. And then I would buy a new PS

852
00:50:03,665 --> 00:50:06,545
Speaker 3:  five Pro with this disc drive and I would use it as Blu-Ray player.

853
00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:09,785
Speaker 6:  I bought the Samsung Go LED TV this time. So, I don't have Dolby vision either

854
00:50:09,785 --> 00:50:09,985
Speaker 6:  way.

855
00:50:10,205 --> 00:50:10,425
Speaker 3:  Oh

856
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:11,305
Speaker 6:  My God. Sean, sorry,

857
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:15,745
Speaker 3:  Everyone, can everyone just check in with me? Just send me a note

858
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,905
Speaker 3:  and I'll help you out. I'm doing my best out here, Neil.

859
00:50:19,025 --> 00:50:22,905
Speaker 4:  I have a 42 inch P series TCL I'm looking at, can you give

860
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:23,505
Speaker 4:  me a once over,

861
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:27,725
Speaker 3:  I walked into a new neighbor's house the other day and he

862
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:32,175
Speaker 3:  showed me the TV about the mantle and he goes, it's, it's not, it's like

863
00:50:32,175 --> 00:50:34,895
Speaker 3:  a different kind of frame tv. And I was like, I can't, I have to get outta

864
00:50:34,895 --> 00:50:38,805
Speaker 3:  this house because he, he hadn't bought it because I,

865
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:41,605
Speaker 3:  there's a bunch of competitors to frame TV now and I was like, I gotta go,

866
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:45,565
Speaker 3:  I gotta get outta here. I just immediately call. I don't know you well enough

867
00:50:45,785 --> 00:50:48,885
Speaker 3:  to react to what you just said to me the way that I want to.

868
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:52,925
Speaker 3:  And I don't have control over my emotions. So, I have to just leave.

869
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:53,765
Speaker 4:  That's good.

870
00:50:55,415 --> 00:50:59,245
Speaker 3:  Other gaming news. It seems like everyone keeps expecting Nintendo

871
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:03,045
Speaker 3:  to actually announce what should be called the Super Nintendo Switch

872
00:51:03,395 --> 00:51:07,365
Speaker 3:  Hint. But instead they've announced an alarm clock and then on,

873
00:51:07,725 --> 00:51:11,165
Speaker 3:  I believe it was on election night, announced that the forthcoming switch

874
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:13,045
Speaker 3:  successor would be backwards compatible. Well no, you,

875
00:51:13,045 --> 00:51:16,725
Speaker 4:  You forgot one. I forgot one. There was also the music app, which was, I

876
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:20,325
Speaker 4:  forgot the music app. There was like 24 hours of excitement of people being

877
00:51:20,325 --> 00:51:23,285
Speaker 4:  like, oh my God, I keep hearing there's a Nintendo thing happening. This

878
00:51:23,285 --> 00:51:27,205
Speaker 4:  is gonna be it. This is it, this is it. I am in Slack with Andrew Webster

879
00:51:27,205 --> 00:51:29,325
Speaker 4:  being like, we have to have a plan. This is the biggest thing. And then they

880
00:51:29,325 --> 00:51:30,085
Speaker 4:  announced the music app.

881
00:51:30,685 --> 00:51:34,445
Speaker 6:  Some, some guy was like, I had had this leak that it was gonna be the Switch

882
00:51:34,445 --> 00:51:38,205
Speaker 6:  the next morning. And Andrew Webster, he was like, my heart can't take it.

883
00:51:38,205 --> 00:51:41,165
Speaker 6:  He, our games entered he, he was so ready to write about the switch too.

884
00:51:41,705 --> 00:51:45,405
Speaker 6:  And then the next morning the leak guy was like, I just got used by Nintendo

885
00:51:45,425 --> 00:51:46,205
Speaker 6:  so hard. It

886
00:51:46,265 --> 00:51:49,405
Speaker 4:  Is my favorite. I have come all the way around. I hope Nintendo does this

887
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:53,325
Speaker 4:  for five more years. Just don't, don't ever launch the new switch.

888
00:51:53,435 --> 00:51:57,045
Speaker 4:  Just keep doing silly stuff. There was also a museum launch in there somewhere.

889
00:51:57,225 --> 00:52:00,485
Speaker 4:  Andrew got an invite to go to Japan and it was about a museum and not the

890
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:03,685
Speaker 4:  Switch to like, it's so funny. This is the best. Do you

891
00:52:03,685 --> 00:52:06,285
Speaker 3:  Think they know that everyone's expecting the switch to, so every other team

892
00:52:06,285 --> 00:52:09,245
Speaker 3:  in Nintendo is like, let's do our announcement first. Pay attention

893
00:52:09,305 --> 00:52:11,765
Speaker 4:  To it. They have to. They have to know. And this is now the funniest bit

894
00:52:11,765 --> 00:52:15,285
Speaker 4:  from a tech company in a very long time and I love it so much.

895
00:52:16,385 --> 00:52:20,045
Speaker 4:  But this week we got actual switch news, not the switch news we were expecting

896
00:52:20,045 --> 00:52:22,045
Speaker 4:  but actual real switch news.

897
00:52:22,345 --> 00:52:25,165
Speaker 3:  But it was like, but and this wasn't an announcement, right? This is like,

898
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,445
Speaker 3:  this was like in a briefing, like buried information,

899
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:33,495
Speaker 6:  Right? I think it was like a financial briefing and then, and then Nintendo

900
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:36,815
Speaker 6:  was like, I guess nobody noticed so we'll we will tweet it now. And they

901
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:36,935
Speaker 6:  did

902
00:52:37,675 --> 00:52:41,375
Speaker 4:  On election night in the middle. Literally I'm sitting on my couch

903
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:45,335
Speaker 4:  talking to people during election night. We're we're tracking the returns

904
00:52:45,335 --> 00:52:49,135
Speaker 4:  as they come in and somebody just drops this tweet in Slack and is like,

905
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:51,895
Speaker 4:  did they just announce backwards compatibility for switch games,

906
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:55,575
Speaker 3:  Right. Can I read you this tweet? As rich cast listeners know,

907
00:52:56,655 --> 00:53:00,445
Speaker 3:  I like explaining how the journalism sausage is made. And this one is

908
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:04,125
Speaker 3:  particularly good because at 8:26 PM

909
00:53:04,225 --> 00:53:05,245
Speaker 3:  on November 5th,

910
00:53:06,785 --> 00:53:10,765
Speaker 3:  the Nintendo account just tweeted, this is for Alcala, which is the president

911
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:13,925
Speaker 3:  of Nintendo Chura for Alcala. But it just says this is for Alcala

912
00:53:14,385 --> 00:53:15,485
Speaker 3:  Badass, no other names.

913
00:53:15,705 --> 00:53:17,445
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna start all my tweets like that from now on.

914
00:53:17,635 --> 00:53:20,525
Speaker 3:  Does it not say I am the president of Nintendo? It just says this is for

915
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:21,765
Speaker 3:  Akwa. It's

916
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:22,885
Speaker 4:  Very good. You know who it is.

917
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:24,525
Speaker 3:  What time is it

918
00:53:27,145 --> 00:53:30,165
Speaker 3:  At today's corporate management policy briefing, we announced that Nintendo

919
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,845
Speaker 3:  Switch software will be playable and the Assessor Nintendo switch. What is

920
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:37,805
Speaker 3:  the corporate management policy briefing? They had an offsite,

921
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:40,765
Speaker 3:  that's, that's what I'm taking away from this. They had an offsite and they

922
00:53:40,765 --> 00:53:44,365
Speaker 3:  distributed some pamphlets and they're like, shit, this is gonna leak for

923
00:53:44,405 --> 00:53:45,565
Speaker 3:  a cow. Get on the horn.

924
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:49,445
Speaker 4:  It's either that or like an internal company newsletter that like only goes

925
00:53:49,445 --> 00:53:53,005
Speaker 4:  to the accounting department and they were like, ah. I hit all staff instead

926
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:55,485
Speaker 4:  of accounting, like I guess we'll just share this with everybody now.

927
00:53:56,505 --> 00:54:00,435
Speaker 3:  It's very good. I, from now on am signing every tweet from

928
00:54:00,435 --> 00:54:02,035
Speaker 3:  The Verge accounts. Is this is Patel.

929
00:54:05,465 --> 00:54:06,155
Speaker 3:  It's very good.

930
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:09,715
Speaker 4:  It is good. But wait, Sean, if I, if I understand the news correctly, basically

931
00:54:09,745 --> 00:54:13,435
Speaker 4:  what they announced is that whatever is coming after the Switch

932
00:54:13,785 --> 00:54:17,475
Speaker 4:  will be able to play switch games, which is a

933
00:54:17,575 --> 00:54:21,475
Speaker 4:  big and somewhat unusual deal for Nintendo. Is

934
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:22,435
Speaker 4:  that, do I basically have that right?

935
00:54:22,645 --> 00:54:26,155
Speaker 6:  Let's talk about the impact of this for a moment. So this could be one of

936
00:54:26,155 --> 00:54:29,995
Speaker 6:  two things. Let, let's go, let's go optimistic first. The Nintendo

937
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:33,675
Speaker 6:  switch, the original 2017 Nintendo Switch launched with like 12

938
00:54:33,675 --> 00:54:36,915
Speaker 6:  games, all of which were basically like Zelda and everything else.

939
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:41,995
Speaker 6:  We had a headline on The Verge, the Nintendo Switch launch games lineup is

940
00:54:41,995 --> 00:54:45,715
Speaker 6:  disappointing and needlessly confusing. That is where the switch

941
00:54:45,845 --> 00:54:49,795
Speaker 6:  began before it became the juggernaut that it is today, which has

942
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:53,395
Speaker 6:  one of the biggest libraries of any console ever released.

943
00:54:54,015 --> 00:54:57,795
Speaker 6:  It is amazing. And so that Switch two, having that lineup

944
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,995
Speaker 6:  on day one would be phenomenal.

945
00:55:02,095 --> 00:55:05,795
Speaker 6:  The thing is, we don't know if this means it will have a cartridge slot or

946
00:55:05,795 --> 00:55:08,755
Speaker 6:  not. Oh, interesting. So if it doesn't take the Switch

947
00:55:09,325 --> 00:55:09,995
Speaker 6:  cartridges,

948
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:14,915
Speaker 6:  then you're gonna have to own these games digitally or buy them again or

949
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:18,915
Speaker 6:  whatever you have to do there. And now we're back in The PS five Pro.

950
00:55:19,335 --> 00:55:22,875
Speaker 6:  Why don't they think we like physical media space? I don't know which it

951
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,275
Speaker 6:  is. They didn't say.

952
00:55:25,995 --> 00:55:28,635
Speaker 3:  I mean I'm at, I buy the games digitally 'cause I'm lazy,

953
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:32,675
Speaker 3:  right? Like Astro Bot is available,

954
00:55:33,535 --> 00:55:35,315
Speaker 3:  I'm just gonna download it.

955
00:55:35,705 --> 00:55:37,275
Speaker 6:  I've started doing that like

956
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:38,195
Speaker 3:  That. Yeah. See, see

957
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:41,915
Speaker 6:  At Luigi's Mansion, I got Echoes of wisdom digitally,

958
00:55:42,135 --> 00:55:43,555
Speaker 6:  but I have so many cartridges

959
00:55:43,815 --> 00:55:47,035
Speaker 3:  The Bluey game is on the switch at our house. 'cause

960
00:55:47,855 --> 00:55:51,595
Speaker 3:  no one was letting me drive to the store. I was like, here, now we're doing

961
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:55,435
Speaker 3:  this. Right. So, I, I, I think more regular

962
00:55:55,795 --> 00:55:58,595
Speaker 3:  consumers have these like hybrid libraries and I think it's important for

963
00:55:58,675 --> 00:56:00,995
Speaker 3:  'em to say like you can just keep using this library. 'cause once it's digital,

964
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:05,005
Speaker 3:  it's just there, right? I mean there's a million, and don't get me wrong,

965
00:56:05,005 --> 00:56:08,445
Speaker 3:  there's a million other problems with this, including preservation and emulation,

966
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:11,645
Speaker 3:  which we will talk about in a second. But I think from just a pure convenience

967
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:15,485
Speaker 3:  or your library will be here with your new switch, I think

968
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:18,605
Speaker 3:  it's starting to become an expectation. Just like absent an iPhone, our expectation

969
00:56:19,195 --> 00:56:21,805
Speaker 3:  like I bought all this stuff, I'm gonna get the new device, it's just gonna

970
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:22,085
Speaker 3:  be here.

971
00:56:22,485 --> 00:56:26,245
Speaker 6:  I want that so much and I want it to be portable and preservable

972
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:30,485
Speaker 6:  and it's nice, you know, it's nice when you fire up your PS five pro and

973
00:56:30,485 --> 00:56:33,765
Speaker 6:  you're like all these PS five games are there and all your PS four games

974
00:56:34,075 --> 00:56:37,565
Speaker 6:  that you've bought in your digital library. But it's what's extra nice when

975
00:56:37,565 --> 00:56:40,965
Speaker 6:  you can take all those discs that are on your shelf and also stick them in

976
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:43,045
Speaker 6:  there. Why not both? Hopefully both.

977
00:56:43,605 --> 00:56:47,125
Speaker 3:  I mean it's Nintendo, they're gonna do some weird stuff. That's you, you

978
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:48,685
Speaker 3:  know, it's true. No matter what here, the Switch,

979
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:53,055
Speaker 4:  Historically speaking, Nintendo has kind of gone on both sides of this, right?

980
00:56:53,055 --> 00:56:56,935
Speaker 4:  Like if I remember like the, we you played most or

981
00:56:57,075 --> 00:57:00,555
Speaker 4:  at least some we games, but then like you're talking about complete break

982
00:57:00,575 --> 00:57:01,195
Speaker 4:  to the switch,

983
00:57:02,865 --> 00:57:06,315
Speaker 4:  like yeah, just, and like, you know, you go all the way back and like the

984
00:57:06,355 --> 00:57:10,195
Speaker 4:  N 64 was very much its own thing. It's not like those giant ass cartridges

985
00:57:10,195 --> 00:57:13,035
Speaker 4:  went on to the next thing. So I guess it, it would be hard to

986
00:57:14,695 --> 00:57:17,235
Speaker 4:  put odds against what it seems like Nintendo might actually do here.

987
00:57:17,425 --> 00:57:21,035
Speaker 6:  Yeah, like the, the portables, it's been pretty good in the portable space.

988
00:57:21,065 --> 00:57:25,035
Speaker 6:  Like If, you bought a Nintendo DS Light, you

989
00:57:25,035 --> 00:57:28,635
Speaker 6:  could play DS games on that. You could also play Game Boy Advance Games on

990
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:32,555
Speaker 6:  that, which was basically an entirely different system. You couldn't put

991
00:57:32,915 --> 00:57:36,475
Speaker 6:  original Game Boy cartridges in there or Game Boy color cartridges. But you

992
00:57:36,475 --> 00:57:39,195
Speaker 6:  go back a generation before that, the Game Boy Advance, you could put Game

993
00:57:39,195 --> 00:57:42,035
Speaker 6:  Boy, advance Games, game Boy Color Games, original Game Boy games into that.

994
00:57:42,035 --> 00:57:45,475
Speaker 6:  They would all work. You go up to the DSI, all of a sudden you've got just

995
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:49,275
Speaker 6:  DSI and Ds. You don't get Game Boy anymore. So they, they kinda like, they

996
00:57:49,275 --> 00:57:53,035
Speaker 6:  try to do like one to two generations usually of backwards combat. And then

997
00:57:53,395 --> 00:57:56,715
Speaker 6:  occasionally, like you said with this N 64, they're just, we're done. But

998
00:57:56,715 --> 00:58:00,355
Speaker 6:  even like the Game Cube, you could stick a Game Boy player onto the bottom

999
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:04,315
Speaker 6:  of that and stick your cartridges in. So maybe there'll be some offbeat solution

1000
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:07,835
Speaker 4:  That's the most Nintendo possible outcome here where they're like, well here's

1001
00:58:07,835 --> 00:58:10,955
Speaker 4:  the thing, but we'll also sell you this weird arm attachment that lets you

1002
00:58:11,345 --> 00:58:13,915
Speaker 4:  play all of your other games. It's made of card for, did

1003
00:58:13,915 --> 00:58:16,475
Speaker 3:  You ever have the Nintendo robot for the Nest? This just made me think about

1004
00:58:16,475 --> 00:58:20,195
Speaker 3:  the original Nintendo robot. No, they made a robot and it pushed the

1005
00:58:20,195 --> 00:58:23,955
Speaker 3:  buttons on the, it was really should go look it up. It was, yeah, it was

1006
00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:28,115
Speaker 3:  ridiculous. I wanted ones, I wanted one so bad and I finally got

1007
00:58:28,115 --> 00:58:31,915
Speaker 3:  one and it was so disappointing. Like, so deeply

1008
00:58:31,915 --> 00:58:35,715
Speaker 3:  disappointing. Shocked, shocked. We are talking about emulation,

1009
00:58:35,715 --> 00:58:38,675
Speaker 3:  we're talking about this stuff. Sean, we should end by talking about your

1010
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:39,035
Speaker 3:  story

1011
00:58:40,775 --> 00:58:44,515
Speaker 3:  you wrote about Nintendo going after YouTubers who are

1012
00:58:44,905 --> 00:58:47,795
Speaker 3:  streaming games, talking about game preservation. There's a lot of action

1013
00:58:47,855 --> 00:58:51,475
Speaker 3:  in this front lately, and that's all right next to, I dunno,

1014
00:58:51,755 --> 00:58:55,555
Speaker 3:  companies like Amick, which are just selling hardware emulators free

1015
00:58:55,555 --> 00:58:59,035
Speaker 3:  and clear on Amazon with apparently no repercussions. Talk about this story

1016
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,395
Speaker 3:  then. Let's talk about that bigger picture. What is going on with Nintendo

1017
00:59:01,395 --> 00:59:02,195
Speaker 3:  on YouTube right now?

1018
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:06,155
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so Nintendo and I, I've written one story, but there's, there's more

1019
00:59:06,155 --> 00:59:09,755
Speaker 6:  in the works. I think Nintendo seems to have decided

1020
00:59:09,935 --> 00:59:13,195
Speaker 6:  it wants to make an example out of one

1021
00:59:13,285 --> 00:59:17,275
Speaker 6:  particular YouTuber. And it may be targeting others

1022
00:59:17,695 --> 00:59:21,445
Speaker 6:  as well, though we think there may be a copyright troll

1023
00:59:21,505 --> 00:59:25,325
Speaker 6:  on the loose and that's what a future story is gonna get into. But

1024
00:59:25,325 --> 00:59:29,245
Speaker 6:  this, this one guy is named Russ Crandall. He runs

1025
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:33,365
Speaker 6:  a a, a YouTube channel called Retro Game Core. And

1026
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:37,005
Speaker 6:  the weird thing about Nintendo targeting him is that he is known

1027
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:41,165
Speaker 6:  for advocating against piracy. He shows up all kinds of

1028
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:44,765
Speaker 6:  like genuine switch cartridges in his videos to show you that he's not just

1029
00:59:44,765 --> 00:59:48,405
Speaker 6:  like ripping games off the internet, although he, yeah, maybe he does some

1030
00:59:48,405 --> 00:59:52,245
Speaker 6:  of that on the side, but he wants you to know that

1031
00:59:52,245 --> 00:59:56,205
Speaker 6:  you can do this somewhat legally or so He says, by

1032
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:59,965
Speaker 6:  making your own backups of your games, putting them onto

1033
01:00:00,415 --> 01:00:04,205
Speaker 6:  flashcards, If you want to, and then taking around your entire library of

1034
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:07,725
Speaker 6:  switch games with you that you have on genuine cartridges. This is possible

1035
01:00:07,725 --> 01:00:11,605
Speaker 6:  now through a particular device that Nintendo really does not want the

1036
01:00:11,605 --> 01:00:15,485
Speaker 6:  world to know about. And so in a, in a new example of the

1037
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:19,045
Speaker 6:  Streisand effect, they decided to target this guy.

1038
01:00:20,945 --> 01:00:24,925
Speaker 6:  He is not somebody you would necessarily want to target if

1039
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:27,925
Speaker 6:  you're Nintendo though, because he's a very

1040
01:00:28,685 --> 01:00:32,565
Speaker 6:  interesting and likable person, I would say, who has, who

1041
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:36,445
Speaker 6:  has a, an audience that understands him as an

1042
01:00:36,885 --> 01:00:40,245
Speaker 6:  educator who like teaches them how to use things rather than boasting about

1043
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:43,725
Speaker 6:  how he pirates stuff. He also happens to be a New York Times bestselling

1044
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:46,765
Speaker 6:  cookbook author, A 22 Veteran of the US Navy

1045
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:51,005
Speaker 6:  and all kinds of other things that, yeah, you can read about my whole story.

1046
01:00:51,395 --> 01:00:51,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

1047
01:00:51,835 --> 01:00:55,085
Speaker 4:  It's a good story. But I, it does seem like if you're

1048
01:00:55,565 --> 01:00:59,045
Speaker 4:  Nintendo and you wanna go like full scorched earth on

1049
01:01:00,315 --> 01:01:03,965
Speaker 4:  this kind of thing on the internet, like you can, you can use

1050
01:01:04,635 --> 01:01:08,565
Speaker 4:  copyright to pick that fight, but that doesn't seem like

1051
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:12,525
Speaker 4:  what Nintendo is doing here. It has instead picked

1052
01:01:12,885 --> 01:01:16,805
Speaker 4:  a small series of very specific fights with

1053
01:01:16,805 --> 01:01:20,725
Speaker 4:  a couple of emulators and now with this one YouTuber, it's not

1054
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:23,405
Speaker 4:  like the stories we've heard over the years about you, you know, companies

1055
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:27,245
Speaker 4:  that just go and issue mass copyright strikes for everyone using

1056
01:01:27,245 --> 01:01:30,285
Speaker 4:  footage of any of their stuff, which is a thing that has happened a few times

1057
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:34,205
Speaker 4:  on YouTube over the years. That's not what Nintendo is doing here. And I,

1058
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:37,005
Speaker 4:  it, and I, it's hard for me to figure out what it is doing.

1059
01:01:38,045 --> 01:01:40,845
Speaker 6:  I wanna say that the common theme here is

1060
01:01:41,485 --> 01:01:45,445
Speaker 6:  Nintendo is just ridiculously less tolerant

1061
01:01:46,105 --> 01:01:49,845
Speaker 6:  of people cutting into its current gen console

1062
01:01:50,155 --> 01:01:54,005
Speaker 6:  profits. You wanna talk about old games, you wanna talk about, you know,

1063
01:01:54,025 --> 01:01:57,885
Speaker 6:  you want, you wanna play show off emulators with Game Boy games or SNES games

1064
01:01:57,885 --> 01:02:01,085
Speaker 6:  or N 64 games. You wanna build emulators for those things.

1065
01:02:01,415 --> 01:02:05,325
Speaker 6:  Nintendo's generally gonna leave you alone. But once it's started,

1066
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:09,645
Speaker 6:  once we started seeing not only Nintendo Switch emulators and

1067
01:02:09,645 --> 01:02:13,005
Speaker 6:  Nintendo switch games all over YouTube playing on Nintendo Switch emulators,

1068
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:17,405
Speaker 6:  but the very latest games, the Zelda that's going

1069
01:02:17,405 --> 01:02:21,125
Speaker 6:  to come out this week or just has come out this week here it is

1070
01:02:21,395 --> 01:02:25,245
Speaker 6:  running in, you know, at a high resolution on a pc.

1071
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:29,205
Speaker 6:  Look how much better it looks than it looks on the actual switch

1072
01:02:29,525 --> 01:02:33,285
Speaker 6:  hardware. Hmm. Maybe you should be playing it here on a PC instead.

1073
01:02:33,385 --> 01:02:35,805
Speaker 6:  Or maybe you should take your whole library of switch games and play them

1074
01:02:35,805 --> 01:02:39,645
Speaker 6:  on a steam deck, which is not only looks better than it does

1075
01:02:39,645 --> 01:02:43,125
Speaker 6:  on the switch, but is portable like a Nintendo switch? Is the steam deck

1076
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:46,285
Speaker 6:  better than a Nintendo Switch? Wouldn't want people to walk away with that

1077
01:02:46,315 --> 01:02:50,125
Speaker 6:  idea in their heads. This is where Nintendo started stepping

1078
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:53,885
Speaker 6:  in. And so we saw a while back before,

1079
01:02:53,885 --> 01:02:57,685
Speaker 6:  before, before it fought against Yuzu and Rio Jinx

1080
01:02:57,685 --> 01:03:01,445
Speaker 6:  the two big switch emulators before it did that. There was a while,

1081
01:03:01,805 --> 01:03:05,725
Speaker 6:  I wanna say maybe about a year ago, where a bunch of folks showing

1082
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:09,125
Speaker 6:  off switch games on Steam Deck started getting

1083
01:03:09,705 --> 01:03:13,125
Speaker 6:  little notices from Nintendo that maybe they might not want to do that. And

1084
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:16,965
Speaker 6:  some of the, some of the folks who were, you know, the,

1085
01:03:16,965 --> 01:03:20,885
Speaker 6:  the YouTubers who were more wanted to stay on Nintendo's good Grace, it just

1086
01:03:20,885 --> 01:03:24,605
Speaker 6:  went ahead and voluntarily started making some of those disappear. But they

1087
01:03:24,605 --> 01:03:28,485
Speaker 6:  told other creators in their sphere, Hmm, Nintendo

1088
01:03:28,485 --> 01:03:31,565
Speaker 6:  did this thing to me and Word got around that this was happening. I think

1089
01:03:31,805 --> 01:03:35,325
Speaker 6:  Linus Tech Tips did a video at one point where they were like, we're going

1090
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:39,285
Speaker 6:  to call out this trend and here we're gonna, we're gonna blur out all of

1091
01:03:39,285 --> 01:03:41,805
Speaker 6:  our footage of switch games. We're gonna be like, Hey look, you know, look

1092
01:03:41,805 --> 01:03:44,525
Speaker 6:  what we can do in Nintendo. You're not gonna go after us. Right? And I don't

1093
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:48,165
Speaker 6:  think they did, but After that kept

1094
01:03:48,385 --> 01:03:52,125
Speaker 6:  on a pace on YouTube and we kept seeing more and more,

1095
01:03:52,385 --> 01:03:55,685
Speaker 6:  here's how you emulate your switch games on Steam Deck. Nintendo went after

1096
01:03:55,685 --> 01:03:59,205
Speaker 6:  the emulators, the software that's making all of that

1097
01:03:59,645 --> 01:04:02,715
Speaker 6:  possible. And Yuzu was the biggest emulator

1098
01:04:03,815 --> 01:04:07,635
Speaker 6:  and there were whispers in the community that they were testing

1099
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:12,155
Speaker 6:  their emulator on games that had leaked out early

1100
01:04:12,325 --> 01:04:15,515
Speaker 6:  games that were not even out yet. A new, a new Zelda

1101
01:04:16,245 --> 01:04:20,235
Speaker 6:  Tears to the Kingdom, allegedly they had it and were making sure

1102
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:23,395
Speaker 6:  the game was ready for it before it launched at retail.

1103
01:04:24,215 --> 01:04:28,155
Speaker 6:  And so that regardless of whether, you know, Nintendo could pin them,

1104
01:04:28,305 --> 01:04:31,675
Speaker 6:  that on them or not seems to have

1105
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:35,955
Speaker 6:  inflamed Nintendo's fury for to, to go after them

1106
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:39,875
Speaker 6:  legally. And so Yuzu went

1107
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:43,675
Speaker 6:  down, Rio Jinx went down. There are lots of forks of these

1108
01:04:43,835 --> 01:04:47,755
Speaker 6:  emulators floating about the internet, but they are more in

1109
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:51,515
Speaker 6:  the, in the, in the, in the, in the dark re regions of the space. Now

1110
01:04:51,865 --> 01:04:55,035
Speaker 6:  they've slunk back into the shadows for the most part. They're trying to

1111
01:04:55,035 --> 01:04:56,355
Speaker 6:  keep a way lower profile.

1112
01:04:56,825 --> 01:05:00,715
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's funny, one of, you know, a a VERGE trope, a thing The

1113
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:04,155
Speaker 3:  Verge believes is that copyright law is the only law on the internet, especially

1114
01:05:04,155 --> 01:05:07,755
Speaker 3:  when you have a platform, because it's the one law everyone agrees

1115
01:05:08,215 --> 01:05:12,125
Speaker 3:  can restrict speech. And so you've got a process on YouTube where a

1116
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:15,325
Speaker 3:  big company can can just say like, remove this speech

1117
01:05:15,905 --> 01:05:19,765
Speaker 3:  and you can fight it. It sounds like from your story, Crandall Retro Games

1118
01:05:19,945 --> 01:05:23,085
Speaker 3:  is gonna go fight it, but it's expensive and hard.

1119
01:05:23,805 --> 01:05:27,245
Speaker 6:  Actually, I, I think, I think he's not, I don't think he's gonna fight it.

1120
01:05:27,245 --> 01:05:27,925
Speaker 3:  He's not going to,

1121
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:32,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah, we, we started out in my story, I say that he's waffling

1122
01:05:32,545 --> 01:05:36,445
Speaker 6:  and as of my last communication with him, he was waffling,

1123
01:05:36,825 --> 01:05:40,805
Speaker 6:  but I re I rewrote this draft a few different times. Originally when I

1124
01:05:40,805 --> 01:05:44,125
Speaker 6:  spoke to him, he said he was 70%, 5% likely to fight this.

1125
01:05:44,585 --> 01:05:48,085
Speaker 6:  He talked to, he talked to lawyers like, yeah, I've got a fair use case.

1126
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:53,005
Speaker 6:  I don't think he wanted to go to court over it, but he can at

1127
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:56,765
Speaker 6:  least submit the counter notice to the

1128
01:05:56,805 --> 01:06:00,765
Speaker 6:  DMCA takedown, which lets YouTube off the hook and then, you know, puts the,

1129
01:06:00,995 --> 01:06:04,685
Speaker 6:  puts the spotlight on him and then wait and see if Nintendo sends him

1130
01:06:05,285 --> 01:06:09,165
Speaker 6:  a cease and desist or goes ahead with a lawsuit. He was in that place where

1131
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:13,005
Speaker 6:  he was like, maybe I'll try my like 75% likely. I was talking to him

1132
01:06:13,005 --> 01:06:16,085
Speaker 6:  later and he is like, well maybe it's 50 50.

1133
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:21,125
Speaker 3:  I mean it's expensive and complicated. Yeah, right. And you gotta, you gotta

1134
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:24,005
Speaker 3:  be buttoned up. I mean this is a thing we talk about with independent creators

1135
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,565
Speaker 3:  all the time, go be successful. But then there's a whole

1136
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:31,205
Speaker 3:  universe of infrastructure that you don't have. 'cause you don't have like

1137
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:35,005
Speaker 3:  a media company. Like we have lawyers, like we get letters like

1138
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:38,805
Speaker 3:  this all day long and I'm just like, cool, our lawyers will see you

1139
01:06:38,805 --> 01:06:41,645
Speaker 3:  now. And then our lawyer's like, Howard, do you wanna fight? I'm like, fight

1140
01:06:41,645 --> 01:06:45,485
Speaker 3:  all the way because you know, you get to say that sometimes

1141
01:06:46,465 --> 01:06:49,885
Speaker 3:  and that's fine, right? Like that's the infrastructure of having a big company

1142
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:52,965
Speaker 3:  around and like having a reputation and like a lot of the lawyers on the

1143
01:06:52,965 --> 01:06:56,565
Speaker 3:  other side are repeat players. So now everybody has relationships, solo creators

1144
01:06:56,665 --> 01:07:00,205
Speaker 3:  on platforms are just sort of at the mercy of whoever wants to go after them,

1145
01:07:00,205 --> 01:07:03,965
Speaker 3:  including Nintendo. And then they have to make big meaningful

1146
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:07,235
Speaker 3:  decisions about whether they wanna like fight for

1147
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:12,115
Speaker 3:  emulation software being displayed on screen is fair use. Like this is very

1148
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:12,555
Speaker 3:  confusing.

1149
01:07:12,555 --> 01:07:15,475
Speaker 4:  Well, and this is what the emulators themselves have gone through too. The

1150
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:19,195
Speaker 4:  question of like, yeah, even if we think we're right and we would win at

1151
01:07:19,195 --> 01:07:23,075
Speaker 4:  the end, can we literally afford the fight?

1152
01:07:23,535 --> 01:07:26,515
Speaker 4:  And I think the, the bet a lot of companies make, not just Nintendo, but

1153
01:07:26,535 --> 01:07:30,155
Speaker 4:  one of the bets it seems like Nintendo is making and has been right so far,

1154
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:32,875
Speaker 4:  is that the emulators are going to decide they can't afford the fight,

1155
01:07:33,285 --> 01:07:37,195
Speaker 6:  Right? I talked to a lot of emulator developers for a previous

1156
01:07:37,195 --> 01:07:40,635
Speaker 6:  story about what happened to Yuzu and what was happening to Vu Jinx.

1157
01:07:41,055 --> 01:07:44,715
Speaker 6:  And every one of them told me no I would have to roll over if

1158
01:07:44,715 --> 01:07:48,475
Speaker 6:  Nintendo came after me because there's no way in hell I'd

1159
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:50,795
Speaker 6:  have the the resources to fight anything.

1160
01:07:51,255 --> 01:07:55,225
Speaker 3:  Or, and, and honestly litigation is exhausting,

1161
01:07:56,025 --> 01:07:58,975
Speaker 3:  right? Like, Nintendo's gonna, you, you fine, I'm gonna fight, I'm gonna

1162
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:01,135
Speaker 3:  spend the money, I'm gonna hire the lawyers. Nintendo's gonna come a after

1163
01:08:01,135 --> 01:08:04,855
Speaker 3:  you and say, give me every piece of

1164
01:08:04,865 --> 01:08:08,495
Speaker 3:  email that has ever mentioned anyone involved in the development of this

1165
01:08:08,655 --> 01:08:12,495
Speaker 3:  emulator. Show me your, all of your history, your dms on

1166
01:08:12,495 --> 01:08:15,805
Speaker 3:  GitHub. Like whatever it is. Like, I don't know if GitHub has tms, but you

1167
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:19,125
Speaker 3:  understand what like, show me like involve all of these other people

1168
01:08:19,755 --> 01:08:22,765
Speaker 3:  because these are all, almost all volunteer projects in one way or another

1169
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,245
Speaker 3:  with lots of different contributors. And it's like, oh, this is gonna be

1170
01:08:25,245 --> 01:08:28,815
Speaker 3:  exhausting and not everyone's gonna play ball. And it's all like, yeah, I,

1171
01:08:28,895 --> 01:08:31,335
Speaker 3:  I feel for these communities when they come up against this stuff. But it's

1172
01:08:31,335 --> 01:08:35,255
Speaker 3:  also just very true that the only mechanism we have

1173
01:08:35,255 --> 01:08:38,895
Speaker 3:  in the United States to to handle anything is copyright law. And copyright

1174
01:08:38,895 --> 01:08:42,655
Speaker 3:  law is like the Bluntest instrument and you know, YouTube's approach to

1175
01:08:43,405 --> 01:08:46,855
Speaker 3:  copyright, right? Like you get three and you're dead. Like that's it.

1176
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:49,855
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think a lot of people need to know, like they, a lot of people don't

1177
01:08:49,855 --> 01:08:53,815
Speaker 6:  know. Nintendo does not serve you with a

1178
01:08:53,815 --> 01:08:57,655
Speaker 6:  copyright strike. The copyright strike is a YouTube platform

1179
01:08:57,655 --> 01:09:01,175
Speaker 6:  feature where YouTube can make it easier

1180
01:09:01,435 --> 01:09:05,255
Speaker 6:  on themselves so that they don't have to face down any

1181
01:09:05,255 --> 01:09:08,775
Speaker 6:  lawsuits from Nintendo. They can say, Hey creators,

1182
01:09:09,305 --> 01:09:13,095
Speaker 6:  we're going to make this three strikes and you're out rule so that you

1183
01:09:13,095 --> 01:09:16,935
Speaker 6:  police yourselves that way we don't need to get involved very often. We'll

1184
01:09:17,095 --> 01:09:20,855
Speaker 6:  automate it as much as we can come to us if there's a problem.

1185
01:09:21,195 --> 01:09:25,095
Speaker 6:  And maybe we'll reach out to Nintendo on your behalf like they did in this

1186
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:29,055
Speaker 6:  case. YouTube did reach out to Nintendo according

1187
01:09:29,055 --> 01:09:32,815
Speaker 6:  to, according to Russ Crall and to see if they would

1188
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:37,055
Speaker 6:  pull their strike willingly once they knew who Russ was and what kind,

1189
01:09:37,055 --> 01:09:40,095
Speaker 6:  what Russ stood for. And Nten was like, no, we're not gonna, we're not gonna

1190
01:09:40,095 --> 01:09:40,295
Speaker 6:  pull

1191
01:09:40,645 --> 01:09:43,615
Speaker 3:  This. That sounds about right. By the way, that entire system is called Notice

1192
01:09:43,615 --> 01:09:46,615
Speaker 3:  and takedown. It's in the digital Millennium Copyright Act in every platform

1193
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:49,575
Speaker 3:  has it. YouTube just has one expression of it. And

1194
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:53,535
Speaker 3:  YouTubers running into that stuff when they make the video about it is like

1195
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:57,295
Speaker 3:  when they, when they get their wings, like right, more

1196
01:09:57,295 --> 01:10:00,055
Speaker 3:  people are familiar with copyright law because if YouTubers complaining about

1197
01:10:00,055 --> 01:10:03,175
Speaker 3:  copyright law then like no the speed limits in their own towns. And this

1198
01:10:03,175 --> 01:10:06,895
Speaker 3:  is all just a thing. Anyhow, it's fascinating Sean,

1199
01:10:07,015 --> 01:10:10,135
Speaker 3:  you're gonna be writing about this more. 'cause it feels like emulation is

1200
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,135
Speaker 3:  a real crossroads.

1201
01:10:11,635 --> 01:10:15,495
Speaker 6:  It really is. While I cannot personally write

1202
01:10:15,495 --> 01:10:18,975
Speaker 6:  about the Apple aspect of it, it is fascinating,

1203
01:10:19,045 --> 01:10:22,735
Speaker 6:  utterly fascinating that this was the year that that

1204
01:10:22,865 --> 01:10:26,575
Speaker 6:  Apple said, Hey, you can go ahead and put Retro

1205
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:29,935
Speaker 6:  Game emulators on our iPhone platform.

1206
01:12:16,385 --> 01:12:19,565
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back with the lightning round unsponsored, although

1207
01:12:20,115 --> 01:12:21,465
Speaker 3:  there might be some news on this front.

1208
01:12:23,395 --> 01:12:27,255
Speaker 3:  You can sponsor David's mobile repair van David

1209
01:12:27,255 --> 01:12:29,935
Speaker 3:  will come to your house and take any iMac you have and turn it into

1210
01:12:29,935 --> 01:12:33,335
Speaker 4:  A monitor. David's iMac mobile is still very much up for sponsorship.

1211
01:12:35,415 --> 01:12:38,335
Speaker 3:  Have you seen the little board? I think Wes Davis heard about it. There's

1212
01:12:38,335 --> 01:12:42,135
Speaker 3:  a little board that lets you turn the Sunflower iMac G four into yes, a monitor.

1213
01:12:43,035 --> 01:12:45,575
Speaker 3:  And he has, he has, he did it to his like 20-year-old. Im actually four.

1214
01:12:45,575 --> 01:12:49,455
Speaker 3:  And I immediately went on eBay and looked at 20 inch. I'm actually four,

1215
01:12:49,585 --> 01:12:52,975
Speaker 3:  which are 20 years old. And they are so expensive. Really?

1216
01:12:53,405 --> 01:12:54,775
Speaker 3:  They're crazy expensive.

1217
01:12:54,855 --> 01:12:58,335
Speaker 4:  I mean they're just like beautiful furniture. They're they're, they're one

1218
01:12:58,335 --> 01:13:02,175
Speaker 4:  of the only gadgets that old that I would happily just like put up

1219
01:13:02,175 --> 01:13:03,815
Speaker 4:  on that mantle behind me. Yeah,

1220
01:13:04,245 --> 01:13:07,375
Speaker 3:  Well I think you gotta, we will link Wes right up, but he was like, why did

1221
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:11,215
Speaker 3:  I do this? 'cause it looks awesome. Yeah, it's good enough, but you can just,

1222
01:13:11,215 --> 01:13:15,095
Speaker 3:  it's just an honor. It's great. All right, lightning round. We promised some

1223
01:13:15,115 --> 01:13:18,955
Speaker 3:  hot domain name chat, David, what she got.

1224
01:13:19,255 --> 01:13:20,755
Speaker 4:  I'm so excited about this. So

1225
01:13:22,495 --> 01:13:25,715
Speaker 4:  the other day, this week, Sam Altman just tweets

1226
01:13:26,385 --> 01:13:30,235
Speaker 4:  chat.com and you click on it and it goes to chat GPT.

1227
01:13:31,255 --> 01:13:34,835
Speaker 4:  It turns out there is a whole fascinating story behind the fact that If,

1228
01:13:34,835 --> 01:13:38,675
Speaker 4:  you go to chat.com, it leads you to chat GPT and the,

1229
01:13:38,695 --> 01:13:42,515
Speaker 4:  the story in a nutshell is Dharmesh Shah, who is the

1230
01:13:42,595 --> 01:13:45,835
Speaker 4:  CTO of HubSpot, bought chat.com

1231
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:50,435
Speaker 4:  for $15 million, 15 and a half million dollars like

1232
01:13:50,705 --> 01:13:54,635
Speaker 4:  last year. And then two months later sold it for, we

1233
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:57,515
Speaker 4:  don't know exactly how much, but he said a profit and enough of a profit

1234
01:13:57,515 --> 01:14:00,395
Speaker 4:  that he was able to give $250,000 of profit away

1235
01:14:01,825 --> 01:14:05,725
Speaker 4:  due with that, which you will, my guess is it was substantially

1236
01:14:05,725 --> 01:14:09,365
Speaker 4:  higher than 15 and a half million dollars. I cannot prove that. But based

1237
01:14:09,365 --> 01:14:12,645
Speaker 4:  on what I know about domains and the fact that chat.com would be

1238
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:16,645
Speaker 4:  very highly in demand to a large number of people,

1239
01:14:17,765 --> 01:14:21,005
Speaker 4:  I suspect that was very expensive and that he made a tidy sum of money in

1240
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:24,525
Speaker 4:  two months on his 15 and a half million dollars domain name purchase.

1241
01:14:25,025 --> 01:14:28,925
Speaker 4:  Anyway, it is now the domain name that

1242
01:14:28,925 --> 01:14:32,845
Speaker 4:  leads you to chat GPT. Just to clear up a thing that has gotten

1243
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:36,765
Speaker 4:  very confusing on the internet chat. GPT, not rebranded, still

1244
01:14:36,765 --> 01:14:40,685
Speaker 4:  called chat. GPT Still a thing a lot of people know, I

1245
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:44,165
Speaker 4:  still hate the fact that GPT is like a term that has entered the

1246
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:47,525
Speaker 4:  public lexicon that we all just say now. Hate that,

1247
01:14:48,305 --> 01:14:52,205
Speaker 4:  but it's still called chat GPT. But chat.com now goes there

1248
01:14:52,205 --> 01:14:56,165
Speaker 4:  and I think that is going to be the kind of product domain

1249
01:14:56,585 --> 01:15:00,525
Speaker 4:  for that thing going forward, which is fascinating in a bunch

1250
01:15:00,525 --> 01:15:04,405
Speaker 4:  of different directions. It says something about how important websites still

1251
01:15:04,425 --> 01:15:08,285
Speaker 4:  are in the world. It says something about how important.com domains

1252
01:15:08,285 --> 01:15:12,085
Speaker 4:  still are in the world. It says something about why OpenAI

1253
01:15:12,085 --> 01:15:15,325
Speaker 4:  raised six and a half billion dollars. 'cause domain names are expensive.

1254
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:19,645
Speaker 4:  Like it's just, there's just a lot going on in this one purchase. But

1255
01:15:19,885 --> 01:15:22,525
Speaker 4:  this all happened about a year ago and it just rolled out this week. And

1256
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:27,125
Speaker 4:  I think is is now going to be one of the

1257
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:29,565
Speaker 4:  bigger domain names for a pretty long time.

1258
01:15:29,945 --> 01:15:33,405
Speaker 3:  It does seem like Dharmesh also got shares of OpenAI, which is fascinating

1259
01:15:33,405 --> 01:15:35,565
Speaker 3:  because, oh, interesting because it's not a public company, but it's about

1260
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:39,325
Speaker 3:  to become a for-profit public company. There's a lot here. He should read

1261
01:15:39,325 --> 01:15:42,205
Speaker 3:  it. He put, he put up a tweet being like, it's, it's everything. Here's the

1262
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:45,765
Speaker 3:  whole thing. And then he, and then there's a long prompt for chat GBT

1263
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:50,125
Speaker 3:  that helps you. He is like it, it's a prompt that GBT oh one does a really

1264
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:53,765
Speaker 3:  good job of reasoning through. And that ends with how much do you think he

1265
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:57,445
Speaker 3:  sold the chat.com domain for what percent of that was in shares of

1266
01:15:57,465 --> 01:16:00,725
Speaker 3:  OpenAI provide an approximate range and show reasoning, but he doesn't show

1267
01:16:00,725 --> 01:16:04,165
Speaker 3:  the answer so it can just hallucinate whatever you want.

1268
01:16:05,555 --> 01:16:06,205
Speaker 3:  It's very good.

1269
01:16:08,225 --> 01:16:12,205
Speaker 3:  So I mean that's wild all the way around. It's not

1270
01:16:12,205 --> 01:16:15,725
Speaker 3:  like chat GBT the most successful consumer product in a long time

1271
01:16:16,065 --> 01:16:19,085
Speaker 3:  was struggling for with brand recognition. It is also now

1272
01:16:19,815 --> 01:16:23,765
Speaker 3:  baked into iPhones or will soon be baked into iPhones. So the idea that they

1273
01:16:23,765 --> 01:16:27,355
Speaker 3:  need a domain name is just like pure vanity. It feels like, like they have

1274
01:16:27,355 --> 01:16:30,955
Speaker 3:  the distribution that they want, but it does seem like as they go towards

1275
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:34,955
Speaker 3:  being this new kind of for-profit company that they're going to,

1276
01:16:35,265 --> 01:16:38,915
Speaker 3:  they're just gonna become more consumer friendly in a variety of different

1277
01:16:38,915 --> 01:16:39,075
Speaker 3:  ways.

1278
01:16:39,145 --> 01:16:41,835
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean I've, I've been saying this on this show for a while now, but

1279
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:45,555
Speaker 4:  I think the, the thing that is happening right now is that

1280
01:16:45,895 --> 01:16:49,835
Speaker 4:  OpenAI is being lapped as a product organization by a lot of other folks.

1281
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:53,435
Speaker 4:  Like Apple is building better products around chat GPC right now

1282
01:16:53,785 --> 01:16:54,075
Speaker 4:  than

1283
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,995
Speaker 3:  OpenAI. Let's not be So you sound

1284
01:16:56,995 --> 01:17:00,675
Speaker 4:  Drunk. That's what I'm, that is the lowest bar in history

1285
01:17:01,095 --> 01:17:04,875
Speaker 4:  and it's still the case. Like this is, this is where we are and I think

1286
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:07,995
Speaker 3:  Gimme one example of Apple building a better product around CHE V than

1287
01:17:08,345 --> 01:17:11,725
Speaker 4:  That. It's easier to get to chat GPT on on iPhone,

1288
01:17:11,725 --> 01:17:13,925
Speaker 3:  But that's just a pure distribution advantage that

1289
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:17,885
Speaker 4:  That, but that's my point, right? I like the, the better example is Google

1290
01:17:17,945 --> 01:17:20,285
Speaker 4:  is doing much more interesting stuff on top of Gemini

1291
01:17:20,705 --> 01:17:22,885
Speaker 3:  If. you had said that first I wouldn't have accused you of drinking on the

1292
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:23,365
Speaker 3:  job, David,

1293
01:17:23,475 --> 01:17:26,925
Speaker 4:  This is why you gotta lead with the hot take and then pull it back. This

1294
01:17:26,925 --> 01:17:30,765
Speaker 4:  is, this is what we do here. No, but I I think the actual real example is

1295
01:17:30,765 --> 01:17:33,525
Speaker 4:  Anthropic and Claude. Yeah. Anthropic is just building

1296
01:17:34,385 --> 01:17:37,605
Speaker 4:  vastly better consumer products on top of Claude

1297
01:17:38,115 --> 01:17:41,565
Speaker 4:  more quickly than OpenAI, even though OpenAI typically has been first to

1298
01:17:41,605 --> 01:17:44,805
Speaker 4:  a lot of the underlying technology. But you're starting to see this shift

1299
01:17:44,815 --> 01:17:48,645
Speaker 4:  where, like you said, chat.com becomes just a more

1300
01:17:48,645 --> 01:17:52,085
Speaker 4:  understandable way to get to this thing than anything else. Like

1301
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:55,765
Speaker 4:  one thing somebody said to me a long time ago was that just being able to

1302
01:17:56,025 --> 01:17:59,885
Speaker 4:  put a simple domain name on a billboard goes a really long

1303
01:17:59,885 --> 01:18:03,845
Speaker 4:  way. Like just, just to be able to, just like you can imagine the

1304
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,365
Speaker 4:  billboard, right? That it's just like a pure white billboard and it just

1305
01:18:06,365 --> 01:18:09,365
Speaker 4:  says chat.com on it. Like that's powerful in a way that like

1306
01:18:09,465 --> 01:18:12,845
Speaker 4:  openai.com/chat gpt is not powerful. And

1307
01:18:13,275 --> 01:18:16,005
Speaker 4:  there's just a bunch of little things like that. They've, they've launched

1308
01:18:16,005 --> 01:18:19,925
Speaker 4:  this new set of models that are starting with oh one instead of GPT dash

1309
01:18:20,035 --> 01:18:23,965
Speaker 4:  four oh Turbo. Like they're getting slowly better at

1310
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:27,045
Speaker 4:  putting this in front of people in a way that is slightly understandable

1311
01:18:28,115 --> 01:18:30,245
Speaker 4:  that only goes as far as your products go.

1312
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:34,485
Speaker 3:  I will say chat.com 100% sounds like a 1990

1313
01:18:34,485 --> 01:18:37,725
Speaker 3:  dating site. That's, I mean that's just what that sounds like.

1314
01:18:37,805 --> 01:18:38,525
Speaker 4:  I mean it does great

1315
01:18:40,145 --> 01:18:42,485
Speaker 3:  And I met my wife there to be honest.

1316
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:46,045
Speaker 4:  Rename Chadic bt to plenty of Fish and we'll be good to go.

1317
01:18:48,535 --> 01:18:49,965
Speaker 3:  Shout out to Casey for the wife joke.

1318
01:18:49,995 --> 01:18:53,605
Speaker 4:  Wait, do you wanna know, by the way, I, I plugged all of this into Chad

1319
01:18:53,685 --> 01:18:56,885
Speaker 4:  GBT, all the stuff Dharmesh said to do, I just did. Yeah. And the, it gives

1320
01:18:57,045 --> 01:19:01,005
Speaker 4:  a lot of thoughts and then the conclusion it draws is Dharmesh

1321
01:19:01,005 --> 01:19:04,845
Speaker 4:  likely sold chat.com for around 20 to $30 million with 25 to

1322
01:19:04,845 --> 01:19:08,805
Speaker 4:  50% of that amount in open AI shares. Ordinarily that's based

1323
01:19:08,805 --> 01:19:12,365
Speaker 4:  on nothing. And I wouldn't believe it, but that, that's what he told us to

1324
01:19:12,365 --> 01:19:16,285
Speaker 4:  do. So I think you can take that as something like the truth. And if that's

1325
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:20,165
Speaker 4:  the case, and he did it a while ago, which it sounds like

1326
01:19:20,165 --> 01:19:24,085
Speaker 4:  he did, that man has made a ton of money on this domain

1327
01:19:24,085 --> 01:19:27,325
Speaker 4:  name because like what, what happened to the valuation of OpenAI with this

1328
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:31,285
Speaker 4:  new fundraising? What is, what like this was, this is a

1329
01:19:31,285 --> 01:19:34,695
Speaker 4:  damn good domain name purchase. If indeed it is what

1330
01:19:34,985 --> 01:19:36,215
Speaker 4:  Chate says it is, it's

1331
01:19:36,215 --> 01:19:39,735
Speaker 3:  So much better than debacle.com, which I simply let expire

1332
01:19:40,595 --> 01:19:41,375
Speaker 4:  You're missing out.

1333
01:19:41,755 --> 01:19:44,375
Speaker 3:  Do you think they're gonna rename chat GBT to just chat? No,

1334
01:19:45,265 --> 01:19:49,105
Speaker 4:  I don't. I think chat g bt is actually against all odds, a very good brand.

1335
01:19:49,365 --> 01:19:53,225
Speaker 4:  People know what it is. I think it, it actually explains itself better than

1336
01:19:53,225 --> 01:19:57,105
Speaker 4:  like Claude. And so there there is a, it it is

1337
01:19:57,105 --> 01:20:01,025
Speaker 4:  sort of Kleenex in the AI world right now where like people know

1338
01:20:01,085 --> 01:20:04,505
Speaker 4:  it better than any other AI product. And

1339
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:08,685
Speaker 4:  like If, you can make Google work for 25 years, you can probably make Chad

1340
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:11,525
Speaker 4:  GBT work for 25 years and yeah, I I think they work Is that,

1341
01:20:11,525 --> 01:20:15,085
Speaker 6:  Is that a problem for them? I I thought the famous thing about Kleenex was

1342
01:20:15,085 --> 01:20:18,165
Speaker 6:  that Kleenex did not like that Kleenex was

1343
01:20:18,435 --> 01:20:21,245
Speaker 3:  Generic. Oh, you were saying Kleenex, I thought you were saying K Clean exe.

1344
01:20:21,245 --> 01:20:22,645
Speaker 3:  And I was like, I don't know what David's talking about

1345
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:26,805
Speaker 3:  Kleenex. That's what you've been saying.

1346
01:20:27,785 --> 01:20:31,605
Speaker 4:  Oh boy, we all need to go outside.

1347
01:20:32,465 --> 01:20:35,445
Speaker 3:  Has has it been a weird few days? Is my brain mush?

1348
01:20:36,835 --> 01:20:37,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no.

1349
01:20:37,205 --> 01:20:40,845
Speaker 3:  Have I had to earn unearth stories from 2016 to 2020 and be like, oh, I used

1350
01:20:40,845 --> 01:20:44,245
Speaker 3:  to know a lot about this. Yes. Clean doe. Yeah, it's,

1351
01:20:44,395 --> 01:20:44,885
Speaker 4:  It's a classic,

1352
01:20:45,065 --> 01:20:46,965
Speaker 3:  It was a defra program that everyone loved.

1353
01:20:47,155 --> 01:20:49,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah. No, but Sean, to your point, I think, I think there is something to

1354
01:20:49,885 --> 01:20:53,525
Speaker 4:  that. I think it is, that's like real sort of champagne problems stuff

1355
01:20:53,595 --> 01:20:57,205
Speaker 4:  when you become so big that other people start associating knockoff

1356
01:20:57,205 --> 01:21:00,645
Speaker 4:  products with your product. Like everybody wants to have that problem, even

1357
01:21:00,645 --> 01:21:02,885
Speaker 4:  though that problem is kind of annoying. And I think,

1358
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,965
Speaker 3:  And even though that, just to be clear, that problem is also fake. Kleenex

1359
01:21:05,965 --> 01:21:09,125
Speaker 3:  owns its trademark. They have not lost the rights to the word Kleenex.

1360
01:21:09,225 --> 01:21:13,085
Speaker 4:  But the idea that you go see any tissue in the store by

1361
01:21:13,085 --> 01:21:15,925
Speaker 4:  any brand and you're like, oh, it's Kleenex is like, you can see how that's

1362
01:21:15,925 --> 01:21:18,485
Speaker 4:  a problem for Kleenex, but I don't think Kleenex is upset about it. I think

1363
01:21:18,485 --> 01:21:19,045
Speaker 4:  they're doing fine.

1364
01:21:19,885 --> 01:21:23,535
Speaker 3:  There's a well a fine, there's a, they made like a musical

1365
01:21:23,665 --> 01:21:27,385
Speaker 3:  about it or one of these companies with one of these names like this made

1366
01:21:27,385 --> 01:21:29,505
Speaker 3:  an entire musical about how you're not supposed to say it, you're supposed

1367
01:21:29,505 --> 01:21:31,985
Speaker 3:  to say something else, which is why they all say facial tissue. Amazing.

1368
01:21:32,015 --> 01:21:35,705
Speaker 3:  That is a, this is a horrible tangent and now it's time to talk about the

1369
01:21:35,705 --> 01:21:37,705
Speaker 3:  matter. Smart Home standard, which is my lightning run

1370
01:21:39,405 --> 01:21:43,345
Speaker 3:  matter. 1.4 is out, we're two years into this. I will tell

1371
01:21:43,345 --> 01:21:46,945
Speaker 3:  you that I needed a smart plug for our Halloween decorations and I bought

1372
01:21:48,255 --> 01:21:52,185
Speaker 3:  just the regular Miros home kit ones and the Miros matter ones

1373
01:21:52,185 --> 01:21:55,985
Speaker 3:  and the matter ones were so finicky that I just sent 'em back and I was like,

1374
01:21:55,985 --> 01:21:58,545
Speaker 3:  well this still isn't ready. And that's kind of where I'm at with matter.

1375
01:21:58,645 --> 01:22:02,265
Speaker 3:  But Matter 1.4 is out. Jen Tooey wrote about it. She's been tracking every

1376
01:22:02,315 --> 01:22:06,185
Speaker 3:  ounce of changes to the standard is always with matter updates,

1377
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:10,225
Speaker 3:  there's more devices. So there's heat pumps and solar panels. They did

1378
01:22:10,275 --> 01:22:13,305
Speaker 3:  robot vacuums. All this stuff is all happening. They still don't have security

1379
01:22:13,305 --> 01:22:17,185
Speaker 3:  cameras. The reason I wanna talk about it is, one, the vocabulary is

1380
01:22:17,185 --> 01:22:21,105
Speaker 3:  amazing and I need to explain to the vocabulary to

1381
01:22:21,105 --> 01:22:24,225
Speaker 3:  explain the thing that is good about Matter 1.4. So

1382
01:22:25,765 --> 01:22:29,665
Speaker 3:  in the matter standard, every smart home ecosystem is called

1383
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:30,105
Speaker 3:  a fabric.

1384
01:22:31,835 --> 01:22:35,535
Speaker 3:  You follow me on this? So Apple Home Kit is a fabric,

1385
01:22:35,915 --> 01:22:37,495
Speaker 3:  Amazon Alexa is a fabric,

1386
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:42,605
Speaker 3:  I don't know why they picked fabric. I'm guessing it's because the radio

1387
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:47,045
Speaker 3:  standard is called Thread. Yes. But they don't all run on thread.

1388
01:22:47,275 --> 01:22:51,045
Speaker 3:  It's very confusing. They're all called fabrics. And the big thing, the

1389
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:54,925
Speaker 3:  big, big thing in matter 1.4 is multimin

1390
01:22:54,925 --> 01:22:58,765
Speaker 3:  across fabrics, which is yet more vocabulary. But

1391
01:22:58,825 --> 01:23:02,685
Speaker 3:  all it really means is that when you set up all of your devices in Apple

1392
01:23:02,755 --> 01:23:06,005
Speaker 3:  Home and then connect to Alexa,

1393
01:23:06,475 --> 01:23:10,435
Speaker 3:  they all just go over there. So you don't have to set them up in two places

1394
01:23:10,535 --> 01:23:13,195
Speaker 3:  at once. Which is a thing you would've thought they would've figured out

1395
01:23:13,195 --> 01:23:14,355
Speaker 3:  from the beginning of matter.

1396
01:23:14,425 --> 01:23:16,555
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I just assumed that was how it already worked.

1397
01:23:16,865 --> 01:23:19,275
Speaker 3:  None of this, none of this worked at the beginning of matter. Like okay,

1398
01:23:19,375 --> 01:23:22,955
Speaker 3:  the border routers between wifi and thread weren't incompatible that

1399
01:23:23,495 --> 01:23:27,475
Speaker 3:  the auth was in Compat, like none of this stuff worked. So they've got, they've

1400
01:23:27,475 --> 01:23:30,275
Speaker 3:  had the standard on the market, which is, you know, apple

1401
01:23:31,195 --> 01:23:34,185
Speaker 3:  kinda like really pushed this. They've worked with Amazon, they've worked

1402
01:23:34,185 --> 01:23:37,585
Speaker 3:  with Google to get the standard out. It's built on HomeKit in a lot of ways.

1403
01:23:37,805 --> 01:23:41,665
Speaker 3:  And the idea is all of these smart home devices should be compatible with

1404
01:23:41,865 --> 01:23:45,785
Speaker 3:  everyone's ecosystems. And for about two years what that has meant is

1405
01:23:46,175 --> 01:23:49,975
Speaker 3:  there's more devices, but they're really only com only compatible

1406
01:23:49,975 --> 01:23:53,015
Speaker 3:  with the one you choose to make them compatible with. Right? If, you have

1407
01:23:53,155 --> 01:23:57,055
Speaker 3:  Google home stuff and Alexa stuff in your house and HomeKit you kinda like

1408
01:23:57,085 --> 01:24:00,535
Speaker 3:  pair your smart plug to one so you have more choice because

1409
01:24:01,155 --> 01:24:04,655
Speaker 3:  the matter accessory makers can just make one thing, but you don't actually

1410
01:24:04,655 --> 01:24:05,615
Speaker 3:  get more compatibility.

1411
01:24:06,285 --> 01:24:10,175
Speaker 4:  What you just described is directly against the whole point of matter,

1412
01:24:10,705 --> 01:24:12,655
Speaker 3:  Right? So they have finally done the thing,

1413
01:24:12,805 --> 01:24:13,775
Speaker 4:  They did matter, now

1414
01:24:14,165 --> 01:24:18,095
Speaker 3:  They did the thing they're calling it God enhance to multi admin.

1415
01:24:20,645 --> 01:24:24,465
Speaker 3:  It lets the thread, border routers thread is the lobe power wireless

1416
01:24:24,465 --> 01:24:27,625
Speaker 3:  signal that all this stuff's supposed to run on. So the border routers that

1417
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:31,105
Speaker 3:  bridge from thread to wifi are now compatible. So you can an hero and

1418
01:24:32,225 --> 01:24:34,505
Speaker 3:  a home pod mini and all this other stuff and they will bridge the thread

1419
01:24:34,505 --> 01:24:37,385
Speaker 3:  and make one big thread network instead of multiple thread networks, which

1420
01:24:37,385 --> 01:24:41,225
Speaker 3:  is what they've been doing up until now. They're doing

1421
01:24:41,305 --> 01:24:44,305
Speaker 3:  a better job of managing wifi routers that have thread routers in them. All

1422
01:24:44,305 --> 01:24:48,025
Speaker 3:  this stuff needed to exist. But the main thing is

1423
01:24:48,825 --> 01:24:52,705
Speaker 3:  bridging multi admin across fabrics, which is just platforms. And that means

1424
01:24:52,805 --> 01:24:56,315
Speaker 3:  you can set it all up in HomeKit and then you can buy an Amazon Alexa and

1425
01:24:56,315 --> 01:24:59,595
Speaker 3:  be like, I already have a matter, I already have all this stuff and it, we'll

1426
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:02,795
Speaker 3:  just figure it out. Now is any of that gonna work?

1427
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:08,475
Speaker 3:  Will it import your rooms and your device names and all the stuff

1428
01:25:08,475 --> 01:25:12,395
Speaker 3:  that you need to like really make that work? Un unclear. Jenna's very

1429
01:25:12,395 --> 01:25:16,155
Speaker 3:  good reporter. She asked the matter people this and they did not

1430
01:25:16,335 --> 01:25:16,555
Speaker 3:  say,

1431
01:25:17,315 --> 01:25:21,195
Speaker 6:  I really, really like Jen's whole quote in this story. I

1432
01:25:21,255 --> 01:25:25,075
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm hearing it in her British accent right now. Matter will make

1433
01:25:25,355 --> 01:25:27,995
Speaker 6:  everyone play together nicely this time. Promise.

1434
01:25:29,225 --> 01:25:32,155
Speaker 3:  Yeah, Bluetooth is gonna work great next year. That's, that's where matter

1435
01:25:32,155 --> 01:25:35,475
Speaker 3:  is. It's in the zone. And I forgot to mention, by the way, the reason I've

1436
01:25:35,475 --> 01:25:38,875
Speaker 3:  been pointing out it's called fabric this entire time is this is called fabric

1437
01:25:38,985 --> 01:25:39,275
Speaker 3:  sink,

1438
01:25:40,085 --> 01:25:43,835
Speaker 4:  Which is nothing. This thing should be called like needle or sewing machine.

1439
01:25:43,945 --> 01:25:46,915
Speaker 4:  Like there's a bunch of, there's so many things we could do here, but if

1440
01:25:46,915 --> 01:25:49,835
Speaker 4:  you're gonna commit to this stupid bit, you have to commit to it correctly.

1441
01:25:50,575 --> 01:25:52,835
Speaker 3:  And the quote from the call

1442
01:25:52,835 --> 01:25:54,995
Speaker 4:  It like color match. Like I listen, I have ideas

1443
01:25:56,265 --> 01:25:57,235
Speaker 6:  Poly in

1444
01:25:57,235 --> 01:26:00,835
Speaker 3:  The quote from the Connectivity Standards Alliance spokesperson here is if

1445
01:26:00,835 --> 01:26:04,165
Speaker 3:  a new device shows up on fabric A, it can automatically be added to fabric

1446
01:26:04,405 --> 01:26:04,525
Speaker 3:  B.

1447
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:09,775
Speaker 3:  However, it is unclear whether the correct name and location of the new device

1448
01:26:09,775 --> 01:26:12,215
Speaker 3:  will automatically go to the other platforms. If, you have to enter this

1449
01:26:12,415 --> 01:26:16,055
Speaker 3:  manually that will be up to the platforms to implement. So another year

1450
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:19,095
Speaker 3:  matter 1.5, everybody Bluetooth is gonna be great next year,

1451
01:26:20,715 --> 01:26:24,615
Speaker 3:  but this is the thing, we're so close, it's all coming into focus now,

1452
01:26:24,615 --> 01:26:28,095
Speaker 3:  right? You buy a smart home device, you just add it to one system,

1453
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:31,665
Speaker 3:  suddenly you can just talk to your Google home and access that device. This

1454
01:26:31,665 --> 01:26:33,545
Speaker 3:  is the thing everybody wants so close.

1455
01:26:34,005 --> 01:26:37,265
Speaker 4:  We are in that funny moment now where it's like, if we could just

1456
01:26:38,535 --> 01:26:42,225
Speaker 4:  pretend that every smart home gadget that had ever been made didn't exist

1457
01:26:42,485 --> 01:26:45,705
Speaker 4:  and start from scratch, we could build the good things so quickly.

1458
01:26:46,405 --> 01:26:50,385
Speaker 4:  But because we did the good things so late, everybody is having

1459
01:26:50,385 --> 01:26:54,185
Speaker 4:  to back their way into making this make any sense in a way that is just

1460
01:26:54,185 --> 01:26:58,105
Speaker 4:  gonna make it worse for everybody for a long time. Like every, every story

1461
01:26:58,105 --> 01:27:00,985
Speaker 4:  about matter getting better makes me wanna buy smart home products less

1462
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:02,425
Speaker 3:  Because

1463
01:27:02,525 --> 01:27:06,345
Speaker 4:  I'm like, this all sounds great and I have absolutely no belief that any

1464
01:27:06,345 --> 01:27:07,945
Speaker 4:  of it is coming to anything that I own. Ever.

1465
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:11,465
Speaker 3:  Look David, you just keep looking at your garbage TV and I'll let you know

1466
01:27:11,465 --> 01:27:15,425
Speaker 3:  when it's time. All right. By the way, I wanna say thank you to the dozens,

1467
01:27:15,805 --> 01:27:19,385
Speaker 3:  if not two dozens of people who wrote to me and

1468
01:27:19,405 --> 01:27:23,105
Speaker 3:  Joanna about smart garage door openers and the people in particular who

1469
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:26,985
Speaker 3:  mentioned the Rat Go product, which stands for Rage Against the Garage Door

1470
01:27:26,985 --> 01:27:30,945
Speaker 3:  opener. Amazing, incredible hobbyist project name. It is a hack

1471
01:27:31,015 --> 01:27:34,785
Speaker 3:  that gets past the Chamberlain security plus protocol, which it is true that

1472
01:27:34,785 --> 01:27:38,745
Speaker 3:  Joanna stood on a ladder and installed one of the things and she has a Chamberlain

1473
01:27:38,745 --> 01:27:42,625
Speaker 3:  thing, which drms the button, the button

1474
01:27:42,725 --> 01:27:46,665
Speaker 3:  on a Chamberlain. This is the power of Monopoly. The button is DMed

1475
01:27:46,665 --> 01:27:49,545
Speaker 3:  with a, the security protocol. So it's awful.

1476
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:50,185
Speaker 4:  It's

1477
01:27:50,185 --> 01:27:52,705
Speaker 3:  All ridiculous. But there's a hack called the Raco Rage against the garage

1478
01:27:52,705 --> 01:27:54,465
Speaker 3:  opener. And now she's ordering one of those, I believe.

1479
01:27:54,695 --> 01:27:55,105
Speaker 4:  Love that.

1480
01:27:56,015 --> 01:27:58,825
Speaker 3:  This is our community, you're our family. All right. No matter what happens

1481
01:27:58,845 --> 01:28:00,425
Speaker 3:  out there, we've got your back

1482
01:28:01,945 --> 01:28:05,005
Speaker 3:  and Joanna is literally texting me photos of herself on a ladder. It's very

1483
01:28:05,005 --> 01:28:06,925
Speaker 3:  good. All right, Sean, what do you got?

1484
01:28:07,845 --> 01:28:11,205
Speaker 6:  I also have a maros in my garage that I need to install and hopefully get

1485
01:28:11,205 --> 01:28:15,085
Speaker 6:  around the Chamberlain TRM button. But I've also got a

1486
01:28:15,205 --> 01:28:18,205
Speaker 6:  story about Nvidia, a company that made

1487
01:28:18,795 --> 01:28:22,565
Speaker 6:  $16.6 billion in pure profit last quarter

1488
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:27,285
Speaker 6:  has decided to cap the game streaming hours on GForce. Now

1489
01:28:27,425 --> 01:28:31,285
Speaker 6:  its cloud gaming service for its whales. I don't know why

1490
01:28:31,285 --> 01:28:35,245
Speaker 6:  they're doing this. They are doing it in the best way possible, believe

1491
01:28:35,245 --> 01:28:38,685
Speaker 6:  me, I I I will tell you all about it. So first off, it's a 100

1492
01:28:38,955 --> 01:28:42,685
Speaker 6:  hour cap per month. So you have to play more than like three

1493
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:46,405
Speaker 6:  hours every single day of cloud gaming, which is a lot of cloud

1494
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:50,325
Speaker 6:  gaming to get to this cap. Mm. And they're not

1495
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,405
Speaker 6:  going to instill that monthly cap until

1496
01:28:52,605 --> 01:28:56,525
Speaker 6:  January 1st, 2025 for new

1497
01:28:57,015 --> 01:29:00,525
Speaker 6:  users. And I think it'll be, yeah, 2026

1498
01:29:00,985 --> 01:29:03,605
Speaker 6:  for existing users before they lose their plate types. So If, you get in

1499
01:29:03,605 --> 01:29:07,245
Speaker 6:  now, or if you've already been a user, you don't have this monthly cap until

1500
01:29:07,305 --> 01:29:11,045
Speaker 6:  an entire year from January. In addition to that,

1501
01:29:11,455 --> 01:29:14,845
Speaker 6:  while some people were worried that they would lose their founders' memberships,

1502
01:29:14,845 --> 01:29:17,485
Speaker 6:  that they would suddenly have a cap on their founders' memberships that were

1503
01:29:17,845 --> 01:29:21,245
Speaker 6:  promised to have a certain quality of streaming for the rest of their lives,

1504
01:29:21,345 --> 01:29:25,045
Speaker 6:  as long as they maintain their monthly dues. And videos come out very recently

1505
01:29:25,105 --> 01:29:28,805
Speaker 6:  in an FAQ and they says, founders, as long as you keep paying, you won't

1506
01:29:28,805 --> 01:29:32,765
Speaker 6:  have a cap either. So founders are taken care of, existing customers

1507
01:29:32,765 --> 01:29:35,805
Speaker 6:  are taking care of for a year. New customers can get taken care of for a

1508
01:29:35,805 --> 01:29:39,605
Speaker 6:  year if they start early. Lots of lots. They, they,

1509
01:29:39,605 --> 01:29:43,365
Speaker 6:  they've gotten out ahead of this. They're telling everybody, it's clear,

1510
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:47,205
Speaker 6:  their messaging is clear. They're doing a good job compared to most of the

1511
01:29:47,485 --> 01:29:51,215
Speaker 6:  companies that we needle for this. But I don't understand why

1512
01:29:51,245 --> 01:29:54,735
Speaker 6:  they're doing it at all, because the only people they're going to hit with

1513
01:29:54,735 --> 01:29:57,855
Speaker 6:  this are the whales who I would assume

1514
01:29:58,715 --> 01:30:02,615
Speaker 6:  are their most vocal and passionate supporters of this

1515
01:30:02,965 --> 01:30:03,455
Speaker 6:  service.

1516
01:30:04,085 --> 01:30:06,415
Speaker 3:  Once you got a whale man, you just keep going after 'em.

1517
01:30:06,605 --> 01:30:09,335
Speaker 4:  Yeah, just keep raising prices. That's the way

1518
01:30:09,335 --> 01:30:10,735
Speaker 3:  It goes. You've never run a casino,

1519
01:30:10,955 --> 01:30:13,455
Speaker 6:  But they're not, they're not charging more. Look, why don't they, why don't

1520
01:30:13,455 --> 01:30:16,135
Speaker 6:  they, why don't they say, Hey, you know, well, well, well you can pay more

1521
01:30:16,135 --> 01:30:18,455
Speaker 6:  for the unlimited, but they don't have that as an option. They're just like,

1522
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:19,655
Speaker 6:  no, we're capping it for everybody.

1523
01:30:20,075 --> 01:30:23,955
Speaker 4:  So I. Actually, in a funny way, I think doing what you

1524
01:30:23,955 --> 01:30:27,835
Speaker 4:  just described ends up being a worse PR move to basically

1525
01:30:27,895 --> 01:30:31,395
Speaker 4:  say, oh, you want the unlimited thing now you have to pay more for it. You're

1526
01:30:31,395 --> 01:30:35,355
Speaker 4:  gonna piss people off more that way than doing what Nvidia did.

1527
01:30:35,635 --> 01:30:39,595
Speaker 4:  I still, I have two thoughts on this one. Maybe Nvidia should make

1528
01:30:39,595 --> 01:30:42,555
Speaker 4:  better chips that do all this stuff more efficiently. This sounds like an

1529
01:30:42,555 --> 01:30:46,315
Speaker 4:  Nvidia problem, not an anybody else problem. You got a bunch of money,

1530
01:30:46,365 --> 01:30:48,835
Speaker 4:  maybe you should make better chips. Nvidia, that's just thought. I think

1531
01:30:48,835 --> 01:30:52,195
Speaker 4:  number two, and this was everywhere in the comments on this story,

1532
01:30:52,755 --> 01:30:55,315
Speaker 4:  and it was my reaction too, is just like, oh God,

1533
01:30:56,345 --> 01:31:00,155
Speaker 4:  another really great reason to not bet on cloud gaming is, is

1534
01:31:00,225 --> 01:31:04,115
Speaker 4:  like everywhere you turn, it feels like something about this deal is

1535
01:31:04,115 --> 01:31:07,715
Speaker 4:  not living up to its potential. And it's, I mean, it, it goes back to the

1536
01:31:07,715 --> 01:31:10,995
Speaker 4:  same stuff we're talking about with even just downloading digital games.

1537
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:14,995
Speaker 4:  Like there, there is this sense that all

1538
01:31:14,995 --> 01:31:18,155
Speaker 4:  of this could be ripped away from me at any time. And none of these companies

1539
01:31:18,155 --> 01:31:22,035
Speaker 4:  are doing anything to make that not feel like the case. And

1540
01:31:22,035 --> 01:31:24,715
Speaker 4:  even this, I, I agree with you that this is a relatively small thing and

1541
01:31:24,715 --> 01:31:27,715
Speaker 4:  it will not hit that many people, but it's just another one of those things

1542
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:31,685
Speaker 4:  that's like, maybe don't bet too much on this

1543
01:31:31,685 --> 01:31:32,885
Speaker 4:  being a good thing for you forever.

1544
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:37,245
Speaker 6:  I wrote a piece three years ago that the only way cloud gaming is gonna

1545
01:31:37,275 --> 01:31:41,165
Speaker 6:  succeed is if it removes all of this friction. And

1546
01:31:41,165 --> 01:31:44,965
Speaker 6:  it theoretically could, like once upon a time you could just press

1547
01:31:45,115 --> 01:31:48,555
Speaker 6:  a button on a web browser and you'd be playing a game instantly in your web

1548
01:31:48,555 --> 01:31:49,715
Speaker 6:  browser. No problem. On a Chromebooks

1549
01:31:49,715 --> 01:31:51,435
Speaker 4:  Thing, you can do Assassin's Creed. Yeah.

1550
01:31:51,735 --> 01:31:54,355
Speaker 6:  But, but, but I wrote, I I just put, laid out a list of bullet points there.

1551
01:31:54,355 --> 01:31:56,995
Speaker 6:  These are all the things that go through people's minds. Yeah. Before they

1552
01:31:56,995 --> 01:32:00,405
Speaker 6:  sign up for cloud gaming. What if my connection isn't good enough? What if

1553
01:32:00,405 --> 01:32:03,445
Speaker 6:  my home networking gear isn't good enough? What if I live too far away from

1554
01:32:03,445 --> 01:32:06,525
Speaker 6:  the servers? Will it actually have the games I wanna play? Will there be

1555
01:32:06,525 --> 01:32:09,765
Speaker 6:  enough of them to justify the fee? Will developers bother to port new games

1556
01:32:09,765 --> 01:32:13,565
Speaker 6:  over? Will they run as well as if I just bought a console or pc? Will I need

1557
01:32:13,605 --> 01:32:17,205
Speaker 6:  a special controller, a dongle? Will I go over my data cap? Will I be able

1558
01:32:17,205 --> 01:32:20,325
Speaker 6:  to play with my friends who are in different platforms? Will I lose access

1559
01:32:20,325 --> 01:32:23,685
Speaker 6:  to my games if they lose a distribution deal or shut down the servers? Will

1560
01:32:23,685 --> 01:32:27,085
Speaker 6:  I have to wait in line to play the games? Can I get my save games? What about

1561
01:32:27,085 --> 01:32:30,485
Speaker 6:  the outages? Are they hiding how well these games will run? What if the company

1562
01:32:30,485 --> 01:32:34,085
Speaker 6:  decides it no longer wants to be a game company? Which has happened to several

1563
01:32:34,225 --> 01:32:37,245
Speaker 6:  of these platforms now. There's just so much

1564
01:32:38,195 --> 01:32:42,005
Speaker 6:  uncertainty going in. And just one more piece here from

1565
01:32:42,065 --> 01:32:42,485
Speaker 6:  Nvidia.

1566
01:32:42,755 --> 01:32:46,565
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You've sold me. I'm buying a $700 PS five Pro. I'm

1567
01:32:46,565 --> 01:32:47,725
Speaker 3:  sitting two feet away from it.

1568
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:50,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Every time, every time we talk about this stuff, I'm like, I'm all

1569
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:54,685
Speaker 4:  in on Blu-rays again, I'm all in on game cartridges and I'm buying a console.

1570
01:32:54,795 --> 01:32:57,965
Speaker 4:  Like it's, it's the only way. Turn off all the internet and just let me play

1571
01:32:57,965 --> 01:32:59,565
Speaker 4:  games offline. It's gonna be fine. Yeah.

1572
01:32:59,685 --> 01:33:03,605
Speaker 3:  Homesteading. But for video games, yeah. I'm gonna grow them myself

1573
01:33:03,605 --> 01:33:04,045
Speaker 3:  outside.

1574
01:33:04,235 --> 01:33:07,925
Speaker 6:  It's too bad though. 'cause, 'cause 'cause it works so well and those people

1575
01:33:07,925 --> 01:33:09,805
Speaker 6:  that Nvidia are capping know it. Yeah.

1576
01:33:10,665 --> 01:33:13,485
Speaker 3:  Is GForce nine a success? I mean, you mentioned how much money they're making,

1577
01:33:13,485 --> 01:33:17,405
Speaker 3:  but they're making money selling H one hundreds to meta. Is, is GForce now

1578
01:33:17,485 --> 01:33:18,325
Speaker 3:  a success for them?

1579
01:33:19,025 --> 01:33:21,885
Speaker 6:  We don't know. I mean, I'm guessing it's it's got, it's gotta be a cost for

1580
01:33:21,885 --> 01:33:25,525
Speaker 6:  them. You know, because they have, they have massive

1581
01:33:26,005 --> 01:33:29,605
Speaker 6:  hardware investment and, and, and infrastructure investment to stand this

1582
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:33,525
Speaker 6:  thing up. Theoretically they could say, oh yeah,

1583
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:36,925
Speaker 6:  we've got a data center that can do this AI thing, or it could also do that

1584
01:33:36,925 --> 01:33:40,245
Speaker 6:  GForce now thing. Maybe they're starting to build it that way. But last time

1585
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:43,565
Speaker 6:  I looked there were special cloud gaming

1586
01:33:44,205 --> 01:33:47,925
Speaker 6:  specific data centers for this thing laid out in a

1587
01:33:47,925 --> 01:33:50,205
Speaker 6:  particular way with particular chips. So

1588
01:33:50,465 --> 01:33:53,845
Speaker 4:  It also kinda makes you wonder if they're capping it at a hundred hours a

1589
01:33:53,845 --> 01:33:57,525
Speaker 4:  month, what are the whales playing like the, the, the

1590
01:33:57,625 --> 01:34:01,605
Speaker 4:  top 1% of GForce now users, like how many hours a month

1591
01:34:01,635 --> 01:34:05,605
Speaker 4:  must they be playing for Nvidia to decide that it has to have this hard cap?

1592
01:34:06,115 --> 01:34:09,045
Speaker 4:  It's gotta be a lot like If. you have If, you have a bunch of people who

1593
01:34:09,045 --> 01:34:13,005
Speaker 4:  are at like 102 hours. You're not introducing this cap. They're like,

1594
01:34:13,005 --> 01:34:15,685
Speaker 4:  they found somebody who is just like, has the
