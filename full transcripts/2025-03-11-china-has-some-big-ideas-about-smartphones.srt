Description: In this episode, what's old is new again, and what's new is... AI again. The Verge's Allison Johnson and Dominic Preston join David to discuss their experience at Mobile World Congress 2025, where they saw the latest devices from Xiaomi, Samsung, Realme, and others — and found themselves confronted with some big, surprising new ideas about how our smartphones should look and work. After that, Kevin Rose and Justin Mezzell talk about the process of bringing Digg back, and how AI can improve the way social networks operate. Digg got a lot of things right two decades ago, and plans to do it all over again now. Finally, we answer a question about printers from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!), with some help from Framework CEO Nirav Patel.

00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:06,795
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Camera Bump

3
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:10,635
Speaker 1:  functionality. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am sitting here trying

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:14,475
Speaker 1:  to decide which iPad is the best. So I

5
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:18,355
Speaker 1:  have the new mini, which came out last fall. I have the New Air, which is

6
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:22,275
Speaker 1:  coming out this week. I have the M four Pro,

7
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:26,195
Speaker 1:  which came out like roughly this time last year. And then I have the M two

8
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:29,835
Speaker 1:  Air, which is now last year's model, which also came out about a year ago.

9
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:34,035
Speaker 1:  So basically I have in my hands every iPad you can buy except for

10
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:37,435
Speaker 1:  the new base iPad. I've not tried that one yet. I have

11
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:41,595
Speaker 1:  lots of questions, but I generally think that the base iPad is the right

12
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:45,555
Speaker 1:  iPad for most people. So I both have to review the

13
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:49,435
Speaker 1:  new ones and I have to go back and update our iPad buying guide on the site.

14
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:53,475
Speaker 1:  So it requires a lot of like existential thinking about tablets that

15
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:57,875
Speaker 1:  I found myself not ready for. So If you have thoughts on how

16
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:01,875
Speaker 1:  you use an iPad and how to basically pick between them for people,

17
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:05,715
Speaker 1:  I would love to hear them. But until then, I'm just gonna be playing games

18
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:09,795
Speaker 1:  on all of these iPads and that's just what I do now. This is

19
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:13,755
Speaker 1:  my life anyway. We are mostly not gonna talk about iPads on this episode.

20
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:17,355
Speaker 1:  We're gonna come back and do some more iPad stuff once I've had a chance

21
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:21,155
Speaker 1:  to try the base iPad, which will hopefully be soon. Today on the show,

22
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:24,395
Speaker 1:  we're gonna do two things. First, we're gonna catch up with Alison Johnson

23
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:28,355
Speaker 1:  and Dom Preston on our team. They were both at MWC Mobile World Congress

24
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,235
Speaker 1:  last week, seeing all the weirdest and newest ideas in mobile. Gonna catch

25
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:35,675
Speaker 1:  up with them, see what they learned. And then I'm gonna talk to Kevin Rose

26
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:39,515
Speaker 1:  and Justin Metzel, who are two of the people responsible for bringing back

27
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:43,915
Speaker 1:  Dig. Dig, an OG Social Network coming back for real

28
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:48,195
Speaker 1:  in 2025. Right now it's just a landing page and a wait list, but

29
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:51,395
Speaker 1:  it is, it is coming. It's a real thing. And we had a really interesting conversation

30
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:55,075
Speaker 1:  about community and how to build the social internet with

31
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:58,675
Speaker 1:  AI and how we can do this better than we did the first time. And so I figured

32
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:02,115
Speaker 1:  you guys should hear it. It's really interesting stuff. We also have a hotline

33
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:05,995
Speaker 1:  about printers that I'm very excited to get into. All of that is coming up

34
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:09,675
Speaker 1:  in just a second. But first, I think I have between

35
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:13,955
Speaker 1:  one and 16 software updates to do on these iPads.

36
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:18,195
Speaker 1:  Developer beta's, deeply terrifying thing when you're a product

37
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:21,315
Speaker 1:  viewer. Anyway, this is The Vergecast, we'll be right back.

38
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:07,815
Speaker 1:  I just, it's too many tablets. I can't keep them straight. They all look

39
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:11,735
Speaker 1:  the same. We'll worry about that later. Let's get into MWC. So MWC Mobile

40
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:15,415
Speaker 1:  World Congress for many years has been the kind of the biggest

41
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:18,815
Speaker 1:  show in mobile in the way that CES is like TVs and Cars.

42
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:23,895
Speaker 1:  MWC is phones. And for a few years, MWC got

43
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:27,855
Speaker 1:  kind of boring. Frankly, the phone market kind of died because no one else

44
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:31,655
Speaker 1:  could get into it. It was just Samsung and Apple and then a bunch of stuff

45
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:35,575
Speaker 1:  in China and kind of nothing else. But the mobile industry is actually

46
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,175
Speaker 1:  really interesting right now. And there are a lot of companies with new ideas

47
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:41,935
Speaker 1:  about smartphones, particularly as we get AI and particularly

48
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:45,735
Speaker 1:  as cameras become important in an AI world. Again, there's just a lot of

49
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:49,135
Speaker 1:  new ideas about phones. And so two folks on our team, Alison Johnson

50
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:53,015
Speaker 1:  and Dominic Preston went to MWC. They saw all this stuff

51
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:56,775
Speaker 1:  and I have lots of questions about all the stuff that they saw. So let's

52
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:59,855
Speaker 1:  just get into it. Here we go. Alison Johnson. Hello,

53
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:00,615
Speaker 6:  Hello.

54
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:04,615
Speaker 1:  And Dom Preston, welcome to The Vergecast. Hello. Thank you. Happy to be

55
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:08,605
Speaker 1:  here. Alison, I'm really sorry for not being as enthusiastic about you. Oh,

56
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:09,205
Speaker 6:  It's all

57
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:12,765
Speaker 1:  Right. I'm like, I'm also happy that you're here. I get it. Yeah,

58
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:16,765
Speaker 1:  I'm just, it's Dom's first time. I want Dom to feel welcome on The Vergecast.

59
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:18,245
Speaker 6:  It's exciting. Yeah,

60
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,205
Speaker 1:  I'm the shiny new thing. So you got, you two were just at MWC.

61
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:25,605
Speaker 1:  It seems like kind of an interesting year. Like tell me first just sort of

62
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:29,005
Speaker 1:  the, the vibes in Barcelona at MWC this year. What was it like?

63
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:33,205
Speaker 6:  It was kind of two things. There's like the phones and

64
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:37,085
Speaker 6:  they were sort of boring. And then there was everything

65
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,645
Speaker 6:  else, which was like

66
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:43,805
Speaker 6:  laptops that fold, a whole bunch stuff you put on your phone,

67
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:48,205
Speaker 6:  stuff you used to charge your phone, you know, it's a cool kind of like

68
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:52,285
Speaker 6:  reprieve from the, the moment we're in of like, yeah,

69
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,565
Speaker 6:  phones are boring, they're, they're good now. You know, like

70
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,605
Speaker 6:  there's Xmi 15 Ultra, which Dom tested

71
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:04,325
Speaker 6:  is incredible by all accounts. So it

72
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:07,965
Speaker 6:  was nice. It's, it's nice to go see like weird cool stuff.

73
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:09,885
Speaker 1:  Dom, what was your experience like?

74
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:14,045
Speaker 7:  It similar, I think even the biggest phone phone launch

75
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:17,605
Speaker 7:  is the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. And it's a great phone. It's a very cool phone. I

76
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:21,165
Speaker 7:  was really impressed by it, but it's a super iterative update on last year's

77
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:24,285
Speaker 7:  January 14 ultra. So like the most exciting phone launch of the show

78
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:28,325
Speaker 7:  wasn't all that exciting, right? But as Allison said, we just had all these

79
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:31,885
Speaker 7:  weird little odyssey going around accessories, concept

80
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:35,765
Speaker 7:  devices, concept, everything this time fo all

81
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:39,645
Speaker 7:  things, weird cameras, all sorts of stuff. And then the, the like

82
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:43,085
Speaker 7:  smaller brands playing around with just odd versions of phones like

83
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:46,965
Speaker 7:  Nubia releasing a few strange kind of a hundred dollars phones that

84
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:50,925
Speaker 7:  no one in the states can even buy that have rotating camera rings and giant

85
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:52,925
Speaker 7:  speakers on the back and, and weird stuff like that.

86
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,005
Speaker 1:  What's y'all sense? I wanna talk mostly about some of these specific gadgets,

87
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,925
Speaker 1:  but looking through the stuff that you guys covered, I found myself wondering

88
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:04,525
Speaker 1:  how real these companies think these products are.

89
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:08,445
Speaker 1:  I had this experience a bunch of years ago. I was in a, in a Lenovo

90
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:12,445
Speaker 1:  briefing at one of these trade shows, and they had this very cool looking

91
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:16,445
Speaker 1:  orange laptop, and the product person I was talking to was

92
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:19,245
Speaker 1:  like, oh, we're not gonna sell any of those. They're just there. So people

93
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:22,645
Speaker 1:  will come look at it and then they'll buy the black laptop. And that is like,

94
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:26,605
Speaker 1:  I have thought about that nonstop ever since. And what I wonder about so

95
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:30,365
Speaker 1:  many of these gadgets is like, yes, we're in a very sort of

96
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:34,285
Speaker 1:  iterative moment with smartphones. And so if I am Samsung or

97
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:37,845
Speaker 1:  Xmi or Huawei or Lenovo or any of these companies that you're seeing make

98
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:41,445
Speaker 1:  this stuff, are they actually seriously

99
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,125
Speaker 1:  making these things as in like this, this might be the next phone that you

100
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,605
Speaker 1:  want. Or are these like wild science projects that somebody built in the

101
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:52,005
Speaker 1:  lab that they're showing you so that we will cover them on The Verge dot

102
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,685
Speaker 1:  com even though they know absolutely no one ever will buy them?

103
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:59,245
Speaker 6:  I think it's like a range of stuff. And Lenovo's a good example because

104
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:03,285
Speaker 6:  they, the briefing we got, they literally had two rooms.

105
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:07,165
Speaker 6:  They're like, here are the real laptops, you have to go to the

106
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:10,645
Speaker 6:  other room. And that's where the weird laptops are interesting that like

107
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:14,485
Speaker 6:  fold and charge with solar panels and there's like a weird little

108
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:18,445
Speaker 6:  guy you put on your, your computer. So,

109
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:22,325
Speaker 6:  and I think even in that room there's degrees of like, this might be a real

110
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:26,245
Speaker 6:  thing. They had that weird, like, see,

111
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:30,125
Speaker 6:  it's like extra screens for your laptop that you kind of

112
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,925
Speaker 6:  like magnet to the back of your computer and then you

113
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:37,605
Speaker 6:  have like the, the wildest desk set up at a coffee

114
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:38,325
Speaker 6:  shop ever.

115
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:44,205
Speaker 6:  I don't know, I don't see that. Like it'll be strangely

116
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:47,365
Speaker 6:  if I can go to Best Buy and and pick that up someday.

117
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,365
Speaker 6:  But other stuff I think is, is like

118
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:54,085
Speaker 6:  plausible. The, the question is,

119
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:59,245
Speaker 6:  yeah, like in the US especially at something like Mobile

120
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:03,125
Speaker 6:  World Congress, are we gonna get these things or are we gonna

121
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:07,045
Speaker 6:  get even just the like $200 phone that that

122
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:10,525
Speaker 6:  company sells that like, kind of has some features.

123
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:14,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's kind of all over the place, I think.

124
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:18,405
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Dom playing with these phones, you're, you're like standing there attaching

125
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:22,325
Speaker 1:  an enormous camera lens to a smartphone. Like are you, are you looking at

126
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:25,125
Speaker 1:  these things being like, this is a real thing that maybe people will have

127
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,685
Speaker 1:  in the real world on their phone someday? Or are you just like, neat thing

128
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:28,765
Speaker 1:  that you made that I'll never see again,

129
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:33,645
Speaker 7:  Trying to do a little bit of both. I guess you'd always know, okay. Especially

130
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:36,365
Speaker 7:  with ones like that, those concept devices where someone, they're explicitly

131
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:39,285
Speaker 7:  saying, this is not yet a product or at least and, and maybe never will be.

132
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,325
Speaker 7:  You're partly trying to assess how cool is it? Is it cool, is it fun?

133
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:47,845
Speaker 7:  Does this like solve some hypothetical version of a problem, even if it's

134
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:50,805
Speaker 7:  not practical in any way? But then there is that bit of you looking, you

135
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:53,645
Speaker 7:  know, sometimes versions of these concept devices do come out, you know,

136
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:58,125
Speaker 7:  the big DSLR lens on the back of a camera is maybe a less practical version.

137
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:02,285
Speaker 7:  But then, you know, XMI had this concept where they had a much

138
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:05,845
Speaker 7:  smaller lens that attached to the back of a phone via MagSafe style

139
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:09,725
Speaker 7:  connection. And that's still a concept that's absolutely not

140
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,445
Speaker 7:  a product will not be a product anytime in the next two

141
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,885
Speaker 7:  to three years. But I could imagine a world where it was, and you're kind

142
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:19,845
Speaker 7:  of playing around with that one and you, you start going, oh, this kind of

143
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:23,445
Speaker 7:  does work. This is kind of practical. Like I could imagine a world where

144
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:26,725
Speaker 7:  this is a product that comes out and this is maybe one I would actually want.

145
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:27,635
Speaker 7:  Okay.

146
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:31,835
Speaker 1:  I I, I'm hopeful that you guys are right. I think you might've just both

147
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:35,475
Speaker 1:  been very nice about a bunch of things that are definitely nonsense, but

148
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:37,555
Speaker 1:  I'm some of, I'm hopeful that you're right in that there is at least,

149
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,795
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah, there's nonsense.

150
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:42,875
Speaker 7:  The the 200 mil telephoto DSLR is is not, yeah.

151
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:47,675
Speaker 1:  Let's, let's start there Tom, because I wanna run through a bunch of,

152
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:51,715
Speaker 1:  I think the wildest things you saw and just hear about your experiences with

153
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:55,595
Speaker 1:  them. And I feel like Dom, your, your beat was just weird ideas about cameras

154
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:56,635
Speaker 1:  at MWC

155
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:57,875
Speaker 7:  Accidentally. Yeah.

156
00:10:58,055 --> 00:11:00,355
Speaker 1:  So take me through some of the strangest cameras you saw.

157
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:04,435
Speaker 7:  Okay, so I mean the two of the big concepts, so you kind of to around 'em

158
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:08,515
Speaker 7:  a little already, Realme showed off something we've basically

159
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:11,795
Speaker 7:  kind of seen before already from other brands, including Xiaomi a couple

160
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:15,675
Speaker 7:  years ago. But they showed a concept phone where you could put

161
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:19,395
Speaker 7:  A-D-S-L-R-M mount adapter on the back of the camera

162
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:23,955
Speaker 7:  and then strap your big real DSLR lens

163
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:28,075
Speaker 7:  to the phone. It actually had a, a one inch type sensor in

164
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:31,755
Speaker 7:  the camera module, but with no lens on top of it. So basically the only lens

165
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:35,595
Speaker 7:  was whatever DSLR you, you threw on the top of it. This

166
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:40,235
Speaker 7:  is cool for people who own DSLRs already and think, wow, wouldn't it

167
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:44,035
Speaker 7:  be fun to, you know, throw this lens on a phone sometime you,

168
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:47,915
Speaker 7:  you know, it's nonsense because they made a point of demoing it with

169
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,755
Speaker 7:  this giant, giant telephoto lens and they actually

170
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:54,285
Speaker 7:  brought a smaller portrait lens too. And I kind of would've liked to try

171
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:57,805
Speaker 7:  that and I didn't get the chance to, because that might have felt almost

172
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:00,725
Speaker 7:  practical. Like I can imagine a more compact lens strapped on the back of

173
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:04,565
Speaker 7:  a phone halfway towards something I might ever use.

174
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,005
Speaker 7:  Having this huge tele photo that's like three, four times the size and weight

175
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:12,805
Speaker 7:  of the phone itself strapped to one end of the device, like

176
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:16,205
Speaker 7:  weighing the whole thing down and with no like meaningful camera body to

177
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:20,045
Speaker 7:  grab onto. It's frankly a terrible experience. It was,

178
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:22,765
Speaker 7:  it was really awful. It's cool. Again, this is in that space of concert,

179
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:25,525
Speaker 7:  you're like, this is cool, this is fun. I'm shooting with this massive lens

180
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:29,365
Speaker 7:  on a phone and the photo comes out really lovely, but awful, awful experience.

181
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:33,285
Speaker 7:  You'd never ever wanna use that in a million years. And then the xmi equivalent

182
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,405
Speaker 7:  was a little more practical.

183
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:38,565
Speaker 1:  I just love the theory that you're like, okay, carrying a big lens around,

184
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:42,765
Speaker 1:  totally doable, but carrying a whole big camera around way too much

185
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:43,405
Speaker 1:  that's like,

186
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:44,725
Speaker 7:  Oh, that's where we draw the line. Yeah.

187
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:46,925
Speaker 1:  Who

188
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:50,605
Speaker 7:  Would wanna do that? Who'd wanna carry a camera body around God awful.

189
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,285
Speaker 7:  It's finally someone's come along and solved that problem. Yeah,

190
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:55,285
Speaker 1:  But you said the Xiaomi one is a little more reasonable.

191
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:59,685
Speaker 7:  Yes and no. I think it gets around a couple problems with this.

192
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:04,085
Speaker 7:  One is they had much smaller lenses, which immediately one may over

193
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,845
Speaker 7:  their solution is like much more proprietary, much more custom. They basically

194
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:11,325
Speaker 7:  have this, this small lens they built for themselves that

195
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:15,085
Speaker 7:  magnetically attached to the back of a custom version of one of their phones.

196
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:18,605
Speaker 7:  So it didn't actually attach to the existing camera. It goes right in the

197
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:21,845
Speaker 7:  middle of the phone's body, which immediately makes it a lot more balanced.

198
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:24,485
Speaker 7:  You don't have the lens all in one end, it's in the middle. It feels a bit

199
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:27,965
Speaker 7:  more like a real camera set up, a little bit more comfortable to hold. The

200
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:32,085
Speaker 7:  magnetic attachment is quicker, it's easier, it's less bulky, it just feels

201
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:35,725
Speaker 7:  a lot cooler and a lot more sci-fi. They also,

202
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:39,485
Speaker 7:  because it attaches to the body of the phone rather than the the camera,

203
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,565
Speaker 7:  it can't take advantage of the image sensors in the phone. So what they actually

204
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:47,205
Speaker 7:  did instead was put a sensor into this lens. It's this one little self-contained

205
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:51,125
Speaker 7:  unit that has lens and sensor and then magnets to the phone. The

206
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,125
Speaker 7:  perk of that is you can get a bigger sensor in there. So they had a four

207
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,805
Speaker 7:  thirds type sensor rather than the, the one inch that is the biggest

208
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:00,205
Speaker 7:  you're gonna find in any phone right now. So you're getting a bigger sensor

209
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,485
Speaker 7:  and a bigger lens. The lens was still something that could actually fit in

210
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:07,925
Speaker 7:  your pocket pretty comfortably. It MagSafe, well not, not

211
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:11,565
Speaker 7:  MagSafe MagSafe, but it basically mags safes to the phone pretty

212
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:14,845
Speaker 7:  immediately and then uses an optical connection to transfer the data. And

213
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:18,675
Speaker 7:  then the phone handles all the actual processing. So that I get,

214
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:21,635
Speaker 7:  because it immediately felt like, oh, this is just like

215
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:26,475
Speaker 7:  a lens add-on, like someone like moment does, but a lot better. It's a bit

216
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:30,435
Speaker 7:  like Allison pointed out this line of Sony cameras from like 12 years ago

217
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:33,595
Speaker 7:  or something that clamped onto a phone. And this is

218
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:37,755
Speaker 7:  ultimately, it's just that again, more than a decade later, they just replaced

219
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:41,425
Speaker 7:  the clamp with a magnet. But, you know, it works,

220
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:44,545
Speaker 7:  it's cool. Obviously it'll come down to price and things like that. And this

221
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:46,985
Speaker 7:  is so conceptual that we're, we're nowhere near anything like that though.

222
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:51,205
Speaker 1:  Alison, my, my stake in the ground on Friday show is that I think

223
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:54,125
Speaker 1:  this is an extremely good idea, really. And I sincerely hope that somebody

224
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,205
Speaker 1:  actually makes and ships this thing. But you're a, you're more of a camera

225
00:14:57,205 --> 00:15:00,445
Speaker 1:  person than I am in general. What do you think of this hole? What If you

226
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:03,525
Speaker 1:  just, okay. Shoved a camera onto your phone idea. You,

227
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:07,605
Speaker 6:  You lived through the Sony qx? I did because we

228
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:11,525
Speaker 6:  looked it up on The Verge dot com and it was a David Pierce review.

229
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:16,045
Speaker 6:  I don't know, I just like, I saw that come and go, this is the,

230
00:15:16,105 --> 00:15:17,365
Speaker 6:  the clamp thing

231
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:22,525
Speaker 6:  and you're at first you're like, this great, this is cool, like big sensor

232
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:25,765
Speaker 6:  for your phone. You just take it out, put it on. And I was obviously like

233
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:29,845
Speaker 6:  way more clunky than something on magnets on your phone. But the thing

234
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,205
Speaker 6:  it did not solve is that you're, you're carrying around an extra thing. You're

235
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:37,085
Speaker 6:  still like carrying and at that point do you just carry

236
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:41,045
Speaker 6:  a camera and, and that, that's where it falls apart a little bit for

237
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:44,925
Speaker 6:  me. I think it's cool as hell. Like yeah, I wanna try that. I

238
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:48,845
Speaker 6:  want a mag save lens on my phone and I'll give it a shot.

239
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:53,005
Speaker 6:  But I just had such deja vu where I was like, we're

240
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,565
Speaker 6:  doing this again. Oh my God.

241
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:59,445
Speaker 1:  Yeah. There are no new ideas. Just new attachment systems I think is like

242
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:03,325
Speaker 1:  basically where we are with technology right now. Yeah. Allison, the

243
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:06,805
Speaker 1:  gadget that you saw that I would say I have the most questions about is the,

244
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,765
Speaker 1:  the Noal AI phone, which I have now spent a lot of

245
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:14,565
Speaker 1:  time staring at and don't understand at all. And I would like you to explain

246
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:15,325
Speaker 1:  this thing to me please.

247
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I have a similar feeling about it. So

248
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,125
Speaker 6:  this is a company called Noal. They're based

249
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:27,085
Speaker 6:  kind of in blockchain stuff. The first thing they said to me in

250
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,965
Speaker 6:  my briefing was that they never sold cryptocurrency and they were emphatic

251
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:34,725
Speaker 6:  about that. So that sets the stage for this. It's a little,

252
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,965
Speaker 6:  a kind of rectangle phone, like a small phone

253
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:43,445
Speaker 6:  runs Android. There's sort of two parts to the screen. There's

254
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:47,365
Speaker 6:  this like top little display and then the bottom

255
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:51,325
Speaker 6:  one where the normal phone stuff is. And on the top part of the display

256
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:55,605
Speaker 6:  is your avatar. Like it creates

257
00:16:56,245 --> 00:17:00,125
Speaker 6:  a version of you based on your, you know,

258
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,285
Speaker 6:  some photos, video, you talking, whatever. And

259
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:08,045
Speaker 6:  that is your AI assistant. And the idea

260
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:12,085
Speaker 6:  is you upload, you like go around

261
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:15,885
Speaker 6:  to to meta and you know, Google download all your

262
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:19,725
Speaker 6:  data because they all have a system for like data

263
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:23,165
Speaker 6:  portability and you bring it over to the Noodle

264
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:27,845
Speaker 6:  os and you upload it there and you train this,

265
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:32,285
Speaker 6:  you know, AI version of you on all your stuff. They even

266
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,805
Speaker 6:  have this like in the onboarding, I didn't see this, but they

267
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,445
Speaker 6:  described it that you can describe the things you want in the future

268
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,045
Speaker 6:  and kind of like input that as like, here's the kind of thing

269
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:47,925
Speaker 6:  I'm interested in doing. Wow. It's so wild.

270
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:51,965
Speaker 6:  Like, so this little version of you when you summon it

271
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:55,165
Speaker 6:  on the phone kind of pops up and just stares back at you

272
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,525
Speaker 6:  and you tell it to do stuff. And that was the, like

273
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:04,085
Speaker 6:  there, there's a lot of the like similar, you know, call an Uber was like

274
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:08,365
Speaker 6:  the thing every AI assistant was doing on the show. We're just calling

275
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:12,005
Speaker 6:  Ubers all over the frigging place. Sure. But like, write a letter

276
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:16,405
Speaker 6:  or you know, someone calls and your,

277
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,405
Speaker 6:  the AI version of yourself answers the phone and, and talks to that

278
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:24,285
Speaker 6:  person and answers questions. They're like, oh, Allison's in a meeting

279
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:27,765
Speaker 6:  right now, blah, blah blah. And you, he could be like,

280
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:32,765
Speaker 6:  ask about some my availability to do something and

281
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:36,525
Speaker 6:  it would answer. So the one that really got me,

282
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:40,565
Speaker 6:  they showed me some live demos on this

283
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:44,085
Speaker 6:  device. They had it by a car insurance policy.

284
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:48,965
Speaker 6:  And the thing they told me was that they actually bought a

285
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:52,845
Speaker 6:  secondhand car so that they could run through this demo.

286
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,125
Speaker 6:  And it was going through, it's, it's very kind of rabbit

287
00:18:57,405 --> 00:19:01,285
Speaker 6:  R one in that like you tell it to do something and then it's, you see it

288
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:04,525
Speaker 6:  clicking through the Geico website and I asked you, but

289
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,805
Speaker 1:  It's actually doing it on your phone.

290
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah. As far as I understand. Yeah.

291
00:19:10,445 --> 00:19:14,365
Speaker 6:  I asked the question of like, is this doing this for me? Is it on

292
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:18,365
Speaker 6:  a computer somewhere else? And I'm, I'm not a hundred

293
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,165
Speaker 6:  percent clear on it, but sure. Saw it all happen.

294
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:25,405
Speaker 6:  It answered the question. It was like, how much do you commute every day?

295
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:29,365
Speaker 6:  And it, it, the idea is it shows you where it's getting its answers.

296
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:33,685
Speaker 6:  It kind of like shows you its work as you go. So it would like go to

297
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:37,565
Speaker 6:  Google Maps or whatever and be like, you commute 40 miles a day

298
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:41,205
Speaker 6:  or whatever it is and then went through and paid for the insurance

299
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:43,485
Speaker 6:  policy and they were like, we need to go cancel this now.

300
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:44,685
Speaker 1:  Oh my gosh.

301
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:49,245
Speaker 6:  It was wild. Like I, I just don't even, I

302
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:53,085
Speaker 6:  saw it with my own eyes. I'm like, I have a hard time believing this.

303
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:57,125
Speaker 6:  Like, so yeah, it was, it was one of the,

304
00:19:57,225 --> 00:19:59,045
Speaker 6:  the wilder things at the shell. I think

305
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:03,245
Speaker 1:  There are two parts of that that I find incredibly interesting and

306
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:07,085
Speaker 1:  one of them I also find incredibly weird. The one is, I actually

307
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,245
Speaker 1:  think the idea of like having you train your own assistant by going and

308
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:15,085
Speaker 1:  doing the, the various exports from all the other apps is actually very clever.

309
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:19,405
Speaker 1:  Total privacy nightmare. Yeah. But in terms of like, If you wanna sort of

310
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:23,485
Speaker 1:  s solve the cold start problem of how do you train an ai if you're willing

311
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:27,245
Speaker 1:  to do that, that's actually like an incredibly smart way to do that

312
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:31,405
Speaker 1:  is just go ingest all the algorithms from all your social platforms and

313
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:35,565
Speaker 1:  let them just go to work again. Don't do that.

314
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:38,965
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But if you're going to, it's a pretty smart way to do it. The thing

315
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:42,765
Speaker 1:  that I don't understand is, is why this company decided that what I want

316
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,965
Speaker 1:  when I summon my virtual assistant is me. Yes. Staring at

317
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,485
Speaker 1:  me doing this. That's like, it seems so

318
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:53,085
Speaker 6:  Weird to me. I know. Yeah. It it, I would feel awkward

319
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,885
Speaker 6:  looking at myself on my phone. Like,

320
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:00,765
Speaker 6:  am I bothering you? Were you doing something important? Yeah. I

321
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:03,085
Speaker 1:  Dunno, Dom, did you get to try this thing? I

322
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:06,885
Speaker 7:  Did not. I I am kind of sad now that I didn't get to see some tiny

323
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:10,565
Speaker 7:  terrifying Allison. Did you, did you get to see a tiny AI Allison?

324
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,045
Speaker 7:  Did they make one for you?

325
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:16,525
Speaker 6:  No, no, but they're, they say they're shipping

326
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:19,285
Speaker 6:  this thing, it's gonna go on sale in May. It's like

327
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:20,645
Speaker 6:  $375

328
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:26,845
Speaker 6:  and then, then it's going, they said two months After that it's gonna be

329
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:30,725
Speaker 6:  a product that ships in the wild people have and they're training their own

330
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:33,685
Speaker 6:  ais on. So I don't know, it may not be long.

331
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:38,205
Speaker 1:  I'm gonna go ahead and bet the over on the release date on that one. Yeah,

332
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,405
Speaker 1:  may, May 1st I'm gonna guess is gonna come and go. But hey, I hope

333
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:44,245
Speaker 1:  I'm wrong on this one.

334
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:48,155
Speaker 1:  Dom, you saw a bunch of other

335
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:53,515
Speaker 1:  weird phones with weird ideas about things on the back is I guess how I would,

336
00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:57,235
Speaker 1:  I would say it including one I think the company was, was

337
00:21:57,445 --> 00:22:00,635
Speaker 1:  Nubia, is that right? You found a phone with like a, with a, a

338
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:05,155
Speaker 1:  scrolly circular dial on the back? Yes. I love a good

339
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:07,515
Speaker 1:  circular dial, but I don't understand what this thing is doing

340
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,995
Speaker 7:  It. Sovia is part of zte. They're the company that make the Red Magic gaming

341
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:14,715
Speaker 7:  phones as well that people may be more familiar with. That's kind of the

342
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:18,275
Speaker 7:  biggest brand. And yeah, they, they, they announced

343
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,435
Speaker 7:  absolute ton of devices this year and they had a few really weird ones. I

344
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:26,035
Speaker 7:  think the camera ring was, was the strangest, it was on a, I think it's called

345
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:29,715
Speaker 7:  the Focus two Ultra if I've got that sort of sounds the right way around.

346
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:34,395
Speaker 7:  And it was a very cheap looking mid-range phone, but it just has this round

347
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:38,035
Speaker 7:  camera module with a kind of brass ring around the edge

348
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:41,395
Speaker 7:  that is a rotating crown just like you would get on, you know, like rotating

349
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:44,715
Speaker 7:  crowns or watches or something. So the, the bezel of the camera can rotate.

350
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:49,355
Speaker 7:  The main way they had this set up was just that it works as a zoom dial in

351
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:53,195
Speaker 7:  the camera so you can hold the phone and just with like one finger on the

352
00:22:53,195 --> 00:22:56,955
Speaker 7:  back, just rotate that dial and it zooms in and out. So it's a bit more

353
00:22:56,955 --> 00:23:00,835
Speaker 7:  natural than the sort of clunky pinch to zoom or swipe to zoom that you

354
00:23:00,835 --> 00:23:03,915
Speaker 7:  tend to have on phones these days, which work fine, but they're slightly

355
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:07,355
Speaker 7:  awkward movements. It definitely felt more natural than I thought it would

356
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:10,995
Speaker 7:  to just have my finger resting on the back swiveling this thing, it was a

357
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:14,435
Speaker 7:  very kind of, it was very easy to move it, it had a little bit of a ratchet

358
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,595
Speaker 7:  to it, but not too much and it didn't require a lot of force to move. So

359
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:20,675
Speaker 7:  it was a very kind of quick, easy, smooth rotate this wheel

360
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:24,755
Speaker 7:  and the camera just zoomed in and out. I, I'm not sure If you can actually

361
00:23:24,755 --> 00:23:28,075
Speaker 7:  adapt it. What I hope you could do is customize that to do other stuff either

362
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:31,795
Speaker 7:  within the camera changing like exposure or something would be cool outside

363
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:35,715
Speaker 7:  the camera scrolling by just swiveling this wheel on the back of the phone.

364
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:38,555
Speaker 7:  That's the kind of thing I'd like to see from it. And I'm not sure if that's

365
00:23:38,555 --> 00:23:42,475
Speaker 7:  in there or if that ever will be, but yeah, I, I, I

366
00:23:42,475 --> 00:23:45,325
Speaker 7:  like this, this is a real product. It is actually a thing people can go and

367
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:48,965
Speaker 7:  buy. Definitely not in the US but elsewhere in the world. I think this will

368
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:52,085
Speaker 7:  be real and available and I don't think the phone as a whole like a total

369
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:55,245
Speaker 7:  winner, but this is fun. I I I like that as a concept.

370
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:58,805
Speaker 1:  I'm sort of intrigued by this one 'cause I think like we're, we're definitely

371
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:02,805
Speaker 1:  in the age of wild camera bumps on phones, right? And I like

372
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:07,125
Speaker 1:  everybody's trying to either make them sort

373
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:10,485
Speaker 1:  of the whole aesthetic of the phone. Like that's the pixel idea, right? Is

374
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:14,245
Speaker 1:  like what if the whole look of this thing was the camera bump or

375
00:24:15,235 --> 00:24:17,645
Speaker 1:  just like, pretend they don't exist, which is like what Apple's doing. They're

376
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:19,685
Speaker 1:  like, what camera bump, there's no camera bump. Don't, don't worry about

377
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,205
Speaker 1:  the camera bump. There's no camera bump. You've never seen a camera bump

378
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:25,085
Speaker 1:  in your life. But this I think is very cool 'cause it's like, okay, there

379
00:24:25,145 --> 00:24:29,005
Speaker 1:  is, there is hardware on the back here and you're gonna feel it with

380
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:32,685
Speaker 1:  your finger. And I like the idea of actually making it

381
00:24:33,665 --> 00:24:36,845
Speaker 1:  useful in some way, even honestly if it did nothing, but it was just like

382
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:39,725
Speaker 1:  a little fidgety thing on the back. Yes. There's still something about like,

383
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:43,605
Speaker 1:  you've made this phone more tactile in a way that I actually really, really

384
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:43,845
Speaker 1:  like

385
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:47,725
Speaker 6:  A fidget spinner built into the back of the phone. I love it.

386
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:51,805
Speaker 1:  I mean that's like 60% of what this pop socket on my phone is, is just a

387
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:55,285
Speaker 1:  little fidget spinner. Yeah. And I think that kind of thing. But Dom, I totally

388
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,925
Speaker 1:  agree. Like If you could map that to other stuff on the phone the way that

389
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:02,005
Speaker 1:  you can, like on some phones map the volume buttons to scroll up and down

390
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:05,725
Speaker 1:  or like Yeah. You know, turn pages in the Kindle app or whatever. Like little

391
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,485
Speaker 1:  bits like that I think are very cool and should come back to more smartphones.

392
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:12,765
Speaker 1:  Alison, did you see any other cool phones? I feel like there's a bunch of

393
00:25:12,765 --> 00:25:16,525
Speaker 1:  like the nothing phone seems fine, there's like the the solar

394
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:19,485
Speaker 1:  smartphone concept, but was there anything else that like really jumped out

395
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:20,605
Speaker 1:  to you on the mobile side of things?

396
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:25,285
Speaker 6:  I gotta give a shout out to the coffee phone. I

397
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:29,245
Speaker 6:  dunno. Which was a concept. This was from techno

398
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:33,525
Speaker 6:  and I went over there like techno Chinese brand. They,

399
00:25:33,555 --> 00:25:36,765
Speaker 6:  they had a bunch of concepts on their booth and there's like a trifold,

400
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:41,045
Speaker 6:  they had a slim phone because we're doing slim phones, but

401
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:45,005
Speaker 6:  there's, you could actually like pick up and use, which was cool. So

402
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:48,885
Speaker 6:  I went over there, I was like in line to see the slim phone and I got

403
00:25:48,955 --> 00:25:52,845
Speaker 6:  kind of the rundown on this. They had these like sustainable concepts

404
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:56,405
Speaker 6:  where the back of the phone was made out of like some kind of coconut fiber

405
00:25:56,945 --> 00:26:00,045
Speaker 6:  and the woman showing them to me, she was like, this one is made out of coffee

406
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:03,645
Speaker 6:  grounds and you can smell it and it smells like coffee. And I

407
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,085
Speaker 6:  smelled it and it smells like coffee.

408
00:26:06,795 --> 00:26:09,445
Speaker 1:  Whoa. I know. Is that cool or is that I

409
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:12,885
Speaker 6:  Thought it was horrible as hell. I loved it. I mean,

410
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:17,645
Speaker 6:  standing around me smell the phone, I was like, Julian smell this phone and

411
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:21,805
Speaker 6:  made it my whole personality for the 30 minutes.

412
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:26,725
Speaker 6:  I don't, I dunno. I was like, that's so fun. That's not a thing I'm ever

413
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:30,445
Speaker 6:  gonna be able to buy. But I, so like the most practical

414
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:34,285
Speaker 6:  cool thing I saw I think was at HMD

415
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:38,765
Speaker 6:  they had a whole thing. It was wild. It was at the

416
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:41,125
Speaker 6:  FC Barcelona Stadium.

417
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,725
Speaker 1:  Oh sure, okay. HMD is the company that makes Nokia phones now. Right. That's

418
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:47,525
Speaker 1:  like in the us They're the, they're the Nokia one.

419
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:51,165
Speaker 6:  Yes. Nokia. And they're launch they cell phones as

420
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:54,325
Speaker 6:  HMD now. Okay. Which you, you can actually buy one in the us

421
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:59,045
Speaker 6:  but they have, it's some earbuds that come in this kind of

422
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:02,645
Speaker 6:  rectangular case and it mags safe

423
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:06,885
Speaker 6:  chee twos to the back of a phone and it doubles as a little

424
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:10,925
Speaker 6:  power bank. So it's got like, it's somewhere,

425
00:27:10,955 --> 00:27:14,885
Speaker 6:  it's like 1300 milliamps or something like that. Not huge, but there's

426
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:18,125
Speaker 6:  like more of a battery in it than your typical like

427
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:22,245
Speaker 6:  AirPods case. The earbuds just kind of like pop outta

428
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:26,205
Speaker 6:  the sides. They're real chunky and kind of weird looking I think

429
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:30,005
Speaker 6:  because they need to fit into this case. But I think

430
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:33,925
Speaker 6:  that's genius. Like you, I'm used to charging my AirPods, I'm

431
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:37,645
Speaker 6:  used to carrying those around with me. Wouldn't it be cool if that did something

432
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:41,365
Speaker 6:  else for me? Like if my phone's running outta battery, you just

433
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:45,245
Speaker 6:  slap it on there and you get a little more charge. I was like,

434
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:46,445
Speaker 6:  I love it.

435
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:51,285
Speaker 1:  I a that's a very good idea. And B I'm looking

436
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:54,685
Speaker 1:  at this photo that you took of it now and it kind of looks like you've

437
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:58,965
Speaker 1:  magnified a vape onto the back of your phone. That's

438
00:27:59,115 --> 00:28:03,045
Speaker 6:  Kind look like a vape. Oh no. How many, how far away are we from CHI

439
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:03,805
Speaker 6:  two vape?

440
00:28:04,825 --> 00:28:06,805
Speaker 1:  Not far. Clearly Not far.

441
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,285
Speaker 6:  Oh, it's gonna happen.

442
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:11,205
Speaker 1:  This is come you can vape and charge your phone and also there's headphones

443
00:28:11,205 --> 00:28:15,085
Speaker 1:  inside. It's like that's the, that's how you get the teens onboard with CHE

444
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:15,245
Speaker 1:  two,

445
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:19,485
Speaker 6:  The ultimate multitasker. Oh

446
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,965
Speaker 6:  no. Well thank you for that David.

447
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,965
Speaker 1:  You're welcome. We've really done something here. Okay, so there's one, one

448
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:29,565
Speaker 1:  more gadget I want to ask you about and then I'm just curious to hear

449
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:33,525
Speaker 1:  favorite things from the show and then I'll let you get outta here. This,

450
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:37,725
Speaker 1:  this Nintendo switch looking thing that Samsung made.

451
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:41,965
Speaker 1:  What, what is this thing? I, I feel like this, this was like an image that

452
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:44,245
Speaker 1:  got passed around the internet and people were like, oh my god, what a cool

453
00:28:44,245 --> 00:28:47,645
Speaker 1:  thing that Samsung made. It's like a foldable Nintendo switch. Did you guys

454
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:48,565
Speaker 1:  see this thing? What is this thing?

455
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:52,975
Speaker 6:  Yeah, this was at Samsung display and

456
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:56,415
Speaker 6:  their, their booth is full of concept devices like,

457
00:28:56,805 --> 00:29:00,655
Speaker 6:  like very much like we don't make these things, these are just ideas,

458
00:29:00,835 --> 00:29:04,615
Speaker 6:  aren't they cool? Maybe someone could adapt them and tell them.

459
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:08,895
Speaker 6:  So they had all kinds of stuff, all kinds of folding displays. But

460
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:13,175
Speaker 6:  the coolest one was this gaming handheld that was sort of

461
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:17,215
Speaker 6:  set up with a very small sign that said, you know,

462
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:20,895
Speaker 6:  it was like, do not touch. Everybody wanted to come over and touch it.

463
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:24,895
Speaker 6:  It was, it was like very difficult not to just pick it up and touch it and

464
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:28,855
Speaker 6:  someone would yell at you. But it just, it does what it sounds like.

465
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:32,815
Speaker 6:  It's like a little switch looking thing that folds in half and

466
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:36,575
Speaker 6:  you open it up and play your games and you fold it up when you're done. It's

467
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:40,535
Speaker 6:  green and yellow so it's not a switch, but it's definitely a

468
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:44,125
Speaker 6:  switch. Yeah, I thought it was one of the coolest things. I like

469
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:48,805
Speaker 6:  never travel with the switch because it just kind of seems like that

470
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:52,565
Speaker 6:  bit too bulky. I'm like, what if it folded?

471
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,805
Speaker 6:  Maybe I would take it around then.

472
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:59,485
Speaker 1:  There is something about this that I find like irresistibly cool. I, I don't,

473
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:02,685
Speaker 1:  I don't like, I have no idea what I would use it for or if it would change

474
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,605
Speaker 1:  anything for me or it would just stick a giant crease in the middle of all

475
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:09,285
Speaker 1:  of my video games. Yeah. But like I, it's very cool. Yeah, there's something,

476
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:12,525
Speaker 1:  there's something about it that I'm like, I'm in on all foldables as you

477
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:15,125
Speaker 1:  well know, but this one I'm in on as well. Yeah. Like

478
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:18,965
Speaker 7:  Immediate, immediate appeal. I, I mostly wanted to touch it just

479
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:22,645
Speaker 7:  to try the D pads because the way this is designed is that the

480
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:26,525
Speaker 7:  analog sticks have to go somewhere when it folds. So the D pads are kind

481
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:30,045
Speaker 7:  of just like holes with buttons around the edge so that the analog stick

482
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:33,685
Speaker 7:  can slot into these holes and they look like the worst DPAs

483
00:30:33,795 --> 00:30:37,645
Speaker 7:  ever made. And I'm fascinated to try them just to

484
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:40,685
Speaker 7:  feel what those buttons are like and how that would work to play anything

485
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:40,885
Speaker 7:  on.

486
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:43,645
Speaker 1:  Oh, I hadn't even understood that. Looking at this picture, they're like,

487
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:47,685
Speaker 1:  they're like down sloping buttons so that the stick has somewhere to go

488
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:48,925
Speaker 1:  in the center of them. Yes.

489
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,405
Speaker 7:  On the inside edge of a ring. Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:30:52,235 --> 00:30:55,365
Speaker 1:  Right. Yeah, that's probably not a great idea.

491
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,965
Speaker 1:  Doesn't seem like it's gonna work, but I like it. Alright, before I let you

492
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:03,045
Speaker 1:  guys go, I want you each to tell me just your, your favorite thing that you

493
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:05,525
Speaker 1:  saw. It doesn't have to be real, it doesn't have to be plausible, it doesn't

494
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:08,205
Speaker 1:  have to be a thing you're gonna buy, but what's the thing you saw at MWC

495
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:10,725
Speaker 1:  that you were most like just into

496
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,215
Speaker 1:  for good reasons or for bad dom? You go first.

497
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:19,415
Speaker 7:  For me it is the, the Xiaomi camera concept. That lens that

498
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:23,855
Speaker 7:  magnets onto the back of a phone. I, I agree David. I'm, I'm

499
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:27,535
Speaker 7:  now all in on this. I want this to exist. I say that as someone who's a sucker

500
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,695
Speaker 7:  for the, the Xiaomi photography kit that they have for the ultra phones,

501
00:31:30,945 --> 00:31:34,775
Speaker 7:  which is a little camera grip that has a battery pack and slaps on the side

502
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:37,855
Speaker 7:  and gives you a shutter button and zoom dial and stuff like that. They didn't

503
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,535
Speaker 7:  show those things off together and I'm kind of shocked they didn't have a

504
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:43,895
Speaker 7:  version that had that because then it really is just like a mirrorless camera.

505
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:46,535
Speaker 7:  You pull apart, you pop the lens off, you pull the grip off, now it's your

506
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:49,855
Speaker 7:  phone. You slap those back on and you've got a full-size camera and

507
00:31:50,495 --> 00:31:54,175
Speaker 7:  I love that. It's very cool. I genuinely do see the potential in this.

508
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:58,295
Speaker 7:  I very, very expensive potential I'm sure. But potential, I, I

509
00:31:58,295 --> 00:31:59,895
Speaker 7:  would, I would buy this if it existed.

510
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:03,615
Speaker 1:  I honestly like what If you had a really good camera that had

511
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:07,735
Speaker 1:  Instagram and TikTok installed on it just makes sense to me.

512
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:12,055
Speaker 1:  I just, it just makes sense to me. And I think the answer is probably just

513
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:15,415
Speaker 1:  your smartphone camera is good enough on its own, but like no it's not.

514
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:17,215
Speaker 1:  We can do better.

515
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:21,295
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That's the closest hesitation I have is like the camera is

516
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:24,855
Speaker 7:  almost that good. Right? Like the 15 ultras is such a great camera that you

517
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:27,175
Speaker 7:  almost look at Well when they're doing that well anyway, do they need this

518
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:30,695
Speaker 7:  whole other lens to slap on the back? But yeah, why, why not? Even bigger

519
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:32,495
Speaker 7:  sensors. Even bigger lenses. Let's keep going

520
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:34,935
Speaker 1:  A hundred percent. Alison, what about you? What was your favorite,

521
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:40,285
Speaker 6:  Not to be boring, but like the 15 Ultra I think just that

522
00:32:40,385 --> 00:32:44,205
Speaker 6:  really? Yeah, the like the, the upgrade

523
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:47,965
Speaker 6:  and it's a minor one kind of on a spec page

524
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:52,125
Speaker 6:  is the periscope Zoom is like they, they were

525
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:55,765
Speaker 6:  like, what if we took a telephoto camera on a smartphone and made it good

526
00:32:57,425 --> 00:33:01,085
Speaker 6:  and you're like, wow, that, that would be awesome. And they did it.

527
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:05,125
Speaker 6:  It's like massive and it makes the whole back of the camera look silly.

528
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:09,445
Speaker 6:  But I haven't really tried it out myself. I'm dying to like

529
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:13,485
Speaker 6:  what if a telephoto camera was good Is is such a like

530
00:33:13,485 --> 00:33:17,365
Speaker 6:  radical thought for a phone. You know,

531
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:20,965
Speaker 6:  take, take portraits in inside where

532
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:25,085
Speaker 6:  your subject is moving a little bit and like that might actually

533
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,845
Speaker 6:  work with this phone. I don't know. I'm thrilled. I wanna

534
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:31,205
Speaker 7:  Try it. I also love that the pitch for it isn't what if a telephoto was good

535
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:35,565
Speaker 7:  at at a hundred times Zoom? 'cause we've had that pitch again and again and

536
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:39,525
Speaker 7:  again and again. Yes from Samsung. It's what if the telephoto or periscope

537
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:43,165
Speaker 7:  was good at four times? Like it's just really, really good at four times.

538
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:46,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah and it's great there and it can go up to 120 times and you should never

539
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,485
Speaker 7:  do that. And the photos are awful but they're not pitching it on that. They're

540
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,765
Speaker 7:  not pitching on on the fact that you can shoot a skyscraper from the other

541
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:54,805
Speaker 7:  side of a city. They're just saying like yeah, what If you could shoot something

542
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:57,085
Speaker 7:  on the other side of the room and it would actually be a nice photo that

543
00:33:57,085 --> 00:34:00,245
Speaker 7:  you want to use with bouquet and beautiful colors and all of that.

544
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:01,285
Speaker 6:  Exactly.

545
00:34:01,635 --> 00:34:05,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I love that. And I think the message that Allison and I have been yelling

546
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:08,325
Speaker 1:  into the universe that digital Zoom is not Zoom, it's cropping,

547
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:13,365
Speaker 1:  is finally seems to be giving us some real benefits and they're actually

548
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,525
Speaker 1:  starting to solve this problem. And Allison, I think you and I specifically

549
00:34:16,525 --> 00:34:17,125
Speaker 1:  deserve real credit.

550
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:18,565
Speaker 6:  We didn't. We got the W.

551
00:34:18,745 --> 00:34:22,485
Speaker 1:  We did. I'm proud of us. I also think, by the way, it's very cool to see

552
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:27,445
Speaker 1:  Xmi back to doing like really cool, interesting weird smartphone stuff like

553
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:30,925
Speaker 1:  that company was out in front of so many smartphone trends.

554
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:35,365
Speaker 1:  It was doing the all screen stuff really early. It was doing foldable stuff

555
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,525
Speaker 1:  really early. It's like they've been pushing

556
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:43,085
Speaker 1:  interesting trends kind of out ahead of a lot of companies for a long time.

557
00:34:43,105 --> 00:34:45,845
Speaker 1:  So I think this is the kind of thing that like, it seems weird but might

558
00:34:45,845 --> 00:34:49,485
Speaker 1:  start to pop up other places and Jam's history of doing this

559
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:52,885
Speaker 1:  well and early is pretty strong. So it's, it was cool to see

560
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:57,445
Speaker 1:  Xiaomi like back at the forefront of fun ideas about smartphones, but

561
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:58,205
Speaker 1:  we'll never get to buy them.

562
00:34:58,505 --> 00:34:59,405
Speaker 6:  No we won't.

563
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:02,285
Speaker 1:  Alas Dom, you're gonna have to get all of them and, and we're just gonna

564
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:05,085
Speaker 1:  live vicariously through your experiences with cool phones that we're not

565
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:05,525
Speaker 1:  allowed to have.

566
00:35:05,785 --> 00:35:08,205
Speaker 6:  Can you send me one please? Yeah.

567
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:14,045
Speaker 1:  Awesome. Well thank you both for doing this immediately after flying one

568
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,885
Speaker 1:  of you, not a long time and one of you a very long time, but it's nice to

569
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,845
Speaker 1:  see you both. Thank you for doing this. Yeah, thank you.

570
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:20,685
Speaker 7:  Thank you.

571
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:24,565
Speaker 1:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and talk about

572
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:26,045
Speaker 1:  dig. We'll be right back.

573
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:34,135
Speaker 8:  It's been reported that one in four people experience sensory

574
00:36:04,315 --> 00:36:04,805
Speaker 8:  Burnett

575
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:56,255
Speaker 1:  Welcome back. About a year ago, Kevin Rose and I got on the phone to talk

576
00:37:56,255 --> 00:38:00,135
Speaker 1:  about Dig Back then we were mostly reminiscing The Verge did this big package

577
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:03,455
Speaker 1:  of stories about 2004 and all the tech that happened that year

578
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:07,415
Speaker 1:  and DIG was one of the things that launched in 2004. So we were talking about

579
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:11,455
Speaker 1:  the early days of dig and how community has changed online and how

580
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,895
Speaker 1:  the like button changed everything and on and on. But I asked him at the

581
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:18,655
Speaker 1:  very end of our chat if he'd given any thought to bringing Digg back

582
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:23,055
Speaker 1:  and he kind of said no, but he said no in a way that made it clear. He actually

583
00:38:23,055 --> 00:38:26,815
Speaker 1:  had given it a lot of thought. And it turns out that not that long after

584
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:30,895
Speaker 1:  our conversation, he started to give it a lot of thought. Like a

585
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:34,455
Speaker 1:  lot of thought. And now it's coming back. So dig after,

586
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:38,765
Speaker 1:  I don't know it, it's still technically around, but it's changed a lot over

587
00:38:38,765 --> 00:38:41,965
Speaker 1:  the years and it is definitely not the dig that you remember, If you remember

588
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:45,565
Speaker 1:  the original dig. But now Kevin Rose along with Justin

589
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:49,605
Speaker 1:  Metzel, who's gonna be a CEO at Dig, and people like Alexis Ohanian,

590
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:52,805
Speaker 1:  who's the co-founder of Reddit and is now gonna be an advisor and an investor

591
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:56,365
Speaker 1:  in Dig. The goal is to bring it back and to make a new

592
00:38:56,555 --> 00:39:00,165
Speaker 1:  kind of social network out of it. They have big ideas about how

593
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:03,805
Speaker 1:  AI can make it easier for moderators. They have big ideas about how we can

594
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:07,645
Speaker 1:  do community better. These are people who have learned kind of every lesson

595
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,525
Speaker 1:  there is to learn about social and the internet. And

596
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:15,445
Speaker 1:  their goal is to get it right this time. So originally when I

597
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:18,725
Speaker 1:  talked to Kevin and Justin, I didn't actually intend to use it for the show.

598
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:21,805
Speaker 1:  We were just having kind of a product briefing, but I enjoyed the conversation

599
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:25,645
Speaker 1:  so much that I figured I'd just play it for you here. So this is Kevin

600
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:29,165
Speaker 1:  and Justin and me and we pick up when I essentially asked them

601
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:33,605
Speaker 1:  why now, right? Kevin said he had been approached by

602
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:37,125
Speaker 1:  various owners over the years about whether he wanted to buy the dig domain

603
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,005
Speaker 1:  and buy the website and buy the whole thing back and try it all again. And

604
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:43,125
Speaker 1:  it always said no and the timing was wrong, just didn't feel right. But this

605
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:46,965
Speaker 1:  time it felt right. And so I asked him why and specifically

606
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:50,885
Speaker 1:  what changed between then and now That got you back in.

607
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:52,385
Speaker 1:  Here's what he said.

608
00:39:53,255 --> 00:39:57,155
Speaker 14:  Listen, the, the big obviously we all know that the, the

609
00:39:57,155 --> 00:40:00,795
Speaker 14:  hottest thing to talk about these days is, is ai, right? And and

610
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:01,195
Speaker 14:  when

611
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:03,755
Speaker 1:  We talked about that, when we talked last time that you were like that, that

612
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:07,475
Speaker 1:  might be the thing that makes some of this stuff sort of newly

613
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:07,835
Speaker 1:  possible,

614
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:10,715
Speaker 14:  Right? A and and I think that that is,

615
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:15,435
Speaker 14:  it is, it is a very delicate topic to cover

616
00:40:15,865 --> 00:40:19,835
Speaker 14:  largely because one of the things that I believe that made

617
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:23,795
Speaker 14:  dig and makes Reddit a special place on the internet is that, you know,

618
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:27,595
Speaker 14:  there are humans behind the scenes with real opinions, real, real

619
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:31,195
Speaker 14:  conversation going on, real stories that they find interesting

620
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,955
Speaker 14:  and you don't, the second you start to sterilize

621
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:39,595
Speaker 14:  that, then you're just an aggregator of,

622
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:43,795
Speaker 14:  of information. You're a fancy RSS reader with some voting on it. And it,

623
00:40:43,795 --> 00:40:47,035
Speaker 14:  it's like nobody wants that or thinks that's the future.

624
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:51,835
Speaker 14:  And so if anything, we want to figure out how to reinvent and

625
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,955
Speaker 14:  reimagine what it means to build communities and bring people

626
00:40:56,155 --> 00:41:00,035
Speaker 14:  together. And we see AI as a partner on a,

627
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:03,235
Speaker 14:  a variety of different fronts. But the first front

628
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:07,235
Speaker 14:  that we'll tackle is, is

629
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:12,155
Speaker 14:  very much like how can we remove the janitorial

630
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:15,835
Speaker 14:  work of, you know, moderators and

631
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:19,235
Speaker 14:  community managers and convert what they do every day

632
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:23,355
Speaker 14:  into more of a kind of director of vibes culture

633
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:27,235
Speaker 14:  and, and community builder than someone that is just sitting there

634
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:31,555
Speaker 14:  doing the the laborious, crappy stuff that,

635
00:41:32,335 --> 00:41:35,645
Speaker 14:  you know, comes in through, through the front door.

636
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:40,205
Speaker 14:  And that's a lot of tooling that needs to be built in. And

637
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:43,565
Speaker 14:  we did some pressure testing there to see, you know,

638
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,405
Speaker 14:  what different models are out there, how they handle different types of

639
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:49,165
Speaker 14:  content, how we can surface that stuff,

640
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,965
Speaker 14:  what kind of knobs and dials can we expose to different moderators and

641
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:58,805
Speaker 14:  different community managers so that, you know, they're able

642
00:41:58,805 --> 00:42:02,445
Speaker 14:  to have a more honed and completely transparent,

643
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:06,645
Speaker 14:  you know, version of what they're building. And, and I I am speaking to

644
00:42:06,645 --> 00:42:09,645
Speaker 14:  the future a bit and not all this will be there on day one. That

645
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:13,525
Speaker 1:  Strikes me as the kind of thing in sort of broad strokes that a lot of these

646
00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:17,485
Speaker 1:  LLMs are actually like really well set up to be good at. Yes. In a way that

647
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:19,725
Speaker 1:  I feel like a lot of people tell me things that I'm like maybe in a decade

648
00:42:20,155 --> 00:42:23,845
Speaker 1:  LLMs will be able to do that. This one where it's like basic kind of content

649
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:27,565
Speaker 1:  understanding and sorting and shuffling is like

650
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:31,645
Speaker 1:  actually pretty well within the Realme of what a lot of this stuff can do,

651
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:32,525
Speaker 1:  right? Yeah.

652
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:36,245
Speaker 14:  That that's exactly right. And and also just, you know,

653
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:40,565
Speaker 14:  these, these models can also be discreetly defined and there

654
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:44,245
Speaker 14:  could be multiple agents working on your behalf. So

655
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:48,605
Speaker 14:  we very much see a world where, you know, and I'm just making

656
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:52,365
Speaker 14:  stuff up here for the sake of whatever, for random banter, but

657
00:42:52,635 --> 00:42:56,045
Speaker 14:  there's everything from an AI agent that that converts your entire

658
00:42:56,045 --> 00:42:59,885
Speaker 14:  sub-community into clinging on. And you know, there's another

659
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:03,925
Speaker 14:  one that, you know, you have a meditation group and you don't allow

660
00:43:03,965 --> 00:43:07,485
Speaker 14:  a certain type of profanity and that's, you know, automatically auto

661
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:11,245
Speaker 14:  moderated, right? If and or at the very

662
00:43:11,245 --> 00:43:15,005
Speaker 14:  extreme end. And I think this is something that, you know, without giving

663
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:18,925
Speaker 14:  away too much, you'll see down the road. But you know, I I

664
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:22,565
Speaker 14:  think of dig less like rebuilding a content management platform

665
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:26,405
Speaker 14:  and more like creating the next version of Figma. Like it's almost like

666
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:30,285
Speaker 14:  akin to the shift from Photoshop to Figma where you went

667
00:43:30,315 --> 00:43:34,125
Speaker 14:  from, I'm defining the pixels as a 800 by

668
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:37,405
Speaker 14:  800 square and as by file new

669
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:41,365
Speaker 14:  to a, I have a blank canvas and I'm just going to allow the

670
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:45,365
Speaker 14:  dynamic rearrangement of information

671
00:43:45,785 --> 00:43:49,605
Speaker 14:  in a very flexible way as driven by multiple members of the

672
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:53,165
Speaker 14:  community. So if we can create more of a dynamic canvas

673
00:43:53,415 --> 00:43:56,685
Speaker 14:  where, you know, agents are layered on top of that

674
00:43:57,425 --> 00:44:01,205
Speaker 14:  to assist, to help, to do wild things, to create games,

675
00:44:01,425 --> 00:44:04,525
Speaker 14:  to do whatever they want that that community wants them to do,

676
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:09,245
Speaker 14:  then we have something and we have the ability to wake up one morning and

677
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:12,885
Speaker 14:  be completely surprised by what, you know, our

678
00:44:13,245 --> 00:44:17,205
Speaker 14:  audiences create. And I think that marching towards that end goal is,

679
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:19,525
Speaker 14:  is gonna be a wild ride. You know,

680
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:23,965
Speaker 1:  That's a really fun way to think about it. That's also like huge, right?

681
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:27,685
Speaker 1:  Like what you just described is you could be sort of anything up to and including

682
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:29,045
Speaker 1:  like the whole internet.

683
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:32,645
Speaker 14:  Yeah. I mean If you think about it, it's like

684
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:37,275
Speaker 14:  forms have been, and conversation has been such a

685
00:44:37,715 --> 00:44:41,435
Speaker 14:  a, a kind of like as defined by CSS kinda world.

686
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:45,435
Speaker 14:  Totally. And and it's like those things get updated or refreshed

687
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:48,635
Speaker 14:  or changed, you know, whatever, once every few years

688
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:53,155
Speaker 14:  by the platform owner or you know, you install a new WordPress

689
00:44:53,165 --> 00:44:57,035
Speaker 14:  theme or whatever it may be, right? But you know, if I'm in a,

690
00:44:57,635 --> 00:45:01,555
Speaker 14:  a eventual later sub community on dig that's about stocks,

691
00:45:02,615 --> 00:45:06,275
Speaker 14:  you know, and I want a realtime stock taker, I should just ask my bot to

692
00:45:06,275 --> 00:45:09,235
Speaker 14:  go make one and drop it in there for me. You know, it's like

693
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:13,995
Speaker 14:  that's all gonna be possible, right? And, and, and, and that kind

694
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:17,755
Speaker 14:  of flexibility and malleability of, of a future version of Dig

695
00:45:17,975 --> 00:45:21,955
Speaker 14:  is what ultimately gets us really, really jazzed and excited.

696
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:26,115
Speaker 14:  And the thing that Alexis has said about Justin is

697
00:45:26,115 --> 00:45:29,635
Speaker 14:  that, you know, and it's very clear and that I know this quite well in working

698
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:33,475
Speaker 14:  with them, is that you need somebody running these social platforms with

699
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:37,595
Speaker 14:  a high degree of integrity and someone that's always going to point to that

700
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:41,555
Speaker 14:  North Star and say the community eats first. This is all about the

701
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:45,315
Speaker 14:  community. This is all about the likes. Like serving those people and

702
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:49,435
Speaker 14:  creating the best possible experience for them. Because from

703
00:45:49,435 --> 00:45:53,115
Speaker 14:  my point of view in watching all the rebellion that happened

704
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:56,995
Speaker 14:  against DIG and the rebellion that's happened multiple times on Reddit,

705
00:45:58,115 --> 00:46:01,965
Speaker 14:  largely a lot of that is driven by those people that put

706
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:05,365
Speaker 14:  in so many hours of their life as being,

707
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:09,285
Speaker 14:  you know, treated as second class citizens and not really,

708
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:14,005
Speaker 14:  you know, being taken their needs being taken seriously. And so, you

709
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:17,365
Speaker 14:  know, one of the first things I did when even before buying Dig, is I went

710
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:21,245
Speaker 14:  out and personally bought thousands of dollars of Reddit ads and I

711
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:25,405
Speaker 14:  targeted all of the moderation communities and I

712
00:46:25,465 --> 00:46:29,445
Speaker 14:  put in forms, some

713
00:46:29,445 --> 00:46:32,325
Speaker 14:  of them targeted, some of them open-ended questions asking

714
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:36,765
Speaker 14:  moderators what they were missing were their pain points,

715
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:40,685
Speaker 14:  were they struggling? What do they wish existed that isn't being

716
00:46:40,685 --> 00:46:44,245
Speaker 14:  built for them? And I got thousands of responses that

717
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:48,285
Speaker 14:  of course I dumped into AI and, and themes started to

718
00:46:48,285 --> 00:46:51,925
Speaker 14:  emerge. And it's, and it's that level of

719
00:46:51,925 --> 00:46:54,925
Speaker 14:  attention that we need to be giving these people and helping them build

720
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:58,525
Speaker 14:  the tools so that the back office and the suite of tools that they have

721
00:46:59,135 --> 00:47:03,005
Speaker 14:  looks as good as the front does. And that's just never been done.

722
00:47:03,105 --> 00:47:04,725
Speaker 14:  And that's something that's on us to build.

723
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:08,965
Speaker 1:  Totally. And it's interesting to hear you talk about paying attention to

724
00:47:08,965 --> 00:47:12,165
Speaker 1:  the community as paying attention to the moderators, which I think is like,

725
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:15,965
Speaker 1:  like I spent a bunch of time with Reddit mods during not this most recent

726
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:21,045
Speaker 1:  Reddit mod revolt, but the one before that it's like every, every

727
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:23,965
Speaker 1:  two years this happens all over again. And the thing they were saying is

728
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:26,445
Speaker 1:  like, Reddit actually takes pretty good care of its users and horrible care

729
00:47:26,445 --> 00:47:29,005
Speaker 1:  of the moderators who are the ones who actually spend all of their time taking

730
00:47:29,045 --> 00:47:32,845
Speaker 1:  care of their users. And they really felt that, and they were like, the reason

731
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:35,925
Speaker 1:  our users have a good time is not because of Reddit, it's 'cause of us. And

732
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:40,285
Speaker 1:  like appreciating that the middleman there, I think is, is a hard thing

733
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:43,645
Speaker 1:  to do because you, most people don't notice it. But I think it ends up kind

734
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:45,605
Speaker 1:  of being the job in a lot of ways.

735
00:47:45,925 --> 00:47:49,325
Speaker 14:  I mean, I, I wholeheartedly agree with that. And then I also think that

736
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:53,965
Speaker 14:  we can, it's not just about building them good tools, but it's also about

737
00:47:53,965 --> 00:47:57,805
Speaker 14:  giving them agency in a way that they haven't had before. Hmm. And

738
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,715
Speaker 14:  what I mean by that is like, it just like, it's a real

739
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:05,475
Speaker 14:  bummer to me as a, as a creator, like if I step outside of the Dig Realme

740
00:48:05,475 --> 00:48:09,275
Speaker 14:  for a minute and I say like, listen, like a, a good example

741
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:12,675
Speaker 14:  is like, you know, I own my email newsletter list, right?

742
00:48:13,495 --> 00:48:17,075
Speaker 14:  And in some sense, until they take it away, I can

743
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:20,555
Speaker 14:  export all of my Twitter data and take it with me, right? Like,

744
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:26,055
Speaker 14:  how do we make sure that if a community comes

745
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:29,695
Speaker 14:  along and they want to have a deeper, more real connection with these people,

746
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:32,815
Speaker 14:  that they spend so much time building up these communities.

747
00:48:33,405 --> 00:48:36,735
Speaker 14:  Like it's not all for nothing. It's not like just some big corporate entity,

748
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:40,775
Speaker 14:  you know, controls that. So we think deeply about

749
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:45,295
Speaker 14:  these questions on how we can give them more real ownership

750
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:49,495
Speaker 14:  and all the things that we build and do versus just making them

751
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:51,375
Speaker 14:  unpaid, you know,

752
00:48:53,355 --> 00:48:55,905
Speaker 14:  moderators that, that don't get a lot of recognition, you know?

753
00:48:56,215 --> 00:48:59,465
Speaker 15:  Well, and I think the thing that was really interesting as we've even thought

754
00:48:59,465 --> 00:49:02,745
Speaker 15:  about it was it was like, it's like that question you can ask like, what

755
00:49:02,745 --> 00:49:06,225
Speaker 15:  would I do different if I was to do something like this again?

756
00:49:06,885 --> 00:49:10,705
Speaker 15:  And having both Kevin and Alexis with their own stories,

757
00:49:10,705 --> 00:49:13,905
Speaker 15:  their own paths that each of these things have taken. I mean, it feels like

758
00:49:13,905 --> 00:49:17,745
Speaker 15:  I have the game guide to like look at and and, and play really well from

759
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:20,585
Speaker 15:  the beginning and I know where the secrets are. I know I, I know where to

760
00:49:20,585 --> 00:49:24,025
Speaker 15:  look. And, and again, that doesn't mean that every single thing is super

761
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:27,825
Speaker 15:  clear. And, but that's mostly because both, you know, Kevin, myself and

762
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:31,785
Speaker 15:  Alexis very much value human-centered design. We want the community

763
00:49:31,785 --> 00:49:35,585
Speaker 15:  to dictate a lot of these things. But the difference was like, how do we

764
00:49:35,585 --> 00:49:39,385
Speaker 15:  square up from day one to let them know that it's like this is a

765
00:49:39,385 --> 00:49:42,945
Speaker 15:  place for people to gather for communities. And we recognize

766
00:49:43,535 --> 00:49:47,225
Speaker 15:  that people are able to gather when people catalyze and,

767
00:49:47,325 --> 00:49:51,265
Speaker 15:  and like make it happen by building communities online. And I think it's

768
00:49:51,415 --> 00:49:54,465
Speaker 15:  even more important now that we think about those things and how it's working

769
00:49:54,465 --> 00:49:55,585
Speaker 15:  and how to do it in a healthy way.

770
00:49:56,085 --> 00:49:59,865
Speaker 1:  What's your sense of what you're kind of wading into with that conversation?

771
00:49:59,945 --> 00:50:03,905
Speaker 1:  Because on the one hand I feel like there is more need for that than

772
00:50:03,905 --> 00:50:07,625
Speaker 1:  ever and people are really aware of kind of how important community is,

773
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,785
Speaker 1:  but also we've spent most of the last decade just being

774
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:15,105
Speaker 1:  burned by that over and over and over and every different way. So I feel

775
00:50:15,105 --> 00:50:18,865
Speaker 1:  like you're gonna run into a group of people who both desperately want what

776
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:22,665
Speaker 1:  you're talking about and are also more skeptical every day

777
00:50:22,845 --> 00:50:26,625
Speaker 1:  of whether you will actually do it and deliver it to them in the long run.

778
00:50:27,035 --> 00:50:30,485
Speaker 15:  Well it's, it's a balance because it's like a lot of, you know, modern social

779
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:33,645
Speaker 15:  media with the algorithm. Like, it's like outrage culture. It's just like

780
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:36,685
Speaker 15:  what can we serve you that is so counter to

781
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:41,085
Speaker 15:  what you believe that you'll see it and you'll just like want to throw your

782
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:44,885
Speaker 15:  your phone across the room. And so it's like, one of the things we have

783
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:48,365
Speaker 15:  talked about is like, how do we, obviously we're gonna use

784
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,885
Speaker 15:  AI to be able to make things more efficient. And hopefully that means there's

785
00:50:52,085 --> 00:50:55,125
Speaker 15:  relevancy service there and there's, there's interest that you have and

786
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:58,285
Speaker 15:  the, and the spaces that you follow, and we can, you know, branch out from

787
00:50:58,285 --> 00:51:01,685
Speaker 15:  there to grow some of those things. But like, there has to be a balance

788
00:51:01,685 --> 00:51:05,245
Speaker 15:  where it's like, instead of doing it behind closed doors, or, you know,

789
00:51:05,385 --> 00:51:08,325
Speaker 15:  really just saying, well, if you're mad, you're gonna click a lot more.

790
00:51:08,385 --> 00:51:12,045
Speaker 15:  So let's just get everybody really mad. We can really start

791
00:51:12,045 --> 00:51:15,645
Speaker 15:  thinking about like, how do we get people into communities as the first,

792
00:51:15,785 --> 00:51:19,005
Speaker 15:  but then also like when you're in there, like what does it mean to show

793
00:51:19,005 --> 00:51:22,245
Speaker 15:  up in a community? Like, like who are you in that community? You'll have

794
00:51:22,485 --> 00:51:25,685
Speaker 15:  people that post content, like post original content. You're gonna have

795
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:29,445
Speaker 15:  people that make comments and they're, they're funny and they're, and they're

796
00:51:29,445 --> 00:51:31,885
Speaker 15:  enjoyable. You have people obviously that make other kinds of comments and

797
00:51:31,885 --> 00:51:35,645
Speaker 15:  those people exist too. But it's like, you also have people that like,

798
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,965
Speaker 15:  just support other things. They're not the ones finding the stuff, but they're

799
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:42,085
Speaker 15:  up voting it and they're, they're, they're sourcing, you know, from like

800
00:51:42,085 --> 00:51:45,165
Speaker 15:  the earliest stuff. How do we get that to the top here? And those people

801
00:51:45,165 --> 00:51:48,445
Speaker 15:  deserve to be celebrated as well. So one of the things that Kevin and I

802
00:51:48,445 --> 00:51:51,485
Speaker 15:  talked about from the beginning is like, you know, there's like all these

803
00:51:51,835 --> 00:51:55,045
Speaker 15:  very simple, you know, systems that we already have for like, commenting

804
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,885
Speaker 15:  systems and branching and all that stuff. But it's like, even if

805
00:51:58,945 --> 00:52:02,885
Speaker 15:  we start there, we cannot stop asking the question about how to like,

806
00:52:03,475 --> 00:52:07,405
Speaker 15:  give people the respect for being really insightful, for being

807
00:52:07,405 --> 00:52:11,205
Speaker 15:  really encouraging, for being really funny at times or just even saying

808
00:52:11,205 --> 00:52:13,805
Speaker 15:  like, Hey, this isn't really adding to the conversation. And maybe that's

809
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:17,685
Speaker 15:  okay and people do need to see that a bit. So I think for us, it really

810
00:52:17,945 --> 00:52:21,645
Speaker 15:  is just about when people create communities, they should have control on

811
00:52:21,915 --> 00:52:25,125
Speaker 15:  what kind of community they're looking to create. It should be efficient

812
00:52:25,185 --> 00:52:28,965
Speaker 15:  and easy, and it should be something that like other people have a real

813
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:31,365
Speaker 15:  understanding of like, what does it mean to show up here? What are we talking

814
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:33,645
Speaker 15:  about? What are we sharing and how are we doing it? Hmm.

815
00:52:33,795 --> 00:52:37,605
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And I think just adding on top of that, the, the one thing

816
00:52:37,605 --> 00:52:41,525
Speaker 14:  that you'll see, you know, and, and I

817
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:45,125
Speaker 14:  think this is important to, to hit in, in, in, in, in Hit Home with you

818
00:52:45,145 --> 00:52:49,085
Speaker 14:  is that, you know, dig Day one is very much our, like MVP,

819
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:52,925
Speaker 14:  let's just ship this. Lots of lots of bugs, lots of broken things,

820
00:52:52,925 --> 00:52:55,965
Speaker 14:  like we're rushing this out, we're gonna get it out, but we're gonna fast

821
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:59,205
Speaker 14:  fall that every couple weeks with just like, just new stuff all the time.

822
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:03,205
Speaker 14:  So when we get there, what you'll see that

823
00:53:03,345 --> 00:53:07,125
Speaker 14:  is a radical transparency that you'll see you won't have seen anywhere else.

824
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:11,725
Speaker 14:  There will be no such thing as Shadow banning. You will see a full

825
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,525
Speaker 14:  audit log of what's happening to who and

826
00:53:15,665 --> 00:53:19,325
Speaker 14:  why. And I think this is where, you know,

827
00:53:20,185 --> 00:53:24,125
Speaker 14:  we can kind of lean on AI to be a helpful participant here

828
00:53:24,345 --> 00:53:27,965
Speaker 14:  in that there's, there's a couple different ways you can imagine this. You

829
00:53:27,965 --> 00:53:31,845
Speaker 14:  can say, okay, I'm a I'm a community manager and I run

830
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:35,445
Speaker 14:  this community. I generally want this type

831
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:39,485
Speaker 14:  of conversation to be happen

832
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:43,205
Speaker 14:  here, and I wanna disallow this type of conversation. Okay. Those rules

833
00:53:43,505 --> 00:53:47,405
Speaker 14:  are written and available for everyone. You can see when

834
00:53:47,705 --> 00:53:50,325
Speaker 14:  AI takes action to enforce some of those rules.

835
00:53:51,505 --> 00:53:55,205
Speaker 14:  And If you even feel like it, you can add an extra

836
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:58,805
Speaker 14:  agent on top of that, that grades the

837
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,765
Speaker 14:  moderator's own actions and says, I agreed or disagreed with what this

838
00:54:02,765 --> 00:54:06,645
Speaker 14:  moderator actually did. Right. And so there's layers of this

839
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:11,205
Speaker 14:  in a transparency that I think a lot of the people

840
00:54:11,205 --> 00:54:14,445
Speaker 14:  that are very skeptical of these secret algorithms that

841
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:18,645
Speaker 14:  promote agendas or do different things, I, I think they're really gonna

842
00:54:18,815 --> 00:54:19,685
Speaker 14:  enjoy seeing

843
00:54:21,515 --> 00:54:24,925
Speaker 14:  that audit trail and exactly what's happening behind the scenes

844
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:28,805
Speaker 14:  because we just think that's such an important piece of trust here

845
00:54:29,345 --> 00:54:33,165
Speaker 14:  is to, to let them know that one, be very clear

846
00:54:33,165 --> 00:54:36,925
Speaker 14:  about how to show up. But two, when action does happen, which ultimately

847
00:54:36,925 --> 00:54:40,525
Speaker 14:  when you get to tens of millions of people all playing in the same sandbox,

848
00:54:40,975 --> 00:54:41,765
Speaker 14:  there will be

849
00:54:43,415 --> 00:54:47,085
Speaker 14:  being very transparent about wh why and how these these things happened.

850
00:54:47,145 --> 00:54:48,085
Speaker 14:  You know? Yeah.

851
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:51,525
Speaker 1:  It just seemed like part of what you're gonna have to figure out how to square

852
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:55,805
Speaker 1:  is making something that is very fun and interesting and exciting to

853
00:54:55,805 --> 00:54:59,205
Speaker 1:  be part of, but isn't like a game to be won. Yes. And I think

854
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:03,565
Speaker 1:  a lot of the mistakes dig made in its first iteration, and Kevin, you and

855
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:05,965
Speaker 1:  I talked about this too, is like, dig kind of became a game you could win.

856
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:10,245
Speaker 1:  And so people figured out how to win it and win it, even with

857
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:12,925
Speaker 1:  things that shouldn't have won it. And it's just starts to become this impossible,

858
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:16,565
Speaker 1:  like SEO spiral into madness and bad content.

859
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,405
Speaker 1:  That's right. And I feel like that's a, that just strikes me as a really

860
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:23,565
Speaker 1:  tricky but important thing to get right? Like, this has to be fun, but you

861
00:55:23,565 --> 00:55:26,405
Speaker 1:  can't win at it. And I feel like the internet doesn't have that much of that

862
00:55:26,405 --> 00:55:28,165
Speaker 1:  right now. Everybody's trying to win on the

863
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:30,525
Speaker 14:  Internet. That's right. And we, we think deeply about this and I I think

864
00:55:30,525 --> 00:55:34,205
Speaker 14:  you'll notice this, I don't want to get into unreleased features,

865
00:55:34,545 --> 00:55:38,405
Speaker 14:  but on day one you'll, you'll notice a couple of very obvious things

866
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,405
Speaker 14:  that on user profiles that you've never seen before,

867
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:45,325
Speaker 14:  there's, well, we might as well just like say it 'cause it'll come out when

868
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:48,245
Speaker 14:  it comes out. But like there's no such thing as following in, in dig. Hmm.

869
00:55:48,585 --> 00:55:52,325
Speaker 14:  And we've, we've replaced some of the core what have been

870
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:56,525
Speaker 14:  considered to be quote unquote vanity metrics in the past, which with what

871
00:55:56,525 --> 00:55:59,445
Speaker 14:  we believe to be our first attempt at things that are much more tangible

872
00:55:59,665 --> 00:56:03,565
Speaker 14:  and real and inspire you to do positive things

873
00:56:03,565 --> 00:56:06,965
Speaker 14:  inside of the ecosystem versus a game that's just one

874
00:56:07,705 --> 00:56:11,365
Speaker 14:  versus who's got the biggest follower account. And

875
00:56:11,665 --> 00:56:15,005
Speaker 14:  that's what we're really excited to, to continue to tweak after we get it

876
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:15,285
Speaker 14:  out there.

877
00:56:15,825 --> 00:56:19,765
Speaker 1:  Man, If you can fix the social metric thing, you, you will have done

878
00:56:19,765 --> 00:56:23,565
Speaker 1:  the internet a great service. Yeah. Like truly we, we don't have a thing

879
00:56:23,565 --> 00:56:26,245
Speaker 1:  that's better than likes and followers and I know Yes. Both of those are

880
00:56:26,245 --> 00:56:26,445
Speaker 1:  bad.

881
00:56:26,785 --> 00:56:30,445
Speaker 14:  Yes. And, and we've, we that's, you know, going back to Justin's point,

882
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:34,525
Speaker 14:  like when you, If you were a fly on the wall and the, the Alexis,

883
00:56:34,575 --> 00:56:38,525
Speaker 14:  Kevin Justin Hangout space, yes there are the,

884
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:42,005
Speaker 14:  the the kind of table stakes like lessons learned, stuff that we need to

885
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:45,565
Speaker 14:  pay attention to and are just going to continue to hold true today from

886
00:56:45,565 --> 00:56:48,805
Speaker 14:  the past. But a lot of it is like, okay,

887
00:56:49,215 --> 00:56:52,125
Speaker 14:  screw what we know to be true. Let's go back to first principles. If we

888
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:55,605
Speaker 14:  were designing this from today, let's just, ima imagine a world where

889
00:56:56,375 --> 00:57:00,205
Speaker 14:  let's let's challenge all these assumptions that we had previously

890
00:57:00,345 --> 00:57:04,165
Speaker 14:  had, not just for the sake of challenging them, but really, truly sit

891
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:07,525
Speaker 14:  with them for a minute and say, what might we do differently? And that's

892
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:09,125
Speaker 14:  led to some really different outcomes already.

893
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:13,845
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's cool. So Justin, I'm particularly curious for, for your

894
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:17,085
Speaker 1:  perspective on like the nostalgia versus newness Yeah. Thing because like

895
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:21,605
Speaker 1:  my sense is like, like you guys are saying, there is a real group of people

896
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,445
Speaker 1:  out there who loves dig and remembers, dig and will care about it and will

897
00:57:24,445 --> 00:57:27,845
Speaker 1:  come back for it. But I feel like that only gets you so far and

898
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:31,325
Speaker 1:  especially in terms of like the product you guys are describing, it sort

899
00:57:31,325 --> 00:57:34,405
Speaker 1:  of rhymes with old dig, but it's very much not old dig. So like, I don't

900
00:57:34,405 --> 00:57:36,485
Speaker 1:  know, how are you thinking about the, the balance of those two things?

901
00:57:37,075 --> 00:57:41,005
Speaker 15:  Yeah, you know, we had a, a different version I think of

902
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:44,885
Speaker 15:  this that was probably a little more of a departure from the dig that people

903
00:57:44,885 --> 00:57:47,885
Speaker 15:  know that we were kind of actively working on as we spun things up earlier

904
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:50,765
Speaker 15:  this year and we were at an offsite together all like doing a hacker house.

905
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:55,245
Speaker 15:  And what I ended up just like waking up one night and I

906
00:57:55,245 --> 00:57:58,765
Speaker 15:  couldn't fall back asleep because I was just like, I am, I

907
00:57:58,895 --> 00:58:02,165
Speaker 15:  don't want to go out the door with a product that is duct taped together

908
00:58:02,275 --> 00:58:05,845
Speaker 15:  that does not feel like an enjoyable space to be in. Of course. But also

909
00:58:05,845 --> 00:58:09,725
Speaker 15:  just like the people who knew dig walk in and they go, oh, digs

910
00:58:09,725 --> 00:58:12,445
Speaker 15:  back. Oh, that's great. You know, and we've seen so many threads on, you

911
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:15,045
Speaker 15:  know, various platforms, people talking about dig and it's always like,

912
00:58:15,045 --> 00:58:17,645
Speaker 15:  oh man, I miss it, it's time to bring it back. And of course just because

913
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:21,125
Speaker 15:  we want to bring surge soda back does not mean surge is as good as we remember.

914
00:58:21,185 --> 00:58:25,165
Speaker 15:  And I get that what we want to do is really build a

915
00:58:25,365 --> 00:58:28,245
Speaker 15:  platform that really works for our modern world that we exist in as well.

916
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:31,845
Speaker 15:  So what we've really done, and at least here in the beginning that you'll

917
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:35,485
Speaker 15:  see is like, there are a lot of things that feel

918
00:58:35,605 --> 00:58:39,445
Speaker 15:  innately like dig and it is a very stripped down experience. This

919
00:58:39,445 --> 00:58:43,285
Speaker 15:  isn't like you can do anything and everything. It's, it's a very tight

920
00:58:43,285 --> 00:58:47,045
Speaker 15:  experience on day one, but the goal is two week iteration release

921
00:58:47,225 --> 00:58:50,365
Speaker 15:  cycles. So it's like discovery and delivery happening in two weeks and going

922
00:58:50,385 --> 00:58:53,725
Speaker 15:  out the door because we have a group that is

923
00:58:54,075 --> 00:58:57,045
Speaker 15:  tenacious, they are really hungry and they're really passionate about what

924
00:58:57,045 --> 00:58:58,085
Speaker 15:  we're building. Okay.

925
00:58:58,085 --> 00:59:00,685
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I mean there's an interesting thing where it's like, I do feel like

926
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:05,365
Speaker 1:  you're gonna get a lot of people who just go to the website because it's

927
00:59:05,365 --> 00:59:07,565
Speaker 1:  dig Absolutely. Right? And that, that is like a very powerful thing to have

928
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:08,165
Speaker 1:  going for you.

929
00:59:09,825 --> 00:59:13,125
Speaker 1:  But it comes with weird expectations, right? Like if it looks like, if it

930
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:16,685
Speaker 1:  looks like it did 20 years ago, that is both good and bad. Yes. In a way

931
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:18,845
Speaker 1:  that is I think, really hard to sort through.

932
00:59:19,315 --> 00:59:23,045
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And, and I think that's, but I don't think it's like we have to throw

933
00:59:23,145 --> 00:59:27,045
Speaker 14:  out all the nostalgia. Like I think, I think it's like, you know, if

934
00:59:27,065 --> 00:59:30,845
Speaker 14:  If you come on day one it's 99.9% nostalgia

935
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:34,085
Speaker 14:  and you're like, damn, this is like a, a slightly updated version of Dig

936
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:34,685
Speaker 14:  that I

937
00:59:34,685 --> 00:59:37,965
Speaker 15:  Can confirm though it's not a skew morphic website. I can confirm that.

938
00:59:38,115 --> 00:59:38,725
Speaker 15:  Okay. That's good.

939
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:43,605
Speaker 14:  That's fair. But, but I, I think that the, you know,

940
00:59:44,305 --> 00:59:47,405
Speaker 14:  the one thing we didn't want to do that Justin's alluding to when he said

941
00:59:47,405 --> 00:59:50,325
Speaker 14:  that he stayed up that one night, 'cause I got the call the next day or

942
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:53,725
Speaker 14:  maybe two days later and he's like, Hey, I just, I just trashed.

943
00:59:53,985 --> 00:59:55,685
Speaker 15:  I'm blowing everything up. I'm blowing everything up.

944
00:59:56,245 --> 00:59:58,885
Speaker 14:  I threw away a bunch of stuff and I was like, okay, let's talk about it.

945
00:59:58,885 --> 01:00:02,805
Speaker 14:  Like what's up? And, and the insight that he had there

946
01:00:02,805 --> 01:00:06,245
Speaker 14:  that I thought was, was super sharp was that, you know,

947
01:00:06,615 --> 01:00:09,725
Speaker 14:  let's get that, let's get that nostalgia bump that we get. We all will know,

948
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:12,565
Speaker 14:  we know we're gonna get on on day one and, and what we can ride that for

949
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:15,365
Speaker 14:  a couple weeks and that trust

950
01:00:16,955 --> 01:00:20,845
Speaker 14:  with any of these communities and, and, and ultimately

951
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:25,045
Speaker 14:  like playing the long game here, it, it's built up week over

952
01:00:25,045 --> 01:00:27,125
Speaker 14:  week, month over month feature over feature.

953
01:00:28,745 --> 01:00:32,285
Speaker 14:  And this is a multi-year adventure for us.

954
01:00:32,995 --> 01:00:36,765
Speaker 14:  This is not something where, you know, Dick's going to eat 50% of

955
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:39,885
Speaker 14:  Reddit's traffic on by the third month. You know what I mean? Like this

956
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:43,845
Speaker 14:  is, this is us being, trying to stay

957
01:00:43,865 --> 01:00:47,645
Speaker 14:  as nimble as possible to have as many different wild shots

958
01:00:47,785 --> 01:00:51,405
Speaker 14:  on goal, all with a very

959
01:00:51,405 --> 01:00:54,685
Speaker 14:  important direct line of communication with the user base so that we're

960
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:58,085
Speaker 14:  listening and, and rolling that into everything that we do.

961
01:00:58,595 --> 01:01:02,285
Speaker 15:  Well the thing too that I, I really do wanna bolt on here is like, I, I

962
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:05,525
Speaker 15:  love what you're saying about like, we're we're gonna get this thing going

963
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:09,325
Speaker 15:  and it will be some of the nostalgia, but like, like at the same time,

964
01:01:09,515 --> 01:01:12,845
Speaker 15:  like the reason why we made that decision was it was like if we

965
01:01:13,035 --> 01:01:16,325
Speaker 15:  brought people back to dig and they were like, man, I just wanna dig back.

966
01:01:16,345 --> 01:01:19,165
Speaker 15:  And then they get it and they're like, oh, this is not what I wanted at

967
01:01:19,225 --> 01:01:22,685
Speaker 15:  all. Like, like, okay, yeah, no, this is a totally new thing now. It's a,

968
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:26,285
Speaker 15:  a chat app or something. That's, that's where we'd feel like we kind of

969
01:01:26,285 --> 01:01:28,885
Speaker 15:  duped just like took the name or like, let's just do whatever we want on

970
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:32,205
Speaker 15:  this thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so the spirit of it, but then on the other

971
01:01:32,205 --> 01:01:36,045
Speaker 15:  side is like, I also don't want, you know, Reddit folks to come

972
01:01:36,045 --> 01:01:39,965
Speaker 15:  over on that first day and just like, okay, so this is like, just like

973
01:01:39,965 --> 01:01:43,685
Speaker 15:  Reddit with worse features, less stuff and less people. And so it's like

974
01:01:43,685 --> 01:01:47,565
Speaker 15:  we really need to like figure out what is the first step that it looks

975
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:51,445
Speaker 15:  like to build dig, and then we'll figure out the rest of the steps

976
01:01:51,445 --> 01:01:52,005
Speaker 15:  from it. Yeah,

977
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:55,205
Speaker 14:  I think it's, I think it's like, you know, this is a horrible analogy Justin

978
01:01:55,355 --> 01:01:58,925
Speaker 14:  come up with something better, but like in my head I'm like, okay, the old

979
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:02,605
Speaker 14:  dig users were used to Photoshop four, we're giving them Photoshop

980
01:02:02,705 --> 01:02:06,605
Speaker 14:  six and in 18 months they'll have Figma, you know, and it's like, okay,

981
01:02:06,715 --> 01:02:10,565
Speaker 14:  it's, it's, it's, it's kind of that world where, and, and we're gonna bring,

982
01:02:10,615 --> 01:02:13,925
Speaker 14:  bring them along every step of the way, right? And so

983
01:02:14,925 --> 01:02:17,425
Speaker 14:  if we would've just dropped Figma on day one, people would've been like,

984
01:02:17,455 --> 01:02:21,445
Speaker 14:  what the hell is this? Right. You know, and, and, and, and

985
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:25,325
Speaker 14:  it, it, it, it's gonna happen not because we're just gonna

986
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,765
Speaker 14:  roll out features that we expect will just work flawlessly.

987
01:02:29,075 --> 01:02:32,005
Speaker 14:  It's gonna happen because we roll back features that didn't work and we

988
01:02:32,005 --> 01:02:34,685
Speaker 14:  roll out the next thing. You know, that's, that's how we're gonna figure

989
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:38,685
Speaker 14:  out this, this whole thing. And, and then the future. It's, it's that

990
01:02:38,785 --> 01:02:42,725
Speaker 14:  it it's that agility that a big competitor won't be able to

991
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:46,005
Speaker 14:  have. And it's the, it's the fact that we've written

992
01:02:46,665 --> 01:02:50,125
Speaker 14:  the backend from scratch in a way that is so nimble

993
01:02:50,665 --> 01:02:54,405
Speaker 14:  it allows for rapid experimentation in a way that a competitor won't have

994
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,565
Speaker 14:  that is gonna give us the edge here.

995
01:02:57,035 --> 01:03:01,005
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. It sure helps to not be a public company in

996
01:03:01,035 --> 01:03:03,965
Speaker 1:  need of giant growth at this particular moment. A hundred percent the social

997
01:03:04,205 --> 01:03:04,285
Speaker 1:  universe.

998
01:03:04,725 --> 01:03:08,485
Speaker 14:  A hundred percent. That's why you, you nailed it. Like we're, you know,

999
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:11,405
Speaker 14:  we don't even have ads on the site. Like there's no, there's no, there's

1000
01:03:11,405 --> 01:03:15,365
Speaker 14:  no plan for ads anytime soon like that. And, and, and if

1001
01:03:15,365 --> 01:03:18,485
Speaker 14:  we do, we're gonna do it in a way that's completely different, you know,

1002
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:22,005
Speaker 14:  and, and we've already got ideas around some of that stuff. But it is worth

1003
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:25,125
Speaker 14:  saying, it's like as we're we're, we're breaking in

1004
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:29,205
Speaker 14:  this new vehicle and we, we booted up and we kind of like, you know,

1005
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:33,165
Speaker 14:  we got that fresh new car smell and everything is like, you know, we're

1006
01:03:33,165 --> 01:03:36,565
Speaker 14:  just trying to make sure like the, the panels are bolted on correctly.

1007
01:03:37,075 --> 01:03:41,005
Speaker 14:  It's gonna be a fixed taxonomy of topics and, and that that'll

1008
01:03:41,005 --> 01:03:44,445
Speaker 14:  be day one. We are gonna very much fast follow that into

1009
01:03:44,615 --> 01:03:48,365
Speaker 14:  open-ended, build your own, whatever you like. And so when

1010
01:03:48,395 --> 01:03:52,325
Speaker 14:  that happens, you know, to your point about smaller

1011
01:03:52,335 --> 01:03:56,165
Speaker 14:  micro communities, If you just care about knitting,

1012
01:03:56,435 --> 01:04:00,215
Speaker 14:  like Damnit, we wanna have the best home for you to go build a community

1013
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:03,855
Speaker 14:  about knitting and you may need very specific things for that community

1014
01:04:03,855 --> 01:04:07,295
Speaker 14:  that we're just not even aware of. Right. But, you know,

1015
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:11,615
Speaker 14:  we wanna make it as flexible term so that you can

1016
01:04:11,855 --> 01:04:14,815
Speaker 14:  describe those things and have those kind of like happen.

1017
01:04:15,635 --> 01:04:19,295
Speaker 14:  So it, it's gonna be a lot of steps to get there. But, but

1018
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:23,295
Speaker 14:  to, to your point about, you know, will there be logged out people that

1019
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,375
Speaker 14:  just come for the homepage 'cause they're like, show me the homepage of

1020
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,175
Speaker 14:  the internet today. Absolutely. Right.

1021
01:04:27,175 --> 01:04:30,215
Speaker 1:  I was just gonna say, you're, you're trying to sort of do both of those things.

1022
01:04:30,315 --> 01:04:34,215
Speaker 1:  You want to have the one sort of shared experience but also let people kind

1023
01:04:34,215 --> 01:04:35,535
Speaker 1:  of define their own inside of

1024
01:04:35,535 --> 01:04:38,735
Speaker 14:  It a hundred percent. It's like if you've got a niche weird thing,

1025
01:04:39,885 --> 01:04:43,815
Speaker 14:  then you, you'll have a a pocket in the home for that that, you know,

1026
01:04:44,095 --> 01:04:47,575
Speaker 14:  I have been into lately into Japanese denim

1027
01:04:47,995 --> 01:04:50,815
Speaker 14:  and I would love to have a community that just talks about that all day

1028
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:54,055
Speaker 14:  long. That would be, I'd, I'd be all about that, right? And so

1029
01:04:54,595 --> 01:04:58,415
Speaker 14:  it, it it is, it is a world where we will get to e embrace and

1030
01:04:58,415 --> 01:05:01,175
Speaker 14:  open it up to, to anything and everything, you know, so

1031
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:04,095
Speaker 1:  Why, why launch this? Now I'm gonna let you guys go here in a minute, but

1032
01:05:04,095 --> 01:05:07,455
Speaker 1:  like to your point, you could sort of build this thing in secret forever

1033
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:11,495
Speaker 1:  or you could just like launch the thing the minute you have a

1034
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:14,975
Speaker 1:  website and say, coming soon and have a wait list. Like why,

1035
01:05:15,435 --> 01:05:16,775
Speaker 1:  why now? Why is this the right moment?

1036
01:05:17,515 --> 01:05:21,285
Speaker 14:  Well, I think, I think it's because it, somebody is, is gonna

1037
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:24,925
Speaker 14:  connect these dots here. A a new startup will connect these dots and that

1038
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:28,365
Speaker 14:  they'll see that we have competition in market right now

1039
01:05:28,915 --> 01:05:32,765
Speaker 14:  that has largely neglected the user

1040
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:35,685
Speaker 14:  base. And I, I'm not just talking about Reddit here, but across the board

1041
01:05:35,715 --> 01:05:39,605
Speaker 14:  that it's been largely driven by, by people that

1042
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:43,645
Speaker 14:  it's a top down development approach and that these are the features you'll

1043
01:05:43,645 --> 01:05:47,405
Speaker 14:  like them and they are what they are and you know,

1044
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:50,645
Speaker 14:  If you don't like it, leave. And I think that

1045
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:54,965
Speaker 14:  we have the ability to flip the script there

1046
01:05:56,345 --> 01:06:00,005
Speaker 14:  and then also it's just the most opportune time to lean

1047
01:06:00,115 --> 01:06:04,085
Speaker 14:  into all these advancements that we're seeing on the technology front. You

1048
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:07,925
Speaker 14:  know, it's like when I built the first version of Dig I was

1049
01:06:08,325 --> 01:06:11,965
Speaker 14:  rack mounting my own servers because AWS didn't exist. That's how

1050
01:06:12,285 --> 01:06:16,005
Speaker 14:  ancient I am. And when AWS came out, I was like,

1051
01:06:16,145 --> 01:06:20,085
Speaker 14:  oh my God, if I had only built it now, how much easier would this have been?

1052
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:23,765
Speaker 14:  Right? And this is another one of those moments where I'm like,

1053
01:06:24,005 --> 01:06:27,325
Speaker 14:  I said, you know, Alexis and I look at each other and, and we, we were like,

1054
01:06:27,325 --> 01:06:31,085
Speaker 14:  oh my God, if now is another one of those moments where

1055
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:31,365
Speaker 14:  it's

1056
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:00,885
Speaker 14:  the light of day and we're like, damn,

1057
01:07:52,825 --> 01:07:54,105
Speaker 16:  brought to you by defender.

1058
01:10:07,205 --> 01:10:09,985
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's get to The Vergecast hotline as always. The

1059
01:10:09,985 --> 01:10:13,945
Speaker 1:  number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. The email is vergecast at The Verge

1060
01:10:14,005 --> 01:10:17,945
Speaker 1:  dot com. Send us all of your questions about everything all the time. That's

1061
01:10:17,945 --> 01:10:21,385
Speaker 1:  just the best thing we do here is try and answer your questions.

1062
01:10:22,065 --> 01:10:25,105
Speaker 1:  Like I mentioned, we have some really fun sort of bigger picture stuff coming

1063
01:10:25,105 --> 01:10:28,585
Speaker 1:  out of hotline questions that I'm very excited about. So stay tuned for that.

1064
01:10:29,005 --> 01:10:31,265
Speaker 1:  For now, we have a question about printers

1065
01:10:33,005 --> 01:10:36,745
Speaker 18:  Bridge cast. It's David from the center

1066
01:10:37,045 --> 01:10:40,795
Speaker 18:  of the United States, again in Missouri. And I'm not

1067
01:10:41,075 --> 01:10:43,875
Speaker 18:  actually sure, I haven't called about this before,

1068
01:10:45,005 --> 01:10:48,825
Speaker 18:  but here's what I need you to do. Before I missed

1069
01:10:48,825 --> 01:10:52,705
Speaker 18:  all this talk about how Apple is declining as

1070
01:10:52,745 --> 01:10:56,705
Speaker 18:  a company, as if it's new. I need you to get Apple to do their

1071
01:10:56,705 --> 01:11:00,105
Speaker 18:  thing, to work their magic on the whole concept

1072
01:11:00,765 --> 01:11:04,595
Speaker 18:  of home printing. I'm not even sure if I have to

1073
01:11:04,595 --> 01:11:07,945
Speaker 18:  explain do I? I feel like they're the only people

1074
01:11:08,845 --> 01:11:11,685
Speaker 18:  who might actually be able to make it

1075
01:11:12,175 --> 01:11:15,645
Speaker 18:  acceptable and not a blight

1076
01:11:16,425 --> 01:11:20,285
Speaker 18:  on the rest of our consumer electronics lives. If anyone's listening

1077
01:11:20,825 --> 01:11:24,365
Speaker 18:  and if not, I need you to make some calls. Thank you.

1078
01:11:25,525 --> 01:11:28,935
Speaker 1:  This is the thing I've actually done a fair amount of research on at this

1079
01:11:28,935 --> 01:11:32,855
Speaker 1:  point. I talked to Cory Dro on the show a while ago about

1080
01:11:32,975 --> 01:11:36,895
Speaker 1:  printers and the mess that is HP and other companies starting

1081
01:11:36,915 --> 01:11:40,855
Speaker 1:  to DRM, the ink so that you can't use third party ink. It's a real

1082
01:11:40,855 --> 01:11:44,215
Speaker 1:  like razor and blades situation where they sell you the thing pretty cheap.

1083
01:11:44,435 --> 01:11:48,055
Speaker 1:  But then the thing you need to actually use the thing is what's expensive

1084
01:11:48,195 --> 01:11:52,135
Speaker 1:  and they lock you in and it's a, it's a crappy business. And the

1085
01:11:52,135 --> 01:11:55,015
Speaker 1:  thing about printers is everybody also hates their printers. So it's not

1086
01:11:55,015 --> 01:11:58,655
Speaker 1:  even like it's a predatory market in which you still get a good product for

1087
01:11:58,655 --> 01:12:02,335
Speaker 1:  too much money. It's a predatory market in which the product sucks.

1088
01:12:03,195 --> 01:12:07,175
Speaker 1:  But here's what I figured out and I think this is just the answer, it's

1089
01:12:07,175 --> 01:12:11,015
Speaker 1:  not an answer I like, but I think it is the answer. There just is no business

1090
01:12:11,355 --> 01:12:15,135
Speaker 1:  in consumer printers as far as I can tell. There is just

1091
01:12:15,235 --> 01:12:19,215
Speaker 1:  simply no way in 2025 for a company to make

1092
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:23,255
Speaker 1:  a very good printer and come with the cost that it

1093
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:27,175
Speaker 1:  would require to make a very good printer that people would buy

1094
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:31,415
Speaker 1:  and that would make any money for the company that made it. I think it's

1095
01:12:31,415 --> 01:12:35,335
Speaker 1:  just that simple. This is why you see that there are super, super expensive

1096
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:38,975
Speaker 1:  printers at the high end of the line and then there are cheap,

1097
01:12:39,345 --> 01:12:43,095
Speaker 1:  awful, crappy printers at the bottom. I think of it a little like the TV

1098
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:46,055
Speaker 1:  market actually, in the sense that there's this

1099
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:50,455
Speaker 1:  high-end world in which you can buy a high-end television for tons of money.

1100
01:12:51,005 --> 01:12:54,775
Speaker 1:  That market, we talk about it a lot, but that market is like this big. The

1101
01:12:54,775 --> 01:12:58,735
Speaker 1:  much bigger market is big, cheap, crappy screens.

1102
01:12:58,755 --> 01:13:02,695
Speaker 1:  That's where we are. And the way that all of those companies make money is

1103
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:05,935
Speaker 1:  not by selling you the television, it's by selling you ads.

1104
01:13:06,525 --> 01:13:09,535
Speaker 1:  It's just the market. Now you get companies like tele who are like, look,

1105
01:13:09,535 --> 01:13:13,215
Speaker 1:  we don't need a dime from the TV because we're gonna make so much money on

1106
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:17,215
Speaker 1:  ads. You get companies like Roku and Amazon that are deep in the TV

1107
01:13:17,615 --> 01:13:20,495
Speaker 1:  business now because it's an advertising business.

1108
01:13:21,435 --> 01:13:24,895
Speaker 1:  TVs are not a hardware business, they're an advertising business. And in

1109
01:13:24,895 --> 01:13:28,855
Speaker 1:  the same way, printers are not a printer business, they're a, they're

1110
01:13:28,855 --> 01:13:32,215
Speaker 1:  an ink business, they're a subscription business, which sucks,

1111
01:13:32,795 --> 01:13:35,375
Speaker 1:  but seems to be the case. And realistically If you think about it, you're

1112
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:39,095
Speaker 1:  like, okay, I hate my printer. Would I pay three times as much for my printer

1113
01:13:39,155 --> 01:13:42,895
Speaker 1:  to be awesome? I think the answer's just no. I think for almost everybody

1114
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:46,295
Speaker 1:  the answer is just no. I've been talking to people about this for a while

1115
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:50,015
Speaker 1:  and that is the only conclusion I have been able to come to. But before we

1116
01:13:50,015 --> 01:13:53,335
Speaker 1:  get out of here, I wanna play you a chunk of an interview that Sean Hollister

1117
01:13:53,335 --> 01:13:57,175
Speaker 1:  and I did with framework CEO, nav Patel for last week's show.

1118
01:13:57,355 --> 01:14:00,775
Speaker 1:  We didn't actually run this clip on the show last week because it didn't

1119
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:03,975
Speaker 1:  really fit the other stuff we were talking about, but one of the things people

1120
01:14:03,975 --> 01:14:07,615
Speaker 1:  always ask framework to make is a printer. It's, it's

1121
01:14:08,055 --> 01:14:10,615
Speaker 1:  a perfectly good idea, right? You want something that's upgradable, that's

1122
01:14:10,615 --> 01:14:13,765
Speaker 1:  repairable that just kind of works that you can fix yourself really easily.

1123
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:17,845
Speaker 1:  Like printer print, just what if somebody made a good printer? So

1124
01:14:17,845 --> 01:14:21,725
Speaker 1:  we asked what would a framework printer look like? And his explanation

1125
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:24,925
Speaker 1:  was really interesting. So before we go, let me just play you this chunk

1126
01:14:24,925 --> 01:14:28,805
Speaker 1:  of our interview. And the reason we are not building a

1127
01:14:29,085 --> 01:14:33,005
Speaker 1:  printer is actually that we haven't identified a plausible

1128
01:14:33,075 --> 01:14:37,005
Speaker 1:  path for us to recoup the investment that we would take for

1129
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:40,645
Speaker 1:  us to build a printer. It's not like a laptop or a desktop

1130
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:44,645
Speaker 1:  where we see that clear path. It's actually very easy for us to recoup the

1131
01:14:44,645 --> 01:14:47,205
Speaker 1:  investments we're making in these products. We actually, you know, easily

1132
01:14:47,235 --> 01:14:51,085
Speaker 1:  have already on the framework laptop. 13, as we look at a

1133
01:14:51,085 --> 01:14:51,285
Speaker 1:  printer,

1134
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:24,665
