26
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,490

37
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,190
Speaker 1:  There's a lot of anti-trust stuff this week. And then Alex Cranz is going

38
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,800
Speaker 1:  to join us for the third segment to show and maybe go through all the other

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Speaker 1:  gadget news that's going on. So a lot going on in the verge cast this week,

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,430
Speaker 1:  I want to start where we start with COVID is always one of the biggest stories

41
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,760
Speaker 1:  in the world. Lots of strange COVID news. This week,

42
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,840
Speaker 1:  Amazon had developed a COVID 19 test for their own

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Speaker 1:  employees and the heart of the pandemic. They were going to release it to

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,140
Speaker 1:  consumers. It went up on the Amazon website where you just order a test from

45
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,100
Speaker 1:  Amazon, which would be a big deal. Now it's gone. We assume it'll come back,

46
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,190
Speaker 1:  but it would have been one of those big deals in the, in the sort of the

47
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,610
Speaker 1:  depths of pandemic, because testing was hard as for chess

48
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,540
Speaker 1:  listeners. Well, no access to testing was a big deal. I

49
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,500
Speaker 1:  think it will continue to be a big deal is a pandemic kind of abs.

50
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,460
Speaker 1:  And the virus becomes more of a seasonal thing. So Amazon having

51
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,850
Speaker 1:  a test it's widely available consumers at big deal. We got to follow up on

52
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,770
Speaker 1:  where went because it's disappeared. There's now a fourth vaccine, a company

53
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,700
Speaker 1:  called Novavax says its vaccine is 90% effective. It's

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,150
Speaker 1:  also two shots, but can be stored at room temperature, which big deal that's

55
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,840
Speaker 1:  good news. And then Nicole Weitzman wrote a pretty interesting story this

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,020
Speaker 1:  week, you know, before the pandemic, big pharma was one of the most

57
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,890
Speaker 1:  reviled industries in America. And after

58
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,070
Speaker 1:  all the vaccine development emphasis there, their popularity has

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,090
Speaker 1:  really skyrocketed. Pfizer was not as

60
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,480
Speaker 1:  popular as it is now several years ago.

61
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,110
Speaker 1:  So kind of a big shift in how we think about pharma, how we think about

62
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,980
Speaker 1:  pharma R and D, which is going to have ripple effects. There's always the

63
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,550
Speaker 1:  verge science team is doing just amazing work. So check out the virtual com

64
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,640
Speaker 1:  slash science. We've got all that. We've got other stuff, Nicole and I actually

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,510
Speaker 1:  had a long conversation the other day about what she's gonna cover as the

66
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,290
Speaker 1:  vaccine is, is what she's going to cover as the virus stops,

67
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,980
Speaker 1:  being the central story. And the answer is, oh man, tech companies have been

68
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,330
Speaker 1:  doing a lot of stuff. There's actually a lot of like health techs to cover.

69
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,780
Speaker 1:  So we're excited about that, but check out virtual Homme slash science, the

70
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,450
Speaker 1:  team doing incredible work is always okay.

71
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,700
Speaker 1:  Speaking of health windows, I'm open

72
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,630
Speaker 1:  Tom. I think my favorite story of the week was like, you're like

73
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,560
Speaker 1:  two sentence posts of Cortana on windows 11,

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,350
Speaker 1:  insisting that windows 11 doesn't exist. It's pretty good.

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,670
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that was short. I tweeted it, but Sean delivered the verge

76
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,420
Speaker 4:  goods. So windows 11 has leaked. Yeah, it has

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,350
Speaker 4:  leaked. It says windows 11, which is kind of the last time I was on, we

78
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,830
Speaker 4:  were basically saying it was going to be winners 11, right? Yeah, no surprise

79
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,070
Speaker 4:  there.

80
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,120
Speaker 2:  What do you think Microsoft's excuse is going to be for going to

81
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,930
Speaker 2:  windows 11 after they said for a couple years

82
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,710
Speaker 2:  now that windows 10 is the last version of windows and windows as a service.

83
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,620
Speaker 2:  Now we're never going to change the increment, the number again, I

84
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,050
Speaker 4:  Think the way that they framed it, when they first launched, it was like

85
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,770
Speaker 4:  windows as a service, like officially in all the marketing speak. But in

86
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,070
Speaker 4:  like one of their developer ramp Angeles kinda went off.

87
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,990
Speaker 4:  buildOn was like, this is our last version. And kind of everyone ran

88
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,710
Speaker 4:  with that. And I think that that's obviously created the

89
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,920
Speaker 4:  idea that they would never would be windows 11. And to be honest, Microsoft

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,130
Speaker 4:  never really came out and said that that was wrong. But I feel like they're

91
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,100
Speaker 4:  probably just gonna be like, that was something that someone said

92
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,560
Speaker 1:  Words

93
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,550
Speaker 2:  Don't have, meaning there's no consequence. We never

94
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,210
Speaker 4:  Really said, I didn't even know if they're going to fully

95
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,940
Speaker 4:  address it or whatever, because yeah. Like it

96
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,740
Speaker 4:  involves throwing someone under the bus essentially. But yeah, I think that's,

97
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,350
Speaker 4:  that's the kind of gist of it from the way I see it. Yeah.

98
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,980
Speaker 1:  It would be nice if they're honest and they're like PC sales have exploded,

99
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,030
Speaker 1:  which we weren't expecting. And so we just need to like juice the numbers.

100
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,570
Speaker 1:  Some like, I just wish some company would just be

101
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,170
Speaker 1:  honest.

102
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,900
Speaker 4:  I mean, like from what we've seen from the leak and everything, it's that

103
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,770
Speaker 4:  it's basically a windows 10 X. So they, they were happy to go with 10 X as

104
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,370
Speaker 4:  the branding, you know, a couple of years ago before the pandemic hit, like

105
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,250
Speaker 4:  it was October, then they announced a 10 X and then, you know, the

106
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,110
Speaker 4:  pandemic began

107
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,790
Speaker 1:  And there's the before time, there's the pandemic. And then there's like

108
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,670
Speaker 1:  last week and those are the only time periods I recognize. Yeah.

109
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,870
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Everything is March. Yeah. So yeah, like that, they obviously had an

110
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,960
Speaker 4:  idea to go 10 X at one point and they were happy with that branding, but

111
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,020
Speaker 4:  they will see for, you know, what, we're going to do some extra work

112
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,980
Speaker 4:  unless, you know, let's push the market. The marketing folks have been

113
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,070
Speaker 4:  like, Hmm, we could call this 11.

114
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,640
Speaker 4:  And then obviously all the teaser that's been happening over the past few

115
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,540
Speaker 4:  weeks and stuff. So, but yeah, it, it, it leaked and it looks like it's going

116
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,020
Speaker 4:  to be 11.

117
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,370
Speaker 1:  Okay. Let's just start with start. See what I did there. Oh, that's

118
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,210
Speaker 1:  good. I'm a professional podcaster. Why does the start menu come up

119
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,140
Speaker 1:  from the middle of the screen? This is the only thing that I've seen

120
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,890
Speaker 1:  in the, like I watched the little video you tweeted. I like

121
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,760
Speaker 1:  looked at some and I'm just focused on the fact that you

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,380
Speaker 1:  push the start button it's in the middle of the school.

123
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,550
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think because Macko S chromo S

124
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,360
Speaker 4:  I think like that, that general thing, I think more broadly is that like

125
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,350
Speaker 4:  people using windows are using ultra winds now, bigger,

126
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,370
Speaker 4:  wider monitors. And so having your like start menu on the left, doesn't actually

127
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,240
Speaker 4:  really make sense on those sorts of panels. What I'm curious about is

128
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,630
Speaker 4:  whether they move it for everyone, because there is an option to shift it

129
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,500
Speaker 4:  back to the left select. If you install it by default, it does actually move

130
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,220
Speaker 4:  everything to the middle. But this is, this is a leaked early

131
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,210
Speaker 4:  version. So who knows if, if you already have the menu on the left and are

132
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,580
Speaker 4:  they going to force you into the center? I don't know. I feel like they probably

133
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,910
Speaker 4:  will force you into the center, but there is an option to go back. But I

134
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,510
Speaker 4:  think, I think it's just, it's the evolution of

135
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,170
Speaker 4:  like chromo S has gotten that way. Obviously Macko list

136
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,430
Speaker 4:  has been that way for decades. It kind of makes

137
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,120
Speaker 4:  sense in, in a way. And I think it's more of a decluttering of

138
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,990
Speaker 4:  windows as well. Like just, I think they're trying to get away from

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,260
Speaker 4:  that the moment you can pin so much stuff to your task, but it can have all

140
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,110
Speaker 4:  your apps there because no one really wants to touch the start menu because

141
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,530
Speaker 4:  it's kind of, you know, all these live tiles and it's a bit, there's a lot

142
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,260
Speaker 4:  going on there. Whereas I think they're trying to bring that back. Like,

143
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,350
Speaker 4:  no, go to the start menu. You've got your recent documents. It's actually

144
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,070
Speaker 4:  useful, you know, like making it a bit more of a useful tool again.

145
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,870
Speaker 4:  So doing that, I think it's discouraged people from pinning stuff

146
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,570
Speaker 4:  on, onto the dock, essentially. Yeah.

147
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,290
Speaker 2:  It gravitates to it being in the center. I gravitate to, they have, they've

148
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,200
Speaker 2:  just given up on lifestyles. They've, they've taken that out of the start

149
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,230
Speaker 2:  menu. Now, Liz, like they're not lifestyles anymore or they're something

150
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,130
Speaker 2:  else and they live somewhere else. And so now it's file

151
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,820
Speaker 2:  recommended files and your apps, that whole

152
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,330
Speaker 2:  dream of mixing your personal information and glanceable

153
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,550
Speaker 2:  information and starting your apps and putting all that together. It started

154
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,770
Speaker 2:  windows phone is like, it's officially dead and gone.

155
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,400
Speaker 2:  Right? No, and that's fine. Like, no one really has liked it for the past

156
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,330
Speaker 2:  couple of years. Design trend trains, just design trends change or whatever.

157
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,410
Speaker 2:  But yeah, like the start menu is just, it's very, very

158
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,250
Speaker 2:  chromo se. Now it's sort of Mackey like the launch thing on Mac, but

159
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,760
Speaker 2:  nobody ever uses that. And that's kind of bad. I don't know how, how,

160
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,910
Speaker 2:  if I even think of this as a start menu anymore, if I gotta be honest with

161
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,880
Speaker 2:  you, like, I feel like the start menu was cool. Cause it had more it's the

162
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,400
Speaker 2:  launcher, right? Yeah. It's a launcher. Not a start menu. Yeah.

163
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,300
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think, yeah. And I think that's, that's, that's obviously intentional.

164
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,360
Speaker 4:  Like you say, like the live tiles, they were, they were super useful for

165
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,110
Speaker 4:  like glance information, but then people soon realized how much

166
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,230
Speaker 4:  clients will information do actually want. Right. It's like the weather and

167
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,190
Speaker 4:  the news two obvious points. But beyond that,

168
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,070
Speaker 4:  it's like, no I'm going into the app and like digging through, I don't really

169
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,880
Speaker 4:  need the glanceable information. And they've put that like, glanceable sort

170
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,870
Speaker 4:  of weather new stuff in the taskbar on windows 10 currently. And then in

171
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,650
Speaker 4:  windows 11, they're actually moving into a separate widgets panel. So,

172
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,090
Speaker 4:  so they've obviously, there's still some of that elements of the stuff that

173
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,810
Speaker 4:  they wanted to do with live tiles. It's just, they're bringing back what

174
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,060
Speaker 4:  they were doing with widgets in Vista instead.

175
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,210
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So like, but it's definitely, it's going away. It's a launch now.

176
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,320
Speaker 4:  I, yeah, I agree. I don't really see it as like a start menu so much

177
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,800
Speaker 4:  anymore. It's definitely a launches. It's a portal for like quickly getting

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,580
Speaker 4:  access to documents, getting out to search and you're in your

179
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,370
Speaker 4:  apps and you know, your frequent amps and stuff. So yeah.

180
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,540
Speaker 1:  It's like, it's so funny to me to think about the

181
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,290
Speaker 1:  journey Microsoft has been on with this one button in windows

182
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,130
Speaker 1:  and then moving it again and making sure moving it around. Like it was the

183
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,120
Speaker 1:  revolution for windows 95. Like this was the thing they

184
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,930
Speaker 1:  licensed the rolling stones song because of the start button,

185
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,220
Speaker 1:  because literally people had no idea what to do when they sat down at a windows

186
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,030
Speaker 1:  PC and they're like, here's a button it's going to have stuff in it. And

187
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,780
Speaker 1:  it has so far expanded. Then they got rid of it in

188
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,620
Speaker 1:  eight. Then they realized that was the worst idea

189
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,280
Speaker 1:  that they've ever had. They brought it back in this other

190
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,210
Speaker 1:  conception. And it's just, it's kind of just going back to where it

191
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,570
Speaker 1:  started in like a pretty real way. Right?

192
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
Speaker 1:  Like here's a bunch of stuff that you might want to immediately do.

193
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,090
Speaker 4:  Obviously removed it in a, put it back in 8.1. But like they still had the

194
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,930
Speaker 4:  live tiles interface and then obviously windows 10 came and

195
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,620
Speaker 4:  just took things way back. But like kind of still kept those lifestyles.

196
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,740
Speaker 4:  It was like a really weird, like they didn't fully step back, but now they're

197
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,980
Speaker 4:  like, Hey, we're not even fully stepping back. We're just going to kind of

198
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,760
Speaker 4:  get rid of the start menu sort of interface that we've been, we've had a

199
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,300
Speaker 4:  flake years now and then just put it back to something really simple. And

200
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,140
Speaker 4:  I think that that simple or like concept is, is

201
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,770
Speaker 4:  broadly what this is, you know, like they're trying to simplify as windows

202
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,810
Speaker 4:  a little bit more, which is what 10 X was supposed to be. It's supposed to

203
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,620
Speaker 4:  be like cleaning up windows. Right. Simplifying it and make

204
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,770
Speaker 4:  it run on different hardware. But I think they they've obviously seen that,

205
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,520
Speaker 4:  that what, why, why should we do a separate sort of product

206
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,060
Speaker 4:  because they've done that before and it's never worked, has it. So it's like,

207
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,930
Speaker 4:  let's just do this two windows, but don't go too hard. Like

208
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,920
Speaker 4:  where you, you know, moving everything around, but doing it

209
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,330
Speaker 4:  in a way that it makes sense.

210
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,250
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean, God forbid that they clean up the toolbar in the,

211
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,520
Speaker 2:  you know, the, the file Explorer. What is the story?

212
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,890
Speaker 2:  And there's so much crap there.

213
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,460
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. The rib, the ribbon is still there. File Explorer still. It's

214
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,450
Speaker 4:  the same. I don't know whether that's fully going to change because so a

215
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,360
Speaker 4:  lot of the stuff that we do see, like if you look in the system tray, it

216
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,350
Speaker 4:  kind of looks a bit weird with the date, like triple stack and stuff

217
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,680
Speaker 4:  like that. Like that will all change. Like that's, that's definitely not

218
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,670
Speaker 4:  what it should look like. It's just this an early build, but stuff

219
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,370
Speaker 4:  like the file Explorer and everything, that's going to change radically.

220
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,780
Speaker 1:  Let's try some out followers for us. We have this conversation about the

221
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,740
Speaker 1:  iPad all the time, right? Like the iPad is like fully abstracted, the

222
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,610
Speaker 1:  file system away from you. There's this endless debate that they've

223
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,840
Speaker 1:  kind of re-engaged with iOS 15, like, is this a spatial

224
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,200
Speaker 1:  interface or is it chronological one? Like,

225
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,760
Speaker 1:  do you understand the core metaphor of this computer? And

226
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,630
Speaker 1:  like with the iPad we talk about every time, like the answer is no, like

227
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,710
Speaker 1:  apple needs to do a better job file Explorer to me is the most stubborn.

228
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,860
Speaker 1:  No. From any computer company ever,

229
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,450
Speaker 1:  right. It's like it's full of the computer trying to help you in

230
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,360
Speaker 1:  ways that are absolutely not helpful by

231
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,020
Speaker 1:  exposing all of the controls to you and

232
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,620
Speaker 1:  minimizing just the folder structure of the PC.

233
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,240
Speaker 1:  Like, what I really want is like, here's the root level of the hard drive.

234
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,540
Speaker 1:  And here are some quick links to where I might want to go. And instead it's

235
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,230
Speaker 1:  like, here's some recent things. Here's every command you might ever want

236
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,130
Speaker 1:  to do with a file. Here's a dynamically generated list

237
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,460
Speaker 1:  of like things we think you use frequently. Right. And then like

238
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,720
Speaker 1:  what human has ever looked at this and been like, I understand how to

239
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,310
Speaker 1:  use this computer. And every time I opened this window, my muscle memory

240
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,920
Speaker 1:  will like kick in and I'll do it well. And Microsoft has like looked at that

241
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,200
Speaker 1:  for 10 years and been like, that's

242
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,130
Speaker 2:  Cool. If you, the easy access button is in file Explorer and what it

243
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,880
Speaker 2:  does and what its function is, please tweet at Tom Warren and let him know.

244
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,320
Speaker 2:  Cause I, I do not.

245
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,280
Speaker 4:  The, the problem is once they start changing things, that's when people are

246
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,940
Speaker 4:  like, no, don't do that. Like, because there is, like you say that there's

247
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,810
Speaker 4:  a muscle memory, you build up, we've using this. And whether it's this, the

248
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,050
Speaker 4:  interface that it should be or not is a different question. But it's the

249
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,110
Speaker 4:  interface that people get used to using. That's that's the problem.

250
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,890
Speaker 1:  I think this is the thing that is always paralyzed Microsoft. Right? They

251
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,430
Speaker 1:  are so aware of the edge cases of all of their

252
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,410
Speaker 1:  software. And they're like, what if we lose one word

253
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,190
Speaker 1:  customer? Yeah. We can never change it. And I

254
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,910
Speaker 1:  just like Microsoft is like, their software design is almost defined

255
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,310
Speaker 1:  by how afraid they are irritating. Some people.

256
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,130
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, they've described it like in the past as like crane

257
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,030
Speaker 4:  pizza for a billion people, right. With different toppings like that, that's

258
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,840
Speaker 4:  kind of it like, there's so many different ways to do stuff in windows that

259
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,320
Speaker 4:  then if you change one of those ways to a certain path,

260
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,240
Speaker 4:  like people, people get upset.

261
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,810
Speaker 1:  So funny. Cause like, what are they going to do? Like we live in the age

262
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,260
Speaker 1:  of tech monopolies, like where are those customers going to go?

263
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,130
Speaker 1:  Like, that's how all of the other companies handle this problem. They're

264
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,370
Speaker 1:  like, yeah, that sucks. No meaningful choices.

265
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,700
Speaker 4:  It's true. Like there is, there is no competition to windows

266
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,630
Speaker 4:  really. Like, I mean, Android is probably the closest thing that

267
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,500
Speaker 4:  looked remotely like a fret, but obviously Macko is, is you have to buy the

268
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,860
Speaker 4:  hardware. So yeah, that's, that's not the same sort of competition,

269
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,360
Speaker 4:  but yeah, like from what we've seen in leak, I don't

270
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,020
Speaker 4:  feel like they've gone far enough,

271
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,740
Speaker 4:  but then I don't want to say that because I don't know how far they're going

272
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,130
Speaker 4:  to go next week and show early build and that sort of stuff. But

273
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,660
Speaker 4:  I think still, I don't feel like it's going to go far enough to be, you know,

274
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,680
Speaker 4:  I think to warrant the 11. Mm. Yeah.

275
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,550
Speaker 2:  I mean, that's my big question and like my easy dunk and it's like,

276
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,540
Speaker 2:  it's a hahaha, you know, thing, but it's also, I think really telling is

277
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,470
Speaker 2:  you, you tweeted out that you can still go in there and find like some

278
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,650
Speaker 2:  windows 95 shit. Like the control panel is still lurking

279
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,560
Speaker 2:  underneath all this pretty exterior. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

280
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,640
Speaker 4:  And it's like, it's definitely beyond the point where they should get rid

281
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,790
Speaker 4:  of the control panel now. Yeah. You can surface those settings within the

282
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,480
Speaker 4:  main things that, but that is literally just there for legacy and

283
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,380
Speaker 4:  enterprise. So it's like the same reason that internet is still exists

284
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,980
Speaker 4:  and windows 10 right now, even though we've had two versions of edge. Yeah.

285
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,760
Speaker 4:  Like that is, that's literally why control panel access. So it's just

286
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,450
Speaker 4:  because there's a bunch of CIS admins that use a particular tool or

287
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,510
Speaker 4:  control panel applet that plugs into it. And it's like,

288
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,540
Speaker 4:  unfortunately that's a lot of their customers. Yeah.

289
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,840
Speaker 1:  It's just, I'm just like, what do they, in the beginning saw Linux come on

290
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,810
Speaker 1:  like some off, like, are you

291
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,480
Speaker 4:  It's like the age old debate? Isn't it. It's like, they're great at like

292
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,470
Speaker 4:  supporting legacy stuff across windows, exports, back compatibility and all

293
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,400
Speaker 4:  that sort of stuff. Like that's one of Microsoft's great is things

294
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,060
Speaker 4:  that you can still run like apps from windows free, free

295
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,780
Speaker 4:  11 on here, you know, like that's, that's kind of insane that, that you can

296
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,380
Speaker 4:  do that, but it's also like just their worst enemy.

297
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,100
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

298
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,580
Speaker 1:  I mean, it's, it's, it is very much the character of Mike. There's no way

299
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,090
Speaker 1:  that, that care that DNA of Microsoft will not change. Right. Like

300
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,890
Speaker 1:  this is what they need windows to be it, everything

301
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,310
Speaker 1:  everywhere. They have a security model now that

302
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,510
Speaker 1:  kind of demands that you keep updating windows in this way. So they have

303
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,350
Speaker 1:  to keep the legacy stuff going, because I mean, like we

304
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,950
Speaker 1:  also live in the age of ransomware attacks, right? Like there's lots of reasons

305
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,790
Speaker 1:  to keep going the way they're going. I just think it's a very funny

306
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,510
Speaker 1:  that in the age of tech monopolies, Microsoft is like, what if we lose one

307
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,970
Speaker 1:  customer? And it's like, I don't, there's nowhere to go.

308
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,930
Speaker 1:  Like, if you want to play games in your PC, what are you going to do? If

309
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,540
Speaker 1:  you're mad at a setting as well? Yeah.

310
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,080
Speaker 4:  Like they dominate that they dominate it, but they don't like they dominate

311
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,080
Speaker 4:  gaming, but they don't really control it. This is totally out of their hands.

312
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,110
Speaker 4:  You know? Like it's steam is steam that really controls it, which is, it

313
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,480
Speaker 4:  was just kind of crazy to think about it as well. What else are you

314
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,610
Speaker 1:  Seeing in 11 and what are you hoping to see?

315
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,390
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So like obviously the start menus is the main thing. There's a bunch

316
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,600
Speaker 4:  of like out of box experience stuff. So like when you're setting up a new

317
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,260
Speaker 4:  laptop, that's like a lot nicer called Tana is no longer screaming at you

318
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:45,780
Speaker 4:  that you

319
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,100
Speaker 1:  High up your PSA or anything like that.

320
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,890
Speaker 4:  It it's the niceties of wrap around that. Some stuff's missing

321
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,820
Speaker 4:  that we weren't expecting. It's like the store, obviously the store has

322
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,210
Speaker 4:  been a bit of a pain point really, since it's existed, to be honest

323
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,590
Speaker 4:  and there's rumors that that's going to be totally overhauled. We don't see

324
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,400
Speaker 4:  any evidence of that in this leaked version, but I'm still definitely expecting

325
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,280
Speaker 4:  that to be revealed next week. And with it, like whatever changes

326
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,050
Speaker 4:  they do to let more apps into the store. So I think that will be a pretty

327
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,740
Speaker 4:  significant change to windows to be. So, cause even though you can get these

328
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,490
Speaker 4:  like, you know, rival browsers like Chrome, you can go to the web and download

329
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,300
Speaker 4:  them, having them in the store just makes it a lot easier to

330
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,530
Speaker 4:  set up your PC and restore and stuff. So

331
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,110
Speaker 1:  Windows event, June 24th, we'll obviously see more.

332
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,250
Speaker 1:  Yep. Lots of com other Microsoft news this

333
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,940
Speaker 1:  week, they announced that Sasha Andela is now the company's

334
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,660
Speaker 1:  chairman as well as the CEO, which is, it feels like a big deal.

335
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,390
Speaker 1:  He's now fully in charge of Microsoft in the way that gates was, which is

336
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,790
Speaker 1:  kind of interesting. Like they never get this done bomber, right?

337
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,240
Speaker 4:  No, they went like fully independent with

338
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,980
Speaker 4:  what was his name? John treneman bit surname. But anyway, they had an

339
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,760
Speaker 4:  independent chairman, John Thompson, John Thompson that's right now they

340
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,510
Speaker 4:  obviously have confidence in the delegator to be sort of fully in charge

341
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,440
Speaker 4:  of thing, which it does show you how much influence he's had on

342
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,920
Speaker 4:  the company since he became CEO. And so it's just how,

343
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,210
Speaker 4:  how much Microsoft changed really? Like I've, I've seen it in, in both their

344
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,110
Speaker 4:  products and people really, I think before their accessibility work was

345
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,800
Speaker 4:  impressive, but it was one of those sort of backstories. Like they didn't

346
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,310
Speaker 4:  really make it shine, but now they have like, you know, exports, adaptive

347
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,300
Speaker 4:  controller. They have like all these crazy accessibility options in windows.

348
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,150
Speaker 4:  Like they've really pulled that to the front because of Nadella. And that's

349
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,780
Speaker 4:  just a small example, but like there's obviously a bigger trust within there

350
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,640
Speaker 4:  to put him in the, in the chairman role.

351
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,350
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And it's funny that when he first got that job, he did a log interview

352
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,740
Speaker 1:  with him where I asked him, why does Microsoft exist? And he had some like

353
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,400
Speaker 1:  answers, but now he's like, he figured it out. Yeah. So that's

354
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,210
Speaker 1:  exciting. Anyway, a windows event, June 24th, but

355
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,140
Speaker 1:  this week was also, <inaudible> lots of news on

356
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,620
Speaker 1:  <inaudible> no switch pro, which is like what we were all expecting, which

357
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,430
Speaker 1:  didn't happen. But I think some of the biggest news <inaudible> is around

358
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,450
Speaker 1:  Xbox. They announced that they're going to make their own streaming

359
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,260
Speaker 1:  stick. They're going to start doing an X-Box app on other

360
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,160
Speaker 1:  smart TV platforms. Is it still called X cloud? X cloud

361
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,400
Speaker 1:  is like, it's in my head they're game streaming services called X cloud.

362
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
Speaker 1:  It's not called that, but they're going to do apps on smart TVs

363
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,170
Speaker 1:  that should work with their controllers to let you stream Xbox

364
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,990
Speaker 1:  games to TVs without any hardware. And then they're going to do their own

365
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,310
Speaker 1:  streaming stick clearly, which will have the Xbox interface and be

366
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,520
Speaker 1:  designed around that. But let you do all the media stuff too. If I had to

367
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,210
Speaker 1:  say there's a lot of obviously exciting games, news

368
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,260
Speaker 1:  83, I tried. But if I had to pick the one

369
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,160
Speaker 1:  gigantic thing that will reshape the industry, it's Metroid

370
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,360
Speaker 1:  shaped the industry.

371
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,800
Speaker 1:  It already has, what can it do? The Xbox series X mini fridge. It's not going

372
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,520
Speaker 1:  to reshape the industry. It was very cool. But I just think like Microsoft

373
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,130
Speaker 1:  decoupling as hardware and software is kind of a huge deal.

374
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And it's kind of been like this, this stuff has obviously been super

375
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,150
Speaker 4:  obvious, like Phil Spencer's sort of hinted that they were going to do streaming

376
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,780
Speaker 4:  devices and on the, on the TV and all that sort of stuff. But like for them

377
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,470
Speaker 4:  to say it, and it's built upon what they've been doing the last sort of two,

378
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,340
Speaker 4:  three years, really, which is like this focus of like, we don't

379
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,580
Speaker 4:  care about sending consoles anymore or at least that's, you know, that's

380
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,580
Speaker 4:  how vision and it's said as they sold

381
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,290
Speaker 4:  and it's like, yeah, like they've had some serious competition against Sony

382
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,190
Speaker 4:  and it's amazing what competition does, right. Makes you do like

383
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,360
Speaker 4:  innovative things and different things to your competition. So they've

384
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,110
Speaker 4:  definitely gone a different, completely different route to Sony. Sony is

385
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,260
Speaker 4:  like, we're going to say 60, $70 games. Microsoft's like, we're going to

386
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,620
Speaker 4:  sell your subscription and you're going to get it everywhere. And I think

387
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,860
Speaker 4:  we spoke about this last time I was on, it was just like a lot of people

388
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,950
Speaker 4:  compare it to like the Netflix of gaming and all that sort of stuff.

389
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,240
Speaker 4:  And to get there, you do need to be everywhere. You do need to be on

390
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,050
Speaker 4:  TVs. You need to have your own streaming devices. You need to, you know,

391
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,860
Speaker 4:  you need to cut these deals to make sure you're everywhere. And they obviously

392
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,730
Speaker 4:  had problems trying to get to the iPhone that way, but they will

393
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,640
Speaker 4:  see not going to have too many problems with TV manufacturers. They already

394
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,170
Speaker 4:  have a crazy relationship with Samsung. So I can imagine Samsung is gonna

395
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,140
Speaker 4:  have some, maybe not exclusivity, but they'll definitely be there day one.

396
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,740
Speaker 1:  I'm sure. You know, it's just turning about the, the point with the iPhone

397
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,010
Speaker 1:  is they had to figure out how to make this work in the iPhone swept browser.

398
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,580
Speaker 1:  And almost all of the TV platforms

399
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,650
Speaker 1:  are based on HTML five. So I think that worked probably like paid

400
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,430
Speaker 1:  dividends across the board because if you look at writing native apps for

401
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,670
Speaker 1:  the TV platforms, almost nobody does it a because all they're really doing

402
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,240
Speaker 1:  is delivering video streams. Then B you have to write a Tizen app and an

403
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,570
Speaker 1:  Android app and a web ALS and like nobody wants to do that. So they've all

404
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,870
Speaker 1:  settled on HTML five apps as a way to cut across the board.

405
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,460
Speaker 1:  And I'm very curious if the work they had to do to figure this out on

406
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,730
Speaker 1:  the iPhone and bypass the app store has paid dividends for them in the TV

407
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,330
Speaker 1:  market.

408
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,880
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm sure it has because they didn't actually do all the work themselves.

409
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,840
Speaker 4:  Like they've, they've actually outsourced a lot of it to, I can't remember

410
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,710
Speaker 4:  the exact name of the company, but they use it, someone else's stack to sort

411
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,860
Speaker 4:  of bring, bring it on board. So it makes it allows them to sort of focus

412
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,760
Speaker 4:  on the actual service side rather than the sort of platform of getting

413
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,600
Speaker 4:  it there. But yeah, like I can imagine this work was ongoing before

414
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,690
Speaker 4:  apple said, you know, we're not going to let you on the iPhone so that they

415
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,680
Speaker 4:  were ready for that scenario. He obviously just came a little bit later

416
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,280
Speaker 4:  than when it launched an Android, but it's definitely, yeah, that's definitely

417
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,150
Speaker 4:  a big part of it was to go to TVs. They've, they've spoken about going to

418
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,690
Speaker 4:  Facebook gaming because they obviously sold off mixer

419
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,710
Speaker 4:  to Facebook, but we haven't heard much more about that, but that was another

420
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,950
Speaker 4:  sort of area where they're supposed to be lighting up it's cloud. They've

421
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,820
Speaker 4:  obviously gone to the web, but the idea was that, you know, you'd

422
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,300
Speaker 4:  have it in these streams and you bid click a button kind of similar to stadia,

423
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,960
Speaker 4:  right? Like where the idea was you'd be on YouTube, see a person

424
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,860
Speaker 4:  streaming it, click play, and be playing with them or be playing at the point

425
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,800
Speaker 4:  they were playing it. And I think they were supposed to be doing some stuff

426
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,590
Speaker 4:  at Facebook there, but we haven't heard much more about that. But that's

427
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,460
Speaker 4:  all part of like this broader sort of X cloud, it's not called X cloud. It's

428
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,980
Speaker 4:  called, what is it called? I don't

429
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,100
Speaker 1:  Even

430
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,690
Speaker 1:  series X-Box live project. Just pick

431
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,610
Speaker 1:  some of those words. And you got exposed

432
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,570
Speaker 4:  Gaming. I think it's officially called <inaudible>. It is way

433
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:41,470
Speaker 4:  cooler. It's so much cooler. This, the shape thing is the underlying

434
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,380
Speaker 4:  technology is called project X cloud. And they still keep saying that.

435
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,180
Speaker 1:  Okay. So I'm just going to call it AXA.

436
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,430
Speaker 1:  Okay. So

437
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,180
Speaker 2:  Like in, in three years is the idea that you will

438
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,020
Speaker 2:  only buy an Xbox console if you have crappy bandwidth.

439
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,290
Speaker 2:  Is that like the vision here? Like you'll buy it if you want the very, very,

440
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,160
Speaker 2:  very best graphics and you care a lot about that. Or if you have really

441
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,850
Speaker 2:  shitty bandwidth, otherwise, why would you bother? You should just stream

442
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,540
Speaker 2:  all your games.

443
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,500
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like I don't, I don't think that's the vision for three years now.

444
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,970
Speaker 4:  I think it's like, it's an add on right? It's it's like, if

445
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,960
Speaker 4:  you don't own an X-Box and you don't want to own one, then go for it.

446
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,590
Speaker 4:  If you want to play on mobile, then yeah. Go, you know, get the subscription.

447
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,550
Speaker 4:  It, it really it's it's to really push game pals, isn't it like

448
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,880
Speaker 4:  it's any sort of entry point then for the next

449
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,270
Speaker 1:  Three months here, you want an X-Box. He can't get one.

450
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,280
Speaker 1:  Well, I mean, like we are hearing the truth, the shortage is going to last

451
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,000
Speaker 1:  another 12, 18 months. Like there's also just

452
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,040
Speaker 1:  very compelling solution to the Xbox series X

453
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,850
Speaker 1:  problem. Yeah. Right. Which is like, you can just stream your

454
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,090
Speaker 1:  games. Like he ain't got a PS five or an X-Box like just sign up for game,

455
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,900
Speaker 1:  pass and stream a bunch of next gen games. Maybe they'll look a little

456
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,300
Speaker 1:  bit worse, but you're still getting next gen games.

457
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,380
Speaker 2:  That sounds like a really good idea for like a game streaming service that

458
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,700
Speaker 2:  like Google could put together. Maybe

459
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,740
Speaker 2:  they should think about trying to make a game streaming service with that

460
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,090
Speaker 2:  sort of a goo well

461
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,600
Speaker 1:  Announced an at and T partnership with stadia. And I was like, what are you

462
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,590
Speaker 1:  doing? This is a kiss of death. It's like a, like

463
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,510
Speaker 1:  a Dementor from Harry Potter. It's sucks. Her life force

464
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,150
Speaker 1:  out of yo

465
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,910
Speaker 2:  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. The world has shifted. It used

466
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,060
Speaker 2:  to be that if you had an exclusive sprit partnership, you were doomed now

467
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,900
Speaker 2:  it's at and T

468
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,250
Speaker 1:  It's amazing. He breathes on you. Like petrified, never

469
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,180
Speaker 1:  compete again. Horrible. All right. Any

470
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,740
Speaker 1:  other <inaudible> news? You want to talk about Dieter?

471
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I said, I tried a few times, you know, I'm excited for some of the

472
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,600
Speaker 2:  other games, Nintendo Scott. I wasn't really expecting a switch pro, but

473
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,500
Speaker 2:  whatever I thought that I don't technically was this S3, like

474
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,310
Speaker 2:  the, the Starfield stuff, the halo, infinite stuff. Like

475
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,070
Speaker 2:  all that seems pretty good. Like Starfield looks

476
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,180
Speaker 4:  Really good. Yeah. Like I think that the thing that Starfield

477
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,170
Speaker 4:  was like kind of a teaser of what's to come, that's not till like late

478
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,890
Speaker 4:  next year, but it looks like an interesting concept. But the thing that really

479
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,790
Speaker 4:  stood out for me, it was false. The tech demo of that was, was pretty.

480
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,570
Speaker 4:  It was pretty interesting. I think overall, like just the exports eat

481
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,200
Speaker 4:  free. Like they did a really good job, which I was kind of

482
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,440
Speaker 4:  surprised at because I think they've for the past sort of, I dunno, since

483
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,070
Speaker 4:  the X-Box 360, really, they've been kind of flailing free and

484
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,210
Speaker 4:  behind these exclusive titles that Sony has just been

485
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,200
Speaker 4:  constantly delivering. And I think they finally answered and be like,

486
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,890
Speaker 4:  okay, it's custom, whatever it was 8 billion or whatever it was for preferred

487
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,950
Speaker 4:  stock. So it's customer a bunch of money.

488
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,850
Speaker 1:  I will say that I haven't wanted to buy a series X, like right.

489
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,420
Speaker 1:  It's hard. So I haven't been trying very hard, but I haven't even been trying

490
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,380
Speaker 1:  because that has what I need. But between flight

491
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,070
Speaker 1:  simulator coming next month and that fours it down, I'm like, all right.

492
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,090
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They got some interesting stuff coming. So I think it's, it's, it's

493
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,960
Speaker 4:  kind of coming like just constantly every month for the

494
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,040
Speaker 4:  next six months. So

495
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,910
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. If something is cross-platform, I default to buying it on Xbox

496
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,300
Speaker 2:  basically after this week, because like, it there'll be a better chance that'll

497
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,960
Speaker 2:  be on their streaming service. It'll just be a little bit more portable.

498
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,830
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's weird. Like I, I, my PS five is going to become a PS five exclusive

499
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,440
Speaker 2:  machine and everything else I think is going to be on X-Box.

500
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,320
Speaker 1:  I think Sony is very happy about that scenario. Yeah. I don't think they

501
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,010
Speaker 1:  care if they are totally fine with that, but you're going to become the person

502
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,880
Speaker 1:  playing games on an Android phone. When you get you little Android game controller,

503
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
Speaker 1:  it'd be streaming. I've already got a Kishi. It's great. I love it. All right.

552
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,690
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's going to have you a lot of anti-trust news this week, including

553
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,590
Speaker 1:  like a secret switcher Ru from the Biden administration with Lina

554
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,220
Speaker 1:  Khan, which is very exciting for five minutes, a bunch of bills from the

555
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,080
Speaker 1:  house. Let's start with Lina Khan, who

556
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,070
Speaker 1:  was just appointed confirmed to the federal trade commission.

557
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,880
Speaker 1:  That's a big deal.

558
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,370
Speaker 5:  It's a really big deal. So this week she finally received a floor

559
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,910
Speaker 5:  vote. It was a bipartisan vote, Republicans and Democrats, not going to say

560
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,720
Speaker 5:  all Republicans, but enough to get her confirmed voted for her. And

561
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,560
Speaker 5:  that was early in the morning, about 1130 ish. And then

562
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,820
Speaker 5:  a couple hours later, I was watching this

563
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,570
Speaker 5:  hearing on smart home check and competition and Amy

564
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,760
Speaker 5:  Klobuchar, friend of the pod

565
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,000
Speaker 5:  she leaked. And she basically scooped everyone that Lena was going to

566
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,790
Speaker 5:  be the chairwoman of the FTC and lead the agency.

567
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,820
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And then there was like a mad scramble to be like, what'd she say?

568
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,090
Speaker 5:  Right. And it was like, she misspeak speak. And then all of a sudden Reuters

569
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,540
Speaker 5:  is reporting. This is confirmed. And everyone was like, oh, dang. Okay,

570
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,440
Speaker 5:  cool. So she took her oath of office on Tuesday, I

571
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,570
Speaker 5:  believe. And she is currently leading the FTC.

572
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,920
Speaker 1:  That's amazing. So Lena is somebody also a friend of the bod she

573
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,700
Speaker 1:  has been on the verge has before probably listeners know this, but quickly.

574
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,510
Speaker 1:  She was a law student at Columbia. She wrote a really influential

575
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,170
Speaker 1:  lottery paper about Amazon called Amazon's antitrust paradox,

576
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,860
Speaker 1:  remarkable for a law students law review article to be that influential.

577
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,580
Speaker 1:  She ended up advising agencies advising the

578
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,880
Speaker 1:  FTC. Then she was on David Sicily's

579
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,140
Speaker 1:  antitrust subcommittee wrote a lot of the investigation then

580
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,590
Speaker 1:  was nominated for that. And now she's the chair of the MTC. Like she's in

581
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,160
Speaker 1:  charge of overseeing mergers and acquisitions of

582
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,420
Speaker 1:  making sure the markets are competitive, just a real rocket ship of her

583
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:23,380
Speaker 1:  career from law school to leading the MTC. And she has not

584
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,350
Speaker 1:  been shy about how she perceives the power of these become

585
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,910
Speaker 5:  Right. It's really remarkable too. So when she was first nominated, everyone

586
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,730
Speaker 5:  had assumed that she was just going to be another democratic vote on the

587
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,510
Speaker 5:  commission. And it's still really, you know, great for, you

588
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,230
Speaker 5:  know, people who are critics of big tech to have someone on that on the

589
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,100
Speaker 5:  commission, like point, you know, just as on its own. But it, the,

590
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,150
Speaker 5:  the power that now she has to basically lead these

591
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,540
Speaker 5:  investigations on these companies. And

592
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,260
Speaker 5:  basically she has the power to instruct staff to do specific

593
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,620
Speaker 5:  rulemakings. She can do these extensive six B

594
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,520
Speaker 5:  studies that the FTC can't necessarily subpoena companies, but they

595
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,300
Speaker 5:  are able to compel these companies to reveal certain documents and

596
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,900
Speaker 5:  things. So it really is the Biden administration saying by

597
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,830
Speaker 5:  appointing her chair, that they are going to take antitrust and

598
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,380
Speaker 5:  tech extremely seriously over the next four years.

599
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,320
Speaker 1:  Why do you think they weren't clear that she was going to be the chair?

600
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,640
Speaker 5:  Because I don't think everyone would have voted for

601
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,170
Speaker 5:  her if that was the case

602
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,840
Speaker 5:  during her confirmation hearing in the Senate, if she got a lot

603
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,620
Speaker 5:  of bipartisan applause from Republicans and Democrats, right? They were both

604
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,600
Speaker 5:  very excited for her. And it, it makes sense because over

605
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,320
Speaker 5:  the past couple of years, Republicans have their gripes with big tech

606
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,940
Speaker 5:  Democrats have theirs and Lena, both of them, both of the

607
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,870
Speaker 5:  parties are really leading towards competition as a way of remediating those

608
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,620
Speaker 5:  concerns. And so having someone so progressive and having

609
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,740
Speaker 5:  someone so aggressive on this front was good for both of them.

610
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,240
Speaker 5:  Now, of course, the aggressive nature of this may

611
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,050
Speaker 5:  be more than put both parties might have won it. So it was really

612
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,010
Speaker 5:  interesting to see such a overwhelming bipartisan vote on Tuesday.

613
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,180
Speaker 5:  And I think I'm thinking specifically like the chairwoman of the

614
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,110
Speaker 5:  FTC before Lina Khan was Rebecca slaughter and slaughter used to work

615
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,920
Speaker 5:  in Schumer's office. So maybe Schumer may not have even voted for con

616
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,050
Speaker 5:  and then maybe some Republicans wouldn't have either.

617
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,480
Speaker 1:  Wow. So she's in place, the vitamin assertion, hasn't filled a

618
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,200
Speaker 1:  bunch of these roles, but she's in place. That's a big piece of the

619
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,010
Speaker 1:  puzzle. And that is connected to the five bills that were introduced in the

620
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,850
Speaker 1:  house. One of which would really give more resources to the FTC,

621
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,670
Speaker 1:  but let's go through the five, what were the five? Right?

622
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,940
Speaker 5:  So they basically address

623
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,410
Speaker 5:  everything that was uncovered in these 16 months

624
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,400
Speaker 5:  long investigation that the house judiciary committee had last year and the

625
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,150
Speaker 5:  year before it. And they vary from something that

626
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,870
Speaker 5:  is, you know, very bipartisan, something that I could see more

627
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,410
Speaker 5:  center left center, right. Folks voting for. And then also

628
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,560
Speaker 5:  something, some things that are a little bit more controversial, right.

629
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,210
Speaker 5:  But when they were introduced earlier last Friday, they

630
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,840
Speaker 5:  all had bipartisan co-sponsors, which was

631
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,530
Speaker 5:  really interesting, a Republican and a Democrat introduced

632
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,220
Speaker 5:  each of these bills. So we can start going through what a lot of them do.

633
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,880
Speaker 5:  I'm looking at it. Now you'd mentioned the one that would give it's called

634
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,720
Speaker 5:  a merger filing seatbelt, and basically a large tech company, for

635
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,650
Speaker 5:  example, or any large company would have to pay more filing fee in

636
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:40,610
Speaker 5:  order for the FTC to really investigate whether or not the acquisition or

637
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,330
Speaker 5:  merger as you had to competitive that has already been passed in the

638
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,260
Speaker 5:  Senate by part of certainly under Amy Klobuchar and Chuck

639
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,130
Speaker 5:  Grassley. And so that seems like a bill that could really

640
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,940
Speaker 5:  get bipartisan support and really make it into law over the next

641
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,810
Speaker 5:  four years. But then we get into other things, another less controversial.

642
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,590
Speaker 5:  One is one on interoperability, right? And the ability for

643
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,880
Speaker 5:  me and you to go to Facebook, ask for our data.

644
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,960
Speaker 5:  And if we don't like Facebook, we can take it and go to Google plus, right.

645
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Speaker 5:  Something like that. I don't know the type of person who would do that,

646
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,850
Speaker 5:  but it makes, you know, it gets the opportunities there for folks to do

647
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,020
Speaker 5:  that. This is,

648
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,590
Speaker 2:  This is like data portability. It's not, they're going to force iMessage

649
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,290
Speaker 2:  and WhatsApp to talk to each other. Right.

650
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,370
Speaker 5:  So that I'm not entirely sure it's still a

651
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,730
Speaker 5:  little people are still trying to read the language and figure out

652
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,680
Speaker 5:  exactly what all of these do, but

653
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,280
Speaker 5:  let me get into the others. There's another

654
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,210
Speaker 5:  bill that would basically empower the justice department

655
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,720
Speaker 5:  and the federal trade commission to break up big tech companies and force

656
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,380
Speaker 5:  them to sell off parts of their business that create conflicts of

657
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,310
Speaker 5:  interest. So I'm thinking of Amazon carving off it's

658
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,240
Speaker 5:  house brands like Amazon basics or something like that. But th

659
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,080
Speaker 5:  th the bills go through just basically everything for

660
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,550
Speaker 5:  all of these individual companies.

661
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,440
Speaker 1:  That one to me, I think of these five bills as being kind of like a

662
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,280
Speaker 1:  negotiating tactic, right? If you had one big bill with all the

663
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,240
Speaker 1:  stuff in it, then people would latch on to the worst

664
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,190
Speaker 1:  parts they didn't like, and maybe you wouldn't get the easy stuff. So you

665
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,060
Speaker 1:  break them into five, you pass the filing fees, you

666
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,790
Speaker 1:  pass this data, portability interrupting that the company is already kind

667
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,090
Speaker 1:  of working on, right. Like not very controversial,

668
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,530
Speaker 1:  kind of, kind of SOPs, you know, like, okay, we're increasing the filing

669
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,050
Speaker 1:  fees. These are the five richest companies in the world. They're going to

670
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,010
Speaker 1:  be fine. Then you like move up the spectrum and you

671
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,090
Speaker 1:  get to the one that's like, you can't have a conflict of interest,

672
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,320
Speaker 1:  which just as I've read it. And I have read that

673
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,590
Speaker 1:  the unfortunate Twitter discourse around

674
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,690
Speaker 2:  It, and the

675
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,570
Speaker 1:  Immediate response from the tech companies and their lobbyists are like,

676
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,140
Speaker 1:  wait, people like this stuff like this bill might just die on the

677
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,800
Speaker 1:  vine, right? Like there's enough of an attack against it already where it's

678
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,470
Speaker 1:  like, people actually perceive AmazonBasics to be good.

679
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,240
Speaker 1:  The tech companies, a lobbying organization, the chamber for progress

680
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,930
Speaker 1:  made this incredible Twitter thread. And like, this would prevent Microsoft

681
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,440
Speaker 1:  from putting LinkedIn in word. And I was like, wait, hold up. Like, that's

682
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,220
Speaker 1:  good Redfin lock immediately. But there's this like long,

683
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,480
Speaker 1:  there's just like a long list of things that you might have to

684
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,050
Speaker 1:  sell or otherwise get rid of. Right? Like default apps on the iPhone.

685
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,500
Speaker 1:  Apple might have to change the way that works. And I think the second you

686
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,100
Speaker 1:  kind of step into the law will change the way the phone works.

687
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,940
Speaker 1:  The controversy will get higher and higher. And the rest of the bills, I

688
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,630
Speaker 1:  think had the same price.

689
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And David, miscellany the chairman of the committee who helped with

690
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Speaker 5:  all of these bills. It confirmed in a press conference this week that

691
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,700
Speaker 5:  apple iPhones would not have iMessage on them. By default, if

692
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,450
Speaker 5:  these bills go through, they would not have, you know, calendar or

693
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,540
Speaker 5:  all of the services that we're used to. You know, when you turn on the iPhone

694
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,740
Speaker 5:  and it has all of the apple services that we use every day, or, you

695
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,710
Speaker 5:  know, that also have competitors on the app store too.

696
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,180
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I just, I mean, God bless him. He went hard. He

697
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,900
Speaker 1:  told us he would. And he did. I just don't know if that's going to be a winning

698
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,740
Speaker 1:  argument. And so that's when I say like, this feels like a negotiation and

699
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,480
Speaker 1:  they put five chips on the table. Like I wonder, you know, you've

700
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,220
Speaker 1:  reported, these are going to go into markup soon. They're going to change

701
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,000
Speaker 1:  a little bit. I'm wondering if you see, if you see these bills as

702
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,030
Speaker 1:  being written, such that when they get walked back, they're still

703
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,700
Speaker 5:  Right. So of course they had to come out swinging on something like this

704
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,720
Speaker 5:  after such a long investigation. And then after like

705
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,870
Speaker 5:  that huge hearing last year, you know, where they brought in

706
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,770
Speaker 5:  Jeff Bezos and mark Zuckerberg and everyone, they really had to go hard on

707
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:52,700
Speaker 5:  this. And so it's anticipated that these bills will go

708
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,630
Speaker 5:  to markup next week, right. That is incredibly fast.

709
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,530
Speaker 5:  That is ridiculous momentum for Congress on something like this,

710
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,250
Speaker 5:  especially something that is, that would in theory, if all these go through

711
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,910
Speaker 5:  enact like such radical change to the tech

712
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,750
Speaker 5:  industry. And of course, I mean, a lot of these bills, a

713
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,020
Speaker 5:  lot of these bills like introduced are just to kind of spook companies a

714
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,860
Speaker 5:  little bit, but I, I do see there's already come out.

715
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,850
Speaker 5:  People have already come out in Congress saying that these bills

716
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,050
Speaker 5:  support big tech companies rather than do anything

717
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:31,040
Speaker 5:  to dampen competition or help, you

718
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,610
Speaker 5:  know, benefit competition. And the house GOP leader

719
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,270
Speaker 5:  leader, McCarthy already said, like, we're not going to let these go

720
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,170
Speaker 5:  anywhere. So I think in order to get them through the

721
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,860
Speaker 5:  house and, you know, caucus leaders will either have to

722
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,340
Speaker 5:  rewrite some of the language, really take a step back and see how this affects

723
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,210
Speaker 5:  the real world, how this affects devices and users before any of them can

724
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,420
Speaker 5:  really move to the floor for a final vote. Okay.

725
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,600
Speaker 1:  We, we, we stopped it three of the five bills. What are the last two days?

726
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,440
Speaker 1:  Right.

727
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,340
Speaker 5:  So I mean like another one is just blocking companies like Facebook from

728
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,220
Speaker 5:  buying nascent competitors. We've talked about this all the time, like the

729
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,120
Speaker 5:  2012 acquisition of Instagram. So basically companies would be

730
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,810
Speaker 5:  forbidden from buying companies like that. And how, how do you,

731
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,740
Speaker 5:  you know, understand what is initially, you know, what could be a competitor,

732
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,640
Speaker 5:  but could be not, that's kind of up for grabs. So that's the second to last

733
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,070
Speaker 5:  one. And then the other one is

734
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:29,260
Speaker 5:  barring companies from giving their own surfaces preference over

735
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,980
Speaker 5:  rivals. So I think the classic example of that is in

736
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,970
Speaker 5:  Google search, Google having its own products at the top of

737
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,960
Speaker 5:  the page, rather than other companies like Yelp or things like

738
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,010
Speaker 5:  that. Yeah.

739
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:46,060
Speaker 1:  And again, I think all of those sound great, all of them are going to get

740
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,990
Speaker 1:  significant pushback, but your point that

741
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,830
Speaker 1:  you've brought up several times now, there is a pretty huge set of

742
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,490
Speaker 1:  Republicans and Democrats who are like, this is what we need to

743
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:01,330
Speaker 1:  do. We need to push it really hard. And I,

744
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,120
Speaker 1:  you know, the, the last set of

745
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,920
Speaker 1:  tech regulation proposals that we talked about was two 30.

746
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,790
Speaker 1:  We've talked about it endlessly. And we're kind of like both sides want different

747
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:16,180
Speaker 1:  things. They're just mad. And like, here's a place where they can be mad

748
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,870
Speaker 1:  together, but they actually have different goals here they're upset. And

749
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,470
Speaker 1:  it seems like their goals are aligned and they're moving forward to achieve

750
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,280
Speaker 1:  the same results in a way that I think the poisonous

751
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,160
Speaker 1:  two 30 conversation has made people think nothing will ever happen.

752
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,650
Speaker 5:  Right. And I think if you talk to policy, think tank people in DC, you talk

753
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,550
Speaker 5:  to lawmakers, you talk to Republicans and Democrats, folks are really more

754
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,450
Speaker 5:  aligned when it comes to antitrust because they do believe, I mean, for

755
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,900
Speaker 5:  Republicans, they're still mad. They're still tweeting about parlor being

756
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,590
Speaker 5:  kicked off the app store partners back, but they're still really mad about

757
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:53,550
Speaker 5:  it. Right? And they want to make sure that there's more competition in

758
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,550
Speaker 5:  the market that Facebook can't, you know, dominate everything that we can

759
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,120
Speaker 5:  have these more conservative entrance in the market and competition reform

760
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,990
Speaker 5:  helps that in theory. And then when you think about other

761
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,770
Speaker 5:  concerns that, you know, company Democrats have

762
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,740
Speaker 5:  having to do with pricing, or just like

763
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:15,330
Speaker 5:  small business concerns or all these kinds of things, they really do align

764
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,720
Speaker 5:  on competition is this is something where Republicans and Democrats can really

765
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,650
Speaker 5:  move forward together. And we saw that this week at the press conference,

766
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,790
Speaker 5:  it is, it was just ridiculous to see somebody like 10 bucks, the

767
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,360
Speaker 5:  ranking member of the house. And she trusts committee at this press conference

768
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,140
Speaker 5:  supporting all of these bills. After when the investigation

769
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,920
Speaker 5:  ended last year, he authored his own report. He did not agree with a

770
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,760
Speaker 5:  single thing. The Democrats came up with an offer a date third

771
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,660
Speaker 5:  way report. Right? So just looking at Ken

772
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,530
Speaker 5:  Buck's specifically in his evolution on this and his, you know, his thinking

773
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:53,340
Speaker 5:  on this changing, I think it really makes the case

774
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,460
Speaker 5:  that these could move forward and more Republicans could probably be swayed

775
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,400
Speaker 5:  to vote for these bills, kind

776
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,000
Speaker 1:  Of the, the wonky thing at the heart of this, and, you know,

777
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,960
Speaker 1:  connected to Lina Khan in her lottery

778
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,890
Speaker 1:  paper was the idea of the consumer welfare standard that we shouldn't look

779
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,820
Speaker 1:  at things unless we can prove that prices go up. These companies

780
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,780
Speaker 1:  all controlled prices to the cents they can make or not make

781
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,410
Speaker 1:  profits as they wish. So it was very difficult to use that standard.

782
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,530
Speaker 1:  That's not in here, right. They're not changing that. It was the thing that

783
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:28,100
Speaker 1:  Ken buck really didn't want to do. And it seems like they just set that

784
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,000
Speaker 1:  aside and they went with much more direct approaches to

785
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,040
Speaker 1:  regulating the companies, which is really interesting to me.

786
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah, definitely. And I think even some Democrats have strayed away

787
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,900
Speaker 5:  from, you know, changing the consumer welfare standard. I think Amy Klobuchar

788
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,170
Speaker 5:  was on the coder talking about it too. And I think you asked her about it

789
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,570
Speaker 5:  and she didn't have a very straightforward answer.

790
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,840
Speaker 5:  It's a very testy subject. And that's one that I see having

791
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:58,340
Speaker 5:  more problems on both parties, you know, than what was proposed in the bills

792
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:58,730
Speaker 5:  this week.

793
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,580
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's just, it's, it's interesting to me is we talk about, you know,

794
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:05,330
Speaker 1:  bipartisan solutions, something like let's change. The legal

795
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:09,320
Speaker 1:  standard is like up in the clouds, right? Like

796
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,800
Speaker 1:  it's, well, let's change the law. And they're like, we'll try a new enforcement

797
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,700
Speaker 1:  way and way of thinking. And you would almost expect that to

798
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,390
Speaker 1:  work better than this set of bills, which is

799
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,200
Speaker 1:  like, I'm reaching into your iPhone and taking the calendar app

800
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,650
Speaker 1:  off of it. Right. Which is much as there's a much more direct

801
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:31,480
Speaker 1:  government intervention products and services. And yet

802
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,050
Speaker 1:  it has just been really surprising to me. That's where everyone has gone.

803
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,440
Speaker 1:  They're like, we're just going to reach into the products. And we're going

804
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,430
Speaker 1:  to D rank Google Google's own products and put Yelp at the top.

805
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,610
Speaker 1:  And that's what we want to have happen. So the government is going to basically

806
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:49,360
Speaker 1:  say this has to happen. Whereas at least with the consumer, it was like,

807
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,410
Speaker 1:  it was just so much more airy. Like we're going to change the way we

808
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:57,400
Speaker 1:  think about the market, which is like, you can

809
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,310
Speaker 1:  just glue any emotion you want onto that. And that's how you bring people

810
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,080
Speaker 1:  together. And that's just not what happened here at all.

811
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,370
Speaker 2:  I think deep down, every single congressional representative wants

812
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:10,290
Speaker 2:  to be a product manager. So this is what they want. You know, they, they

813
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,450
Speaker 2:  they've used the calendar app. They're annoyed by the button placement. They

814
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:17,440
Speaker 2:  think the round wrecks are a little bit off there. Just do it better themselves.

815
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,130
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

816
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,580
Speaker 1:  And none of them know how to fix content moderation. So we're going to do

817
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,000
Speaker 1:  to father

818
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,590
Speaker 1:  McKenna what's next in his, in this complicated process.

819
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,780
Speaker 5:  Great. So next week is the markup. And I think that is when we're

820
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,620
Speaker 5:  really going to hear the problems that other lawmakers have with these bills.

821
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:38,790
Speaker 5:  I mean, this organization called the internet accountability project, came

822
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,570
Speaker 5:  out with a list this morning of Republicans asking people to call

823
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:46,080
Speaker 5:  them and tell them to vote for these. They were like, Jim Jordan, there are

824
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,010
Speaker 5:  these very, you know, right. Populous leaning folks

825
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,910
Speaker 5:  who would rather change all this stuff through to 30. So there's some activism

826
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:57,840
Speaker 5:  building now, even within the parties to get people to vote for

827
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,290
Speaker 5:  these. But next week we will see all the gripes people have. We will see

828
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,770
Speaker 5:  amendments send to these bills to change the language. And

829
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,270
Speaker 5:  then hopefully in the next couple of weeks, we'll see the finalized

830
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,660
Speaker 5:  language. It'll get a vote out and

831
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,350
Speaker 5:  maybe we'll see what the Senate comes up with because Clover charts that

832
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,230
Speaker 5:  she was going to try and introduce companion bills to these in the Senate.

833
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,890
Speaker 5:  So they can have momentum on both sides of Congress. Amazing.

834
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:26,790
Speaker 1:  I really do think kind of the tech industry's response to this has been well,

835
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:30,660
Speaker 1:  nothing ever happens, but like things are going to happen. Everyone

836
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,710
Speaker 1:  was spooked. They all

837
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,920
Speaker 5:  Had these. They all had these statements and all these examples ready for

838
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,250
Speaker 5:  how the world was going to change with these. It's, it's an, it's an unusual

839
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,640
Speaker 5:  amount of momentum for something this radical from Congress, for sure.

840
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,210
Speaker 1:  And maybe one day it will be illegal to put LinkedIn in Microsoft word.

841
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,830
Speaker 1:  I was like, read that tweet. I was like, is this really the best he got?

842
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,640
Speaker 1:  Like, everyone's happy about that. They kind of, well, it sounds like we're

843
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,790
Speaker 1:  going to have you back on several times as this keeps going. Thank you for

844
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,950
Speaker 1:  coming on. It was great talking to you. Yeah, no, it's great to be here.

845
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,340
Speaker 3:  This episode is brought to you by masterworks.io. The total value of

846
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,580
Speaker 3:  the art market is massive. Deloitte estimates it to be

847
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:15,480
Speaker 3:  $1.7 trillion. That's trillion with a T,

848
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,290
Speaker 3:  but you don't have to go to a stuffy auction house to get involved. It might

849
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,930
Speaker 3:  be a little known asset class, but the super wealthy have been putting their

850
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,650
Speaker 3:  money into it for a while. Fine art. And I don't mean

851
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,420
Speaker 3:  buying the art itself. masterworks.io is a premier membership

852
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,380
Speaker 3:  platform for investing in finance. In fact, masterworks has seen contemporary

853
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,770
Speaker 3:  art prices beat the S and P by 174%. Since

854
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:40,760
Speaker 3:  1995, you can invest in multi-million dollar works by artists like

855
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,390
Speaker 3:  Banksy, Warhol, and Basquiat. It's a great way for everyday

856
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:48,320
Speaker 3:  investors to diversify into fine art without breaking the big masterworks

857
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,220
Speaker 3:  thinks maybe there's a reason why 86% of wealth managers recommend investing

858
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,000
Speaker 3:  in art. Their waitlist has exploded, but listeners to this show can hop the

Speaker 6:  knock knees and oh, a massive four blade kin. She

863

Speaker 6:  uses as a boomerang weapon. You're picturing UV from final fantasy

Speaker 6:  the rebellious Wu tight ninja infiltrates the capital city of mid

868
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,480
Speaker 6:  Gar and conspires with the eco terrorist group avalanche, the steal,

869
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,410
Speaker 6:  the ultimate materia from the Shinra electric power company. If none

870
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:46,280
Speaker 6:  of this means anything to you, you're missing out. Remake integrated

871
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,820
Speaker 6:  features a leap in the quality of the graphics. There's better lighting and

872
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,510
Speaker 6:  background environments that make the visuals oh, much better. You can switch

873
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,990
Speaker 6:  between graphics mode to play in 4k or performance mode for

874
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,890
Speaker 6:  super smooth action at 60 frames per second. And that

875
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,670
Speaker 6:  should make for fantastic photos by the way, with the fully customizable

876
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:08,180
Speaker 6:  photo mode, a great option for capturing photos of your

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,600
Speaker 6:  that will have the next gen visuals. FF seven episode intermission

881
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,500
Speaker 6:  is available as a separate purchase. Looks like this'll be a fun ride,

882
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,910
Speaker 6:  Alex. Cranz welcome. Hey, glad to be here.

883
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,640
Speaker 1:  Yeah, you're, you've been a real hit these past basket weeks. All the tweets

884
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,360
Speaker 1:  are coming in.

885
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:41,110
Speaker 7:  I feel so loved. Like I love getting all these tweets. Not many

886
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:44,440
Speaker 7:  people slid into my DMS to complain about

887
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,770
Speaker 7:  putting their, their task bars stuff on the right side of their screen though,

888
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,970
Speaker 7:  which was very surprising.

889
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,930
Speaker 1:  We really did ignite kind of a long, a long running

890
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:55,450
Speaker 1:  Twitter battle. I think we can list one person

891
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:59,410
Speaker 2:  To move their doc from the side to the bottom. I saw that if you can, if

892
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,680
Speaker 2:  you can improve one person's life, it's all worth it. Amazing.

893
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,770
Speaker 7:  I felt so good about it. It just really felt helpful.

894
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,640
Speaker 1:  All right. Well, no pressure. Your goal here is to improve one person's life.

895
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:15,460
Speaker 1:  Don't stress. Alright, Dieter, lots of

896
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,760
Speaker 1:  gadget news, lots of stuff to go through, but feel like we're just going

897
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,510
Speaker 1:  to spend most of this segment with you explaining to me what on

898
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:25,440
Speaker 1:  earth is going on with RCS encryption in Google?

899
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,100
Speaker 2:  It's actually very simple. What happened with RCS encryption

900
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,300
Speaker 2:  is if you use Android messages and you've got, you know, Google

901
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,050
Speaker 2:  providing, if you're using edited messages, basically you can get encryption

902
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:40,920
Speaker 2:  for one-to-one messages. If you're using the beta and starting this

903
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,520
Speaker 2:  week, they started rolling that out to a

904
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,360
Speaker 2:  regular people that aren't on the beta. So in the near future,

905
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,020
Speaker 2:  once the rollout is finished, if you are having a one-to-one RCS message,

906
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,220
Speaker 2:  you will be encrypted. You have the option to have those messages be end

907
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,030
Speaker 2:  to end encrypted. That's kind of it, they rolled it out kind of quietly,

908
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:03,690
Speaker 2:  like surprisingly quietly, like stupidly

909
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,080
Speaker 2:  annoying.

910
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,910
Speaker 1:  He in real time Hiroshi Lockheimer it's like

911
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:11,840
Speaker 1:  tweeting out. We've added RCS. We've got an encryption RCS

912
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:15,860
Speaker 1:  he's tweeting like retweeting photos of his sticky notes

913
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:19,010
Speaker 1:  from the last time he was on the verge cast. Yeah. Well it's like, oh, this

914
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:20,240
Speaker 1:  is all happening at once. Yeah,

915
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:24,080
Speaker 2:  There was a bunch of like minor Android updates that came out alongside this

916
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:27,770
Speaker 2:  emoji mashups and some other earthquake detection in more countries and whatever.

917
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,820
Speaker 2:  Here's my thing. I do not want to be known as the world's

918
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:35,570
Speaker 2:  foremost, RCS, Stan. I think RCS is fundamentally a

919
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,290
Speaker 2:  compromise

920
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,560
Speaker 1:  Product. I'm so sorry. He did hurt many, many problems.

921
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:43,310
Speaker 2:  I think that it's broken in so many ways.

922
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,180
Speaker 2:  However, I also think that we live in a fallen

923
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,360
Speaker 2:  universe and it's the best we're going to get

924
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:55,010
Speaker 2:  for cross-device encrypted communication that isn't

925
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:58,580
Speaker 2:  controlled by a single company, right? That's just bleak.

926
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:02,510
Speaker 2:  It's technically Google runs a bunch of stuff, but like technically RCS doesn't

927
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,270
Speaker 2:  need to be controlled by a single company. You know, you can have servers

928
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:08,570
Speaker 2:  run by any number of carriers. I wish that it could be more independent like

929
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:12,140
Speaker 2:  signal, but for default on device communication, that is

930
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:16,040
Speaker 2:  encrypted. RCS is the thing that will work across all devices

931
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:20,400
Speaker 2:  except I-phones within the next year. And so I am like official. I

932
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,380
Speaker 2:  like tweeted, like it's time apple it's time for you to support RCS.

933
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:27,680
Speaker 2:  That's actually the thing that you could do that would protect your own customer's

934
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,640
Speaker 2:  privacy because of an iPhone customer tries to use their default messaging

935
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,570
Speaker 2:  app to text an Android customer. They have less privacy than if

936
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,540
Speaker 2:  they had an Android phone and they were texting that Android customer. Yeah.

937
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:42,350
Speaker 2:  And so I tweeted this, not quite that vociferously. Yeah.

938
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,460
Speaker 2:  Tim cook like it, no, it was the product

939
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,270
Speaker 2:  lead for Android messages, Sonata, Hari from Google. And she

940
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:54,110
Speaker 2:  said she welcomes everyone to participate in RCS. Oh, that's nice. If

941
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:54,380
Speaker 2:  you're

942
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,740
Speaker 1:  A high profile, Google product manager, that's as spicy as you can get.

943
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,270
Speaker 1:  That's it? I welcome everyone

944
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,620
Speaker 1:  specifically one company that I will not name, but they are

945
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,430
Speaker 1:  welcomed here.

946
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:13,970
Speaker 1:  All right. So that's RCS and then there's other Google messaging. This is

947
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,850
Speaker 1:  what I mean when I say there's, there's a lot on the list.

948
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:20,780
Speaker 2:  So if you have RCS available to you, you know that RCS is available to you

949
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,490
Speaker 2:  because it says that you could enable chat. Google has

950
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,120
Speaker 2:  another product called Google chat, which is not RCS, which is Google

951
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,900
Speaker 2:  chat. That's built into Google workspace

952
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,710
Speaker 2:  Cibele

953
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,270
Speaker 2:  and it is now available to everybody. So if you have a Gmail account, you

954
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,450
Speaker 2:  can go into settings and like flip on the new experience of all the new cool

955
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:44,320
Speaker 2:  Google workspace stuff, the smart campus chips and Google chat

956
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,220
Speaker 2:  conversations and Google chat rooms and Google

957
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,340
Speaker 2:  meet in your toolbar at the bottom, you can have all the new stuff it's available

958
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:55,330
Speaker 2:  to everybody. And that's the news. It was very difficult

959
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:58,840
Speaker 2:  for me to understand that was a news based on Google's blog post about, about

960
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,830
Speaker 2:  all this, but it's there and hurry. You can go turn it on.

961
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:05,500
Speaker 2:  Everything is that's, that's the whole story. There's nothing more complicated

962
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,950
Speaker 2:  about that. Oh, except they're going to change the names of rooms to

963
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,670
Speaker 2:  spaces. Don't know why they're going to evolve rooms into spaces. And they're

964
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,920
Speaker 2:  going to, they're going to start doing new stuff. And like spaces are going

965
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,730
Speaker 2:  to compete with everything from like old email list serves to

966
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,990
Speaker 2:  discord to slack is my understanding. Why

967
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:24,330
Speaker 1:  Don't they just make one product called G chat?

968
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:28,770
Speaker 2:  Well, there is a product called Google chat. Now finally, no G chat O

969
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:31,920
Speaker 2:  U N G chat. There was never a product called G chat. It never existed.

970
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,120
Speaker 1:  I know. I understand. Yeah. It's like that movie, but I

971
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,750
Speaker 1:  have fond memories of it. Right. It is the best. Why don't they

972
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,500
Speaker 1:  just make that product and put it on phones and

973
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,220
Speaker 1:  inside of these services and then like use their

974
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,830
Speaker 1:  dominance to win

975
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,330
Speaker 2:  Because they're afraid of antitrust even that's it? Yeah, no, I absolutely

976
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,430
Speaker 2:  think that's it. I think that's the whole reason they went with this weird

977
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:59,970
Speaker 2:  federated RCS thing on Android. You could, you could install, chat on your

978
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:03,120
Speaker 2:  Android phone. It'll probably be on deck. And like, what are the default

979
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,880
Speaker 2:  apps? It's just not the default texting experience

980
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,940
Speaker 1:  Doing it's antitrust or carriers. Yes. Okay.

981
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,440
Speaker 1:  I would offer this criticism of Google and I'm curious what you both think

982
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,040
Speaker 1:  of this right now. We just came out of IO and they, you know, they had their,

983
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,520
Speaker 1:  their usual big ideas that IO and machine learning is going to

984
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,600
Speaker 1:  drive a car and draw a picture and do all this stuff it's going to do. But

985
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,380
Speaker 1:  Google from a product perspective has been in slow motion for a long

986
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:35,370
Speaker 1:  time. Right? Like they rename a bunch of stuff. They move stuff

987
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,300
Speaker 1:  around. They like welcome partners. Some

988
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:43,200
Speaker 1:  partners don't show up in like, Google makes a sad, that's the true

989
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,830
Speaker 1:  flock to their, their ad thing. You know, their

990
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:50,780
Speaker 1:  hardware division, total slow motion. Oh, but

991
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:54,150
Speaker 1:  they got a store now and Eli in New York. Yeah. They got it. But I was like,

992
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,910
Speaker 1:  that's actually what made me think of this? Like they opened their first

993
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:00,840
Speaker 1:  retail store and it's like a bunch of stuff that has been out for over a

994
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,020
Speaker 1:  year that all fundamentally works the same as the stuff that was out the

995
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:08,010
Speaker 1:  year before it. And I was just like, is it antitrust? Is Google

996
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:11,940
Speaker 1:  just afraid of doing stuff? Because someone will yell at them. It's just

997
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:15,600
Speaker 1:  weird that they're kind of like treading water. Am I the only one who like

998
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:16,350
Speaker 1:  perceives this?

999
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:20,370
Speaker 7:  No, I think you're, you're totally right. They, they just sorta sit

1000
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,060
Speaker 7:  there with

1001
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,760
Speaker 1:  Just raking in cash, controlling the internet

1002
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,170
Speaker 7:  And they control everything. But then there's all these tools that we use

1003
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,920
Speaker 7:  that people use. And they're like, no, but don't use that or like

1004
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:36,130
Speaker 7:  use it, but don't use it like the way we want you to you, you would normally

1005
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,470
Speaker 7:  use something. We're not going to let you do that. You're you're going to

1006
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:42,070
Speaker 7:  have to like work for it. And it's like, but that's antithetical to what

1007
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,580
Speaker 7:  Google is, which is I never have to work for it. I just get it for free.

1008
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:49,350
Speaker 7:  And I give you all of my data. So it's just like, they're,

1009
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:53,260
Speaker 7:  they're just kinda shrugging. It feels like

1010
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,620
Speaker 7:  just a big shrug emoji and like all of their, all of the stuff that I would

1011
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,280
Speaker 7:  normally find very interesting and be excited about. They kind of like

1012
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:05,470
Speaker 7:  it when they announce it, like every single announcement, it's just

1013
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:08,710
Speaker 7:  like, sort of like, oh yeah. And we also did this and we're going to announce

1014
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:11,740
Speaker 7:  it like three weeks later, it'd be really confusing about it. And

1015
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,970
Speaker 7:  also, I didn't know, like, I didn't know, for six months that Google

1016
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,540
Speaker 7:  Hangouts have become Google meets, like I saw the press

1017
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:23,290
Speaker 7:  release and I understood it, but I didn't understand it until one

1018
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:26,320
Speaker 7:  day when I was like, I can't find the app on my phone anymore.

1019
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,100
Speaker 7:  <inaudible> you out

1020
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,370
Speaker 7:  now? Well, it looks exact Sam. Yeah. Yeah.

1021
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,150
Speaker 1:  No, everything is a phased rollout. Right? So you kind of never know when

1022
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:40,600
Speaker 1:  things are happening. I don't know. You pay more attention to Google than

1023
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,900
Speaker 1:  almost anybody. I know you haven't, your status is the only person who understands

1024
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,050
Speaker 1:  RCS, which you have, if you want it or not.

1025
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,820
Speaker 1:  Is that perception accurate or are they just like doing a lot of things that

1026
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,750
Speaker 1:  we don't see? I think

1027
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,890
Speaker 2:  The perception is accurate for a bunch of their consumer stuff. I think that

1028
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,770
Speaker 2:  one of the things that's going on with this Google workspace stuff is they

1029
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:03,490
Speaker 2:  actually have started making stuff and doing stuff. And

1030
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:06,940
Speaker 2:  that is feels weird. And I think it feels weird for Google to, and so they

1031
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,650
Speaker 2:  don't know how to talk about it because when

1032
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:12,400
Speaker 1:  They start making something like here's some new thing, words,

1033
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,480
Speaker 2:  Words about the thing.

1034
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,180
Speaker 2:  But yeah. I mean hardware, especially, I don't want to have existential

1035
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:23,080
Speaker 2:  feelings about the pixel for the thousandth time right now, but I

1036
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,050
Speaker 2:  don't know, like this is the year where they're going to have their own processor

1037
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:29,380
Speaker 2:  and hopefully they'll do something with the camera and it's going to have

1038
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:33,310
Speaker 2:  this wacky new design. This is the year where like they really

1039
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:37,150
Speaker 2:  need, they they've got a store, a store. I think that they're getting close

1040
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:39,850
Speaker 2:  to put up or shut up time for their hardware efforts. They bought Fitbit.

1041
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,670
Speaker 2:  They're going to have a watch. The watch has got a whole new operating system

1042
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:46,750
Speaker 2:  that is, you know, merged with ties in, in some way. So there's a

1043
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:50,140
Speaker 2:  bunch of consumer stuff where they really need to show

1044
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:54,430
Speaker 2:  that they can be directly relevant. And if they can't, they

1045
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:58,420
Speaker 2:  should just like stop and let Samsung just own everything.

1046
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:01,810
Speaker 2:  While I was in there for a second where they maybe they were going to try

1047
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:05,440
Speaker 2:  and like Google is going to like have an ecosystem of multiple hardware vendors

1048
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,250
Speaker 2:  making great stuff. But they got banned honor is back now, which

1049
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:13,030
Speaker 2:  used to be Hawaii division or whatever, they seem fine.

1050
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:16,690
Speaker 2:  But yeah, in general, I think that Google has not told a compelling

1051
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,190
Speaker 2:  regular user story for a while now.

1052
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,420
Speaker 1:  Yeah. You know, you said antitrust and I would actually, I would, to me,

1053
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:27,960
Speaker 1:  it's the flip side of antitrust. Google makes so much

1054
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,740
Speaker 1:  money doing exactly what it did yesterday. Did it

1055
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,650
Speaker 1:  hasn't really had any existential pressure to figure out what it's going

1056
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,490
Speaker 1:  to do tomorrow. Right. Right. Like they can do

1057
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:42,450
Speaker 1:  nothing in print money from the advertising business.

1058
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,470
Speaker 1:  And every time they kind of like stray away from that, like

1059
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,980
Speaker 1:  eventually the grownups come by and they're like, no, no, no, hold on, go

1060
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,970
Speaker 1:  back to collecting the money. Right? Like what are we doing? Why are we

1061
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,240
Speaker 1:  spending money when we could just make money for no. And I know this is like

1062
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,820
Speaker 1:  very reductive and I know a lot of Google people listen to this and like,

1063
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,560
Speaker 1:  yeah, I'm being a little unfair, but where's the new stuff.

1064
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,460
Speaker 1:  Like where's the big, the next big idea from Google that isn't an

1065
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,850
Speaker 1:  AI demo that I just keep thinking about

1066
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:16,410
Speaker 1:  two, three hours ago, they had that, we're going to take the fence out of

1067
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:19,950
Speaker 1:  the photo demo and it never shipped. We haven't seen it

1068
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,160
Speaker 1:  last year. They had Google assistant is going to make you a dry cleaning

1069
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,500
Speaker 1:  appointment. That's sort

1070
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,340
Speaker 2:  Of half shipping a little bit here and there. Like it happens. It

1071
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,790
Speaker 2:  pops up in the assistant. It's just like, like Alex, you had a pop-up for

1072
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,790
Speaker 2:  you once recently. Didn't you? I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

1073
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,460
Speaker 1:  But that's even better. But by, by that phased rollout, like, I don't know

1074
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,320
Speaker 1:  if that's out or not. Right? Yeah. You

1075
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,830
Speaker 7:  Can't get hyped about it because it's like, well, I'll get it four years

1076
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:46,070
Speaker 7:  from now. And I will have forgotten that it was happening. You'd be like,

1077
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,760
Speaker 7:  oh, this is a nice pleasant change of pace. You guys mentioned the

1078
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,720
Speaker 7:  antitrust and I've put on like my little tinfoil hat. Like you've completely

1079
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,930
Speaker 7:  like convinced me it's primary colored. Right? Like it's in Google colors,

1080
01:03:56,930 --> 01:04:00,560
Speaker 7:  but it's tin underneath. But like, it really

1081
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,130
Speaker 7:  does feel like they almost don't want us

1082
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:07,910
Speaker 7:  because this stuff is successful. Like as much as we all complain about,

1083
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,540
Speaker 7:  like these rollouts are slow and boring and all this other stuff, like the

1084
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:15,440
Speaker 7:  pixel phone is, is, is still, it's not Samsung, but it still

1085
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:19,070
Speaker 7:  sells a lot of phones. It sells a lot more phones than a lot of other companies

1086
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:19,790
Speaker 7:  we talk about.

1087
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,630
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But that's like a low there's like Samsung. And then like,

1088
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:27,800
Speaker 1:  you know, the bar, the bottom of the bar chart is just like a blend of colors

1089
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,070
Speaker 1:  that adds up to brown or whatever. And like Google has the biggest slice

1090
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,140
Speaker 1:  of the brown mess at the bottom of the bar chart.

1091
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:35,870
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I don't think they're outselling, LG and LG. It was like, this isn't

1092
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:36,380
Speaker 2:  worth it anymore.

1093
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:40,820
Speaker 1:  There was reports say the LG exited the smartphone business so hard that

1094
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,480
Speaker 1:  apple is talking about selling I-phones and LGS stores in Korea. Oh my

1095
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,050
Speaker 1:  God. That's how hard I was. She was out there like there's literally a

1096
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,850
Speaker 1:  vacuum in the store. Would you like to fill it?

1097
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,570
Speaker 2:  So we started the podcast talking about windows and how windows is sort of

1098
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:57,530
Speaker 2:  trapped by needing to be backwards compatible even now, even still.

1099
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,850
Speaker 2:  And Google is trapped by its size. It needs it. Android is like

1100
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:04,610
Speaker 2:  the most used operating system, the planet 3 billion plus people. Right?

1101
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:08,630
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Everybody uses Google. Everybody uses Chrome. Anything that

1102
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:12,560
Speaker 2:  Google does as bigger repercussions. And they just get

1103
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,460
Speaker 2:  spooked by that. And sometimes that's for good reason. But other

1104
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,970
Speaker 2:  times it's it's I think it's maybe slowing him down.

1105
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:23,110
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I just think it's we just came off talking to McKenna with all these,

1106
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:27,100
Speaker 1:  this antitrust action happening and you can see it in two ways. One, they

1107
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:30,550
Speaker 1:  don't want to do anything cause they'll get yelled at and two, they don't

1108
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:33,910
Speaker 1:  have to do anything. Cause they're already printing money is

1109
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,930
Speaker 1:  the foremost member of the advertising duopoly on the internet.

1110
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:41,200
Speaker 1:  And so like, why would you do anything if you're going to get yelled at and

1111
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,140
Speaker 1:  it won't make you as much money as the money, you can just collect by waking

1112
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,890
Speaker 1:  up every day and like, yep. That's why competition is good. Like

1113
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:51,670
Speaker 1:  something has to break that open. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if these

1114
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:54,370
Speaker 1:  bills are going to do it, but it's just it's I don't know. Google used to

1115
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:57,880
Speaker 1:  do a lot of things all the time. They used to have gigantic

1116
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:01,870
Speaker 1:  ideas and then like ship them at like big scale.

1117
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:03,250
Speaker 1:  And like, I don't know,

1118
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,230
Speaker 7:  Like yeah, but they also like failed at all of them, right? Like

1119
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:07,860
Speaker 7:  wave.

1120
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:10,470
Speaker 2:  Yes. Yeah.

1121
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:12,270
Speaker 2:  In

1122
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:15,150
Speaker 1:  Platform where this week Casey wrote about how Facebook is making, making

1123
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,840
Speaker 1:  a bunch of VR acquisitions and kind of the thesis. He was riffing off some

1124
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,710
Speaker 1:  tweets from our own out teeth. Facebook is like buying VR

1125
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:25,290
Speaker 1:  game studios. So they're going to have this commanding lead by the time this

1126
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:28,500
Speaker 1:  becomes a real market. And I was like, well, yeah, but there's they have

1127
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,950
Speaker 1:  no competition. Like who are they preventing those game studios from working

1128
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:35,220
Speaker 1:  with no one, like, there's not

1129
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:40,200
Speaker 1:  like it's, it's no one. And it's just funny. Cause it could have

1130
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,560
Speaker 1:  been Google. They were like headed in that direction and they just kind of

1131
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,520
Speaker 1:  pulled the plug. And like, I dunno, I didn't mean to get that all

1132
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,940
Speaker 1:  is essential, like Google, but it's, it just, it was just looking at pictures

1133
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,130
Speaker 1:  of this store. And I was like, well, I already have all this stuff.

1134
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:57,420
Speaker 7:  You can go and sit in the store in one of the chairs in

1135
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:01,320
Speaker 7:  place stadia, which like maybe the Internet's

1136
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,710
Speaker 7:  really good there. Right. That's that's my only reason to think to go with

1137
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:07,800
Speaker 1:  That source itself as Google fiber, then everyone would go to that store.

1138
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,040
Speaker 7:  Yep. Yeah. I would live there. Just get like a little coffee in the background.

1139
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:11,580
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Okay.

1140
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,190
Speaker 1:  All right. Dinner. There's a lot of just like little Ghazni he's going to

1141
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,270
Speaker 1:  go through it. Yeah. I

1142
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:18,540
Speaker 2:  Dunno. Like there's a bunch of stuff. I think the one that caught captured

1143
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:21,690
Speaker 2:  the most attention in the verge was probably Ikea finally shipped their picture

1144
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:21,960
Speaker 2:  frame

1145
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,390
Speaker 1:  Speaker, but it's like, it's a, it's a big

1146
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:27,420
Speaker 2:  Fabric thing. You can put different fabrics on the top of it. It's a flat

1147
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:31,250
Speaker 2:  speaker. It seems good. I don't know. Flat speaker

1148
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:35,430
Speaker 7:  If I had a home that was not a New York

1149
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:39,000
Speaker 7:  apartment where I think you guys can actually see my entire apartment

1150
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:43,110
Speaker 7:  from, from the camera view, I would a hundred percent get that. Like you

1151
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:47,040
Speaker 7:  put that on a wall on like your second, you know, the landing for your second

1152
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,480
Speaker 7:  floor. That'd be great.

1153
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:52,170
Speaker 1:  This is my theory of, of, of this Sonos market expansion. They're just counting

1154
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:55,530
Speaker 1:  and people buying bigger homes over time. Yeah. And with every home you gotta

1155
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,340
Speaker 1:  buy one more speaker

1156
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,520
Speaker 7:  Long to buy these speakers and have a place to put them

1157
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,970
Speaker 1:  As a company that is just betting on the American dream. More than any other

1158
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:06,930
Speaker 1:  company. It's like, everyone will buy a slightly bigger house over time.

1159
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,220
Speaker 1:  I love them. You know, it's really interesting that center's for now. Is

1160
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,930
Speaker 1:  it almost impossible to buy their products? Yeah. If you want to buy a Sonos

1161
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:15,030
Speaker 1:  one, you're like September.

1162
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:19,220
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I waited almost two months for a Sonos five. Yeah.

1163
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,310
Speaker 1:  I think a people are typing at home. They have bought a lot of the

1164
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:28,240
Speaker 1:  products and then the chip shortage is like real. So it's funny that they're

1165
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,450
Speaker 1:  like, well, you can't have the one you want picture frame

1166
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,320
Speaker 7:  Two picture frames, stereo sound.

1167
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,190
Speaker 1:  You can use them as surrounds or do you have a center,

1168
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:43,270
Speaker 1:  a soundbar, which is amazing. I cannot wait for us to get these intestinal

1169
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,940
Speaker 1:  mandalas plaid.

1170
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:49,930
Speaker 2:  So, so I'm curious what you all think about this? I think it's great. I think

1171
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:53,650
Speaker 2:  that, you know, they improved a bunch of stuff. I think that the yoke

1172
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:57,460
Speaker 2:  steering wheel is the biggest misstep that I've

1173
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,880
Speaker 2:  seen Tesla make in a hot minute. It is,

1174
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,510
Speaker 2:  it just seems really bad. And really like when the, when the, when there

1175
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:07,210
Speaker 2:  was like the center screen on the three and you're like, I don't know, I

1176
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:10,840
Speaker 2:  kind of want something run right in front of the steering wheel, but eventually,

1177
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,440
Speaker 2:  you know, I think they got away with that. I do not think they're going to

1178
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,820
Speaker 2:  get away with this yoke steering wheel.

1179
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,540
Speaker 7:  This feels like eighties concept, car bad.

1180
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,080
Speaker 1:  It's the, it's a stereo from Knight rider. We should just be honest about

1181
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,320
Speaker 1:  what this is. They watched a bunch of episodes, a night rider. And they're

1182
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:30,160
Speaker 1:  like, what if kit's steering wheel was in our car? Yeah. And I,

1183
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:34,210
Speaker 1:  I, I appreciate and support that method of product development. I

1184
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:37,360
Speaker 1:  think they should have done the whoosh thing in the front of the car. We'll

1185
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,720
Speaker 1:  get there. We'll get there slowly, slowly

1186
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:42,370
Speaker 1:  over time they put that light

1187
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,510
Speaker 7:  On there. I will buy it immediately. We're going,

1188
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,920
Speaker 1:  Gonna make this car self-driving without the red Bush thing. I don't know

1189
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,440
Speaker 1:  what it's actually called. I think it's technically called the scanner. You

1190
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,160
Speaker 1:  remember Knight rider, like all of kit's sensor ability

1191
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,960
Speaker 1:  was in the red thing

1192
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,860
Speaker 2:  That went back and forth. Yeah. Yeah. That's the future

1193
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,950
Speaker 2:  under the verge cast, are we talking about 80 TV shows that we remember?

1194
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,240
Speaker 2:  Cause we are super old.

1195
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:08,320
Speaker 1:  The same time Illumina. We had the CEO of Lumina Austin Russell he's

1196
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,010
Speaker 1:  25. He is, makes me feel very old and

1197
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:15,610
Speaker 1:  unsuccessful. See of Luminar LIDAR company. He was on decoder a few months

1198
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:18,940
Speaker 1:  ago. They had an event this week in New York where they were showing off

1199
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:22,350
Speaker 1:  their LIDAR tech and their self-driving stack and how to not set any audience

1200
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:26,260
Speaker 1:  driving in the car. And their dream is that you will be able to identify

1201
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:30,190
Speaker 1:  a self-driving car with Lumina tech because it will have like a piece of

1202
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:34,150
Speaker 1:  hardware on it that isn't a big, silly spinning dome. Right. Right.

1203
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:36,460
Speaker 1:  And they had some like prototypes of what this might look like on various

1204
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:40,420
Speaker 1:  cars. What if it was the night rider thing you see? I'm

1205
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,370
Speaker 1:  trying to bring all the threads together. Like

1206
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,560
Speaker 7:  If he was a little older. Yeah.

1207
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:47,920
Speaker 1:  If only Austin was a little bit older, he would know what I was talking it.

1208
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,470
Speaker 7:  Oh my God. None on the top. We've got to put it under

1209
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:53,500
Speaker 1:  The bumper. You got to make a Trans-Am. Yeah.

1210
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,980
Speaker 1:  And yeah, this yoke thing, I think the reason they're going to get away with

1211
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:00,700
Speaker 1:  it is because this car is so expensive. Yeah.

1212
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,200
Speaker 2:  Right. Like if that's fair,

1213
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:06,310
Speaker 1:  What I think they're not going to get away with is a gear shift on this,

1214
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,120
Speaker 1:  on the screen

1215
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:12,490
Speaker 1:  and turn signals on the wheel. Yeah. That's very video game,

1216
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,170
Speaker 2:  But no, but the didn't I think that they get like a pass from the national

1217
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,580
Speaker 2:  transportation safety board.

1218
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:21,480
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But I mean, Tesla gets a lot of passes for being Tesla all the time.

1219
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:25,280
Speaker 1:  Like I think people are going to buy this car and be like, these buttons

1220
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,280
Speaker 1:  are hard. And I, when I want to go in reverse, I actually just like want

1221
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:32,000
Speaker 1:  to put the car in reverse. Yeah. Not have the car. Try to guess when I want

1222
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,660
Speaker 1:  to be in reverse and maybe get it wrong. And like Tesla's

1223
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:40,310
Speaker 1:  autopilot experiences suggest that it is not as

1224
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:44,120
Speaker 1:  good at guessing what you want is it wants to be. And so like I just,

1225
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:48,320
Speaker 1:  very few people are gonna buy a model as plaid. Some large number of people

1226
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,600
Speaker 1:  are gonna buy a new model. S and I think that's when we're going to see.

1227
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,860
Speaker 1:  Cause if you spend like $150,000 on a car, how much the plan costs, like

1228
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,820
Speaker 1:  you're motivated to be like, this is good. Yeah. Does he come down? I

1229
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,320
Speaker 1:  think it'll be, it'll be different.

1230
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,820
Speaker 2:  I think the last thing I want to talk about is there's a bunch of BBK stuff

1231
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:08,630
Speaker 2:  happening. BBK you may not know, or you may know is the like

1232
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:12,320
Speaker 2:  umbrella company of a bunch of smartphone companies. So

1233
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,850
Speaker 2:  oppo, vivo reel me one plus. So

1234
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:20,480
Speaker 2:  the real me GT standby, forgot to look at it. It is

1235
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:24,350
Speaker 2:  really cool looking and it's, you know, it's like maybe it could have taken

1236
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:28,340
Speaker 2:  up the mantle of flagship killer from one plus APO made a rollable phone.

1237
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:30,920
Speaker 2:  So like it stretches out, just rolls out

1238
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:34,640
Speaker 1:  The thing it does on a screen when it rolls out is like, so chick.

1239
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,780
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So if you're happy, you're looking at the phone, you've got like,

1240
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:42,350
Speaker 1:  I don't know. I think we have a gift with like a webpage.

1241
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:45,290
Speaker 2:  It looks like we're just stretching the image.

1242
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:48,470
Speaker 1:  It stretches the image and then it fades out and it pops back up as normal.

1243
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:51,080
Speaker 1:  And it's like, yeah, that's not what you want.

1244
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:57,170
Speaker 2:  They're not going to ship it because it will only be good for a hundred thousand

1245
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:01,160
Speaker 2:  cycles, a hundred thousand opens, which is enough. Oh, that's well,

1246
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,120
Speaker 2:  they're aiming for 200,000, which is, I dunno, 50 opens a day for five

1247
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:09,020
Speaker 2:  years or something. I dunno. Anyway, the last thing and the saddest thing

1248
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:12,860
Speaker 2:  is one plus is apparently gonna like start working more closely

1249
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:16,460
Speaker 2:  with APO or BBK or just its parent

1250
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:19,670
Speaker 2:  company APO. Yeah. It's going to work more closely with APOE. One plus phones

1251
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:23,660
Speaker 2:  have been like basically redesigned apple phones and vice versa. Nobody ever

1252
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:27,050
Speaker 2:  wanted to admit it. And we kind of just accepted it

1253
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,710
Speaker 2:  and thought of it in terms of like GM had a bunch of different brands and

1254
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:34,460
Speaker 2:  technically at Pontiac and a Chevy were different, but you know, kind of,

1255
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:38,450
Speaker 2:  they weren't, that's how I I've always felt about one plus. Yeah.

1256
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,870
Speaker 2:  And now that's just sort of going back to the mothership a little bit.

1257
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:46,070
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, I think we're seeing the phone market in

1258
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:49,820
Speaker 1:  general consolidate and shrink. Like, it just didn't

1259
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,240
Speaker 1:  happen the way people thought it would happen. That there'd be lots of products

1260
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:57,020
Speaker 1:  and brands, different price points and segments. And so it's like natural,

1261
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,710
Speaker 1:  this is happening, but it's also a, we, we were always like, isn't this aren't

1262
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:04,680
Speaker 1:  you just part of it. And they insisted it wasn't true, but B it's like sad.

1263
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,150
Speaker 1:  Cause it was, they were the Renegade that gots a push.

1264
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,220
Speaker 7:  They were cool. Yeah. They were fun. And I mean, I I've maybe

1265
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,090
Speaker 7:  one of the weird people that actually has fond memories of APO, because

1266
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:19,900
Speaker 7:  like in 2006, if you wanted to watch

1267
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:24,130
Speaker 7:  some anime or something you bought from China, you

1268
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,560
Speaker 7:  needed a region free player and APO had the best

1269
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,080
Speaker 1:  One. Oh yeah. Oh wow.

1270
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:33,700
Speaker 7:  Like APO did the best region, free DVD players. So when I was

1271
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:37,090
Speaker 7:  like, oh, they're getting into phones. I mean, I don't need a region free

1272
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:37,510
Speaker 7:  flow.

1273
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:44,190
Speaker 1:  So I totally forgot that they had dominated the region

1274
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:47,400
Speaker 1:  free. I mean, what else is really saying is that she was a DVD buyer.

1275
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:52,500
Speaker 7:  I had way too many like

1276
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:56,640
Speaker 7:  eBay purchases. I don't know, half of which were legal.

1277
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,620
Speaker 1:  Just great. I mean, we've just seen the FA we're assigning to

1278
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:05,610
Speaker 1:  LG. Like the phone market is just, it's kind of done and people gotta find

1279
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:09,540
Speaker 1:  the next big thing and slop and find the next big thing. Okay. My two

1280
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:13,530
Speaker 1:  things that I want to end on one, so you can have apple and Chris Walsh

1281
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:17,400
Speaker 1:  reviewed the beats studio buds, which are fascinating to me. He thinks they're

1282
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,330
Speaker 1:  pretty good. They do not have an H one ship in them. They do

1283
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:24,960
Speaker 1:  not support things like iCloud sinking between devices. Correct. And

1284
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,860
Speaker 1:  he's theorizing is beats knows that Android has

1285
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:32,160
Speaker 1:  big market for them. And they made a product that worked well with Android

1286
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:35,520
Speaker 1:  phones and they didn't need all the H one stuff, which is,

1287
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:39,930
Speaker 1:  I just think whatever, like apple spent all that money on beads. They bought

1288
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:43,740
Speaker 1:  a streaming service, a pile of executives who no longer work there.

1289
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:48,270
Speaker 1:  They completely retooled the streaming service. And they've got this

1290
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:51,720
Speaker 1:  headphones company and it's still successful and throws off money that they

1291
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,620
Speaker 1:  treat like

1292
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:58,680
Speaker 1:  they do not care about beats at all. It is so funny to me,

1293
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,720
Speaker 1:  but good on apple in this roundabout way for making

1294
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,480
Speaker 1:  a product for Android people. It's the thing they rarely do. That was really

1295
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,110
Speaker 1:  nice of them.

1296
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:11,520
Speaker 2:  I wonder why not both though. Why is it? Does it just then become too much

1297
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,390
Speaker 2:  of an AirPods pro killer? Like it's too close in AirPods pro feature set.

1298
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,270
Speaker 2:  And so they needed to hold something back. I dunno. When

1299
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:21,570
Speaker 1:  One company controls the entire market, then we weird synthetic decisions

1300
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:25,380
Speaker 1:  about that. Like, I don't know, man, like it

1301
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:29,220
Speaker 1:  just wacky. Okay. So that's one. You can either be a Krista did

1302
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:33,210
Speaker 1:  like them. They seem great. And then lastly, you can sign up.

1303
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,870
Speaker 1:  There's a webpage to sign up for dish networks, forthcoming

1304
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:40,730
Speaker 1:  5g wireless service. So you will recall when T-Mobile

1305
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:44,760
Speaker 1:  sprint, the Trump administration engineered this complicated

1306
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:48,660
Speaker 1:  deal because they knew taking the market from four national

1307
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:52,530
Speaker 1:  wireless carriers to three was bad. Every ounce of evidence in the

1308
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:56,490
Speaker 1:  world says, this is bad for consumers. Once again, competition the real

1309
01:16:56,490 --> 01:17:00,060
Speaker 1:  theme of the rush chest. So they were like, we have to still get a fourth

1310
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:03,840
Speaker 1:  one. We can't rely on sprint to not suck. So we're going to let you buy

1311
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,680
Speaker 1:  sprint, but you got to help dish stand up a new

1312
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:11,600
Speaker 1:  fourth carrier, which no one has ever believed will

1313
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,530
Speaker 1:  happen. But today we got a webpage. Hell

1314
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:19,070
Speaker 1:  yeah. That's all you can do. You can just put your email address on a webpage.

1315
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,990
Speaker 1:  The network is called project Genesis and the

1316
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:26,650
Speaker 1:  first S is a five. Yeah.

1317
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,930
Speaker 2:  It's just a very good the website, by the way,

1318
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:37,840
Speaker 2:  you have to, it's like a concert and a whole bunch of people are holding

1319
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,470
Speaker 2:  their fists and hands in the air. And the tagline is help us

1320
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:45,130
Speaker 2:  democratize wireless access and create the 5g network of the future,

1321
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:48,280
Speaker 2:  which is what you're going to do by giving them your email address.

1322
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,680
Speaker 1:  Very good. Like what does that mean? What does

1323
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:57,040
Speaker 1:  democratize wireless access mean? I don't know.

1324
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:02,260
Speaker 1:  I just think it's, it's very good. And also hilarious

1325
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,860
Speaker 1:  because when we inevitably moved to 6g networks,

1326
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,290
Speaker 1:  none of this will be valid anymore.

1327
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:12,490
Speaker 7:  Jenna six Jenna's six. That's so good. Oh

1328
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:15,970
Speaker 1:  My God. It's so good. Okay. So here's my theory.

1329
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:20,320
Speaker 1:  My theory. So we're like, you know, the Virgin is turning 10 this year

1330
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:24,880
Speaker 1:  and we're like talking a lot about rethinking and redesigning all this up.

1331
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:28,420
Speaker 1:  And like a thing that constantly happens to me is our design team. As like

1332
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:31,990
Speaker 1:  the one they like, and they make sure to show me a bunch of stuff. They don't

1333
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:34,780
Speaker 1:  like apple executive. Did you see this Steve jobs all the time?

1334
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:38,440
Speaker 1:  Like steer him towards the one they wanted by making the other ones really

1335
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:42,280
Speaker 1:  bad. My theory with this is the branding consultancy had one they

1336
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:45,940
Speaker 1:  really liked and they put a Shen five SIS,

1337
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:50,470
Speaker 1:  right. Is like the bad one to knock out, to make it seem like they'd

1338
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:54,550
Speaker 1:  explored a lot of things. And then dish network. I was like, Ooh, 5g

1339
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:58,330
Speaker 1:  and had to pivot and take it seriously, which is why this website is

1340
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:00,790
Speaker 1:  just, just to field for an email address.

1341
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,900
Speaker 7:  Dish also do like the hopper and it was just like a

1342
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:05,620
Speaker 7:  kangaroo.

1343
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:08,920
Speaker 1:  It was a hopper and the Joey, somebody

1344
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,320
Speaker 7:  There is just like, you know what, it's Charlie

1345
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,090
Speaker 1:  Irrigate. He's just a whimsical man.

1346
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:18,400
Speaker 1:  When I think of ruthless satellite CEO, Charlie Ergen, I'm like

1347
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:22,480
Speaker 1:  Wednesday guy likes kangaroos, kangaroos, and fives. You know that

1348
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:26,680
Speaker 1:  the underlying hopper story, do you remember this scene

1349
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:29,230
Speaker 1:  that gave hopper the CES best of show,

1350
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:34,060
Speaker 1:  but CNN is owned by CBS and

1351
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:37,990
Speaker 1:  CBS was suing dish network over the hopper. And so

1352
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:41,410
Speaker 1:  CBS made CNET team take away the award

1353
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,770
Speaker 1:  over time, shifting on the hopper. And like, I don't think

1354
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:48,400
Speaker 1:  <inaudible> still mad about that. Yeah.

1355
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,420
Speaker 1:  But look, I hope project Jen, Jenna six goes, well,

1356
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:56,260
Speaker 1:  it's going to be so good. We'll see. I, we, we were talking and I was like,

1357
01:19:56,260 --> 01:20:00,220
Speaker 1:  we cannot over cover the launch of a ground up wireless network in the

1358
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,790
Speaker 1:  United States. Like it's a big deal. But the idea that it's actually going

1359
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:07,620
Speaker 1:  to happen is also going to like ship people, their own towers. Now they've

1360
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:11,520
Speaker 1:  got this. It's like we were, they thought we were going to wrap up.

1361
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,430
Speaker 1:  No you did. You got 15 minutes on cotton baby.

1362
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:23,060
Speaker 1:  This idea right now, cell networks run on proprietary software

1363
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,970
Speaker 1:  stacks called radio access networks. There's a handful of suppliers. The

1364
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:29,690
Speaker 1:  biggest one, which is Walway the reason they're like democratize it. American

1365
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:33,320
Speaker 1:  5g, all this marketing is they're trying to build something called <inaudible>

1366
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:36,890
Speaker 1:  open radio access networks that are interoperable. There are no suppliers

1367
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:40,820
Speaker 1:  for this. The pliers they have chosen are still based in

1368
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:43,280
Speaker 1:  Asia in various ways. Like they haven't actually accomplished their goal,

1369
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,950
Speaker 1:  but they think that like Erickson, all these companies can build new kinds

1370
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:49,340
Speaker 1:  of radio hardware for them they'll they operate cheaper. And then they just

1371
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:52,460
Speaker 1:  keep saying, AWS will be involved in some mysterious way that they've failed

1372
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:56,390
Speaker 1:  to explain. So like there's a lot going on with this

1373
01:20:56,390 --> 01:21:00,290
Speaker 1:  dish network, wireless idea, a lot of buzz words, just a lot of

1374
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:00,770
Speaker 1:  words.

1375
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:03,410
Speaker 7:  I love it. Yeah. Not even buzzwords. Just words.

1376
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,990
Speaker 1:  Just throwing words at us in the hopes were distracted, but they're like

1377
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:12,440
Speaker 1:  Amazon. And then like the regulators, like there's a fourth wireless network

1378
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,410
Speaker 1:  and it's like, no, actually what's going to happen is T-Mobile's going to

1379
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:19,310
Speaker 1:  turn off it's 3g network and a bunch of dish mobile customers are not

1380
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:23,180
Speaker 1:  going to have surface. All right. That was it. That

1381
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:26,660
Speaker 1:  was Vergecast. Thank you to Alex.

1382
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:30,890
Speaker 1:  She pretended to care about Iran today. McKenna

1383
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:34,790
Speaker 1:  and Tom, thank you both very much. That was great. We will be back

1384
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,450
Speaker 1:  next week. There's a windows event. So lots going on next week.

1385
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:41,690
Speaker 1:  Also, as McKenna said, markup on these entrust bells. I know there's a lot

1386
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:45,020
Speaker 1:  of news decoder this past week,

1387
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:49,060
Speaker 1:  Jamie Hyman CTO, John Deere. I would say the response to the

1388
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:52,970
Speaker 1:  John Deere episode of decoder is unlike anything that I ever expected. People

1389
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:56,540
Speaker 1:  really care about trackers. It turns out next week, Jack

1390
01:21:56,540 --> 01:22:00,230
Speaker 1:  Conti CEO of Patrion. That was like a deep

1391
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:04,580
Speaker 1:  creator economy conversation. So that's coming up. You can tweet at us. I'm

1392
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:08,570
Speaker 1:  at reckless. Dieter's at Baclofen. Tom is at Tom Warren.

1393
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:12,920
Speaker 1:  McKenna is at Kelly McKenna. I name the backwards. Alex is

1394
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:16,850
Speaker 1:  Alex H yeah, that was incredible. That's it? Rock and roll.

1395
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:17,810
Speaker 1:  Snip. Snip.
