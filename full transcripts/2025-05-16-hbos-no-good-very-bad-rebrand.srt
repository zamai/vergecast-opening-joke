Description: Names are hard — but they don't have to be this hard. Nilay, David, and The Verge's Jake Kastrenakes start the show with some personal news, before digging into the monumentally silly thinking behind Warner Bros. Discovery re-re-naming its streaming service HBO Max. After that, and some more streaming news, we turn our attention to the gadget news of the week, including the long-awaited release of CarPlay Ultra and the latest announcements from the Android team at Google. Finally, in the lightning round, it's time for Brendan Carr is a Dummy, some debate on the future of Airbnb, and a brief party speaker update. Because the mystery continues.

00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:44,495
Speaker 5:  Hello and welcome to Cast the Flagship podcast. The pretending that everyone

3
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:48,495
Speaker 5:  has Aston Martins, you know, just all everybody who

4
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:48,695
Speaker 5:  does it.

5
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:53,015
Speaker 6:  One of the great flexes of all time is being able to say our product has

6
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:55,215
Speaker 6:  begun rolling out in one car. No one will ever buy.

7
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:57,935
Speaker 5:  Well, no, it's all newer. Aston Martins David.

8
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,735
Speaker 6:  Yeah. One car no one will ever buy. So

9
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:04,615
Speaker 7:  I have to buy a new Aston Martin for this. I can't get this on my

10
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:05,095
Speaker 7:  existing,

11
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:09,055
Speaker 5:  We're gonna get to it. But yes, it is new

12
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:13,055
Speaker 5:  Aston Martins as of today. And then if you, you

13
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:16,975
Speaker 5:  have a newer Aston Martin that has the next generation Aston

14
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:20,775
Speaker 5:  Martin infotainment system, you can go to your dealer and

15
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:24,575
Speaker 5:  get a software update because God knows Aston Martin owners

16
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:27,335
Speaker 5:  cannot insert a USB drive into their own car.

17
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:31,495
Speaker 6:  Okay, I have a question. There is one Aston Martin

18
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:35,355
Speaker 6:  in my neighborhood. Is it journalistically

19
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:39,195
Speaker 6:  problematic? If next time I see them, I track them to their house and

20
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:43,115
Speaker 6:  ask them questions in their driveway about their Aston Martin? There's

21
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:46,395
Speaker 6:  only one. Like I, I know I, I could recite the license plate, but I will

22
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:50,195
Speaker 6:  not, but it's like, it's an Aston Martin, like I see it a lot and

23
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:52,835
Speaker 6:  it's like, oh, that's the Aston Martin. And I have always wondered where

24
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:55,515
Speaker 6:  they live. Do I now have a good journalistic reason to find out,

25
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:57,675
Speaker 7:  Go slow, start with cookies,

26
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:02,485
Speaker 6:  You know, okay. At at just like ask about the neighborhood and

27
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:04,805
Speaker 6:  then a couple weeks later be like, I need to go for a drive.

28
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:06,865
Speaker 6:  I, I like this

29
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:10,785
Speaker 5:  As a, as a car person. This is, this breaks in two ways.

30
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:15,855
Speaker 5:  One, this guy has been dreaming of the day

31
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:18,855
Speaker 5:  someone shows up and is like, I see you have an Aston Martin.

32
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,935
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There's no reason to buy one otherwise, right?

33
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:25,055
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like I, I drive the, the Mustang around and like the high school

34
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,175
Speaker 5:  kids are like, wherever the engine, I'm like, well this is why I bought this

35
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:30,975
Speaker 5:  car. Like, it's great. That's exactly what you want. And then

36
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:33,895
Speaker 5:  there's the car people who were like, I'm not here.

37
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,315
Speaker 5:  I was in Florida a couple years ago right when the Lucid Air came out and

38
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:42,035
Speaker 5:  this was like, we're on vacation in like a, my friend's ritzy part of Florida

39
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:46,835
Speaker 5:  and I saw his neighbor had a lucid air. And so we were walking up and I deployed

40
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:51,035
Speaker 5:  Max who was, you know, at the time, a toddler. So like extra cute. And

41
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:54,955
Speaker 5:  I, I tod her over to the Lucid Air and I was like, my

42
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,915
Speaker 5:  kid likes your car, what is it? And he is like, I don't know what you're

43
00:03:56,915 --> 00:04:00,675
Speaker 5:  talking about. And you just don't, you just walk away. You just, you don't

44
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:04,235
Speaker 5:  wanna Right. That's a, that's a person with security. Yeah, he did not. I

45
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:06,275
Speaker 5:  was like, no, not a lot of people have these. How'd you get it? He is like,

46
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:06,635
Speaker 5:  I don dunno.

47
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:09,825
Speaker 6:  He's like, what? What are you talking about? I don't have a car. What's a

48
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:10,465
Speaker 6:  car? Who

49
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:12,985
Speaker 5:  Are you? Yeah, now it's like Lucid would like everyone to talk about Lucid

50
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:16,105
Speaker 5:  Arrow a little bit more than they have been. But that and that, there's only

51
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:16,745
Speaker 5:  two ways this goes.

52
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:18,425
Speaker 6:  Right, okay.

53
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:22,385
Speaker 5:  I either, I mean, and it's an Aston, I think I know which way, like no one's

54
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:23,985
Speaker 5:  secretive about their Aston Martin. No.

55
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,145
Speaker 6:  If you're secretive about an Aston, you don't, you have too much money.

56
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:30,025
Speaker 6:  I don't, I don't like it.

57
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,465
Speaker 5:  But there's not like it Yeah, it, it's not like a hard, you don't have to

58
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,345
Speaker 5:  get like an allocation to go a new asset Martin.

59
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,065
Speaker 6:  True.

60
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:40,205
Speaker 5:  Like there's like Ferrari that you can only buy if you've bought enough previous

61
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:44,105
Speaker 5:  Ferraris. This is why all the crypto bros have Lambos, by the way, this is

62
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:47,825
Speaker 5:  a real thing. Lambos are so, like, new money is

63
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:49,945
Speaker 5:  associated with Lamborghini. 'cause Lamborghini will just sell you a car.

64
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:54,485
Speaker 5:  You are like, oh my God, I did it. Meme coin, what do I do? Buy

65
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:57,045
Speaker 5:  Lambo. And the reason is, 'cause you can just show up at the Lamborghini

66
00:04:57,045 --> 00:05:00,445
Speaker 5:  dealer and they will just be like, yeah, you give us money and here's this

67
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:03,605
Speaker 5:  car. You show up at the Ferrari dealership and like, have you bought our

68
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:07,525
Speaker 5:  shit Ferrari's for the past 10 years and kept them and not recently. Now

69
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:11,445
Speaker 5:  you may have our best Ferrari. And those guys do not talk about

70
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,085
Speaker 5:  where they're at. They're, they're also often,

71
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,325
Speaker 5:  you know, the rulers of Middle Eastern nations. So they, they often don't

72
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:20,085
Speaker 5:  talk about it again. Of course. Anyhow, we're gonna talk about Next Generation

76
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:29,925
Speaker 5:  We have to start though

77
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:34,965
Speaker 5:  with news about ourselves. This is a real thing. We're gonna start with news

Speaker 5:  we're we're, we're gonna go away. We're gonna, we're gonna try to take leave.

95
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:37,395
Speaker 5:  Fox meeting has actually really, really great parental leave. I didn't, it

96
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:41,355
Speaker 5:  didn't when I had my first baby and I, I only took

97
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:45,195
Speaker 5:  like eight weeks and now we have like a like really great like industry leading

98
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:48,075
Speaker 5:  leave. We're gonna try to take it and like model it for our team. Like the

99
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,835
Speaker 5:  whole thing that we do. I suspect I will fail in, in some ways

100
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:55,075
Speaker 5:  to, to take the whole thing. Yeah. Just given the nature of the job.

101
00:06:56,135 --> 00:07:00,075
Speaker 5:  But I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try. And in the meantime on this show, Jake

102
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:01,355
Speaker 5:  is gonna take over hosting.

103
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:05,315
Speaker 7:  It's gonna be fun. Yeah. First off, congratulations to both of you. Thank

104
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:08,755
Speaker 7:  you. It was very exciting. They said this off camera, but they're both gonna

105
00:07:08,755 --> 00:07:11,915
Speaker 7:  do live stream gender reveal parties. I think. I think it's probably gonna

106
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:13,635
Speaker 7:  be on Twitch. Stay tuned. That's

107
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:15,195
Speaker 6:  Fun. I like that idea. Yeah,

108
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,075
Speaker 7:  It's, it is definitely, definitely what we wanna do.

109
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:20,475
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna do mine in the woods and we're gonna fire a cannon of some kind.

110
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:21,715
Speaker 6:  Do you think that's a bad idea?

111
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:24,955
Speaker 5:  Our doctor in their office, in the waiting room, there's a sign, you know,

112
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:27,995
Speaker 5:  when there's a, there's a sign, you know, this has been a problem, like in

113
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:31,675
Speaker 5:  a corporate environment, the sign says we will not tell anyone the

114
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:34,915
Speaker 5:  gender of your baby. And it says like literally down the line. Oh my God.

115
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:37,675
Speaker 5:  It's like, we will not call the bakery. We will not call your grandparents.

116
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:40,795
Speaker 5:  Oh wow. And it's like a long list and it's like every one of those is something

117
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,955
Speaker 5:  that has happened. And we will not call the bakery as the first one.

118
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:47,515
Speaker 6:  There have been like siblings and cousins who are calling being like, tell

119
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:49,835
Speaker 6:  me So I can go do the gender reveal party. We

120
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:53,155
Speaker 5:  Were just like, tell us. We wanna know. But I, what appears to be happening

121
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:56,995
Speaker 5:  is people go in for the whatever, one reveals the sex of the

122
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:00,835
Speaker 5:  baby and then they don't want to know. And they ask

123
00:08:00,835 --> 00:08:04,765
Speaker 5:  the doctor, will you call our bakery so we can get the cake

124
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:08,045
Speaker 5:  that reveals the gender? I get it. And they're like, we are not part of this.

125
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,135
Speaker 5:  If you would like a cake to be involved in this situation, the baker can

126
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:12,535
Speaker 5:  come with you.

127
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:16,655
Speaker 7:  See, I thought there was a, a hipaa carve out for bakers.

128
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:21,495
Speaker 5:  It's very good that like every one of those on the side is like, oh, this

129
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:23,895
Speaker 5:  has happened like down to like firework story. And it's like, we're just

130
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:25,255
Speaker 5:  like not doing it. You realize

131
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,935
Speaker 6:  You just described like an Uber Eats feature waiting to happen, right? Like

132
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:33,135
Speaker 6:  it's, someone will come with you, find out the sex of your baby

133
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:36,615
Speaker 6:  and then go acquire all the necessary things for your gender reveal party.

134
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:37,375
Speaker 5:  It's very

135
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,175
Speaker 6:  Good. It's like it's sitting there.

136
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:42,505
Speaker 5:  It is, it is truly good. But yeah, it's, we're we're going and, and,

142
00:08:57,525 --> 00:09:00,565
Speaker 6:  the rich people. And the instruction that Nila and I have been giving to

143
00:09:00,565 --> 00:09:04,325
Speaker 6:  everybody is just get real weird with it. So I,

144
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,765
Speaker 6:  we take no responsibility for what happens over the summer, but also I think

145
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,845
Speaker 6:  it's gonna be very fun and I'm, I'm excited to actually get to like, listen

146
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:13,125
Speaker 6:  to the show and not hear my own stupid voice.

147
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:17,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's gonna be a good time. I'll still be here. We're gonna bring,

148
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:20,765
Speaker 7:  bring people in from all across The Verge. So lots of faces that you

149
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:23,765
Speaker 7:  already know and are familiar with. Hopefully we'll get some more time for

150
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:26,405
Speaker 7:  folks who get on here a little less often. We're gonna have a good time.

151
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:26,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

152
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:30,685
Speaker 5:  And then out in decoder what we're gonna do is, Alex Heath is gonna host

153
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:33,845
Speaker 5:  the Thursday episode. So we'll explain our episodes. Here's what's going

154
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:37,245
Speaker 5:  on. And on Monday, the, the CEO interviews, we have a bunch of really cool

155
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:40,445
Speaker 5:  guest hosts. I'm very excited to announce some of these names as they come

156
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:43,245
Speaker 5:  up. That's gonna be really fun. I've told those folks,

157
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:47,605
Speaker 5:  don't try to make decoder interviews. Just go talk to people you think are

158
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,405
Speaker 5:  really interesting and like have a good time. And I think once you hear who

159
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:55,165
Speaker 5:  the guest host are, you will be equally excited about the idea of those people

160
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,845
Speaker 5:  just like playing in the sandbox. So that's the plan.

161
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:01,615
Speaker 5:  It's, it's, it is just gonna be a mess. Yeah. I think everyone will be happy

162
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:04,455
Speaker 5:  that I'm not around. Just be perfectly honest. It'll be everyone will finally

163
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:08,295
Speaker 5:  breathe. The tech industry will take a break. Brendan cars,

164
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,015
Speaker 5:  honestly, I'm just gonna call in once a week in and rail up Brendan, if you

165
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:16,735
Speaker 5:  thought that you would get one ounce of relief. I don't know how I turn an

166
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:19,095
Speaker 5:  announcement into us having babies and the threat about Brendan Barr, but

167
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:19,255
Speaker 5:  I did

168
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:22,895
Speaker 6:  It. Brendan Carr is a dummy is has always been just for Eli. So it, it stands

169
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:24,495
Speaker 6:  to reason that you'll keep making it even when

170
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:28,695
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna hold my new child to the light like Simba and be like, your

171
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:32,575
Speaker 5:  job is to torment this man. It's gonna be great. I'm really excited

172
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,335
Speaker 5:  about it. We have done a basically bad job of keeping the secret for

173
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:36,615
Speaker 5:  months.

174
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:41,055
Speaker 5:  So I'm glad we can finally tell all of you. But it's happening. We're weeks

175
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:44,575
Speaker 5:  away. And then David and I have to figure out how to be parents of infants

176
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:48,135
Speaker 5:  again, which will be a delight. Yeah. I will say baby monitor

177
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:51,855
Speaker 5:  technology has progressed exactly zero in the past seven years.

178
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:55,175
Speaker 7:  Quick question. Who is reviewing the snoo?

179
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,295
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be, it's, So I threatened to review this SNOO when Max was

180
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:04,095
Speaker 5:  born and Dr. Harvey Karp, the inventor of the Sno and I

181
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:05,975
Speaker 5:  had many, many, many conversations

182
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:10,735
Speaker 5:  there. There's a lot going on with that product. He is very charming.

183
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:14,375
Speaker 5:  I think Kristen Raki, our creative director has written about the SNOO in

184
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,175
Speaker 5:  the meantime. Right. We, we've had a lot of babies on The Verge team recently

185
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:20,135
Speaker 5:  and there's a lot of SNOO opinions.

186
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:25,825
Speaker 5:  Sure. Max hated this. Snoo hated it. I was

187
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:28,905
Speaker 5:  gonna review it and we stuck her in it. There's a hilarious picture on my

188
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:32,665
Speaker 5:  Instagram where she's just in it like she's a little

189
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:35,225
Speaker 5:  baby and she's all swaddled up. 'cause you put him in a straight jacket to

190
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:39,045
Speaker 5:  put him in this snoo and she's just like, what the fuck is this?

191
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:43,405
Speaker 5:  Like, it's just like every exposed part of her body is communicating

192
00:11:43,405 --> 00:11:47,325
Speaker 5:  that message from her eyes down. She, so we never used it. She was just like,

193
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:51,245
Speaker 5:  I I hate you. I'm very upset with you. I don dunno. David, were you a

194
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:51,565
Speaker 5:  new person?

195
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:56,085
Speaker 6:  No, we, I spent an alarming amount of money on things

196
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:59,925
Speaker 6:  a baby might sleep in that ours decided not to sleep in. But we never got

197
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:03,405
Speaker 6:  all the way to the snoo in part because right before I left on leave,

198
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,105
Speaker 6:  you and I were in a car on in, in San

199
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:11,665
Speaker 6:  Francisco going somewhere and you spent like an hour in traffic

200
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:14,465
Speaker 6:  railing against the snoo. And I was just like, well, I guess I won't get

201
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:17,625
Speaker 6:  the snoo. So the SNOO is just not allowed After that.

202
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,985
Speaker 5:  Look, we have, we have some parents, j Peters on our team, like loves the

203
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:24,185
Speaker 5:  snoo. Like I I think they, his view of it is like they wouldn't have gotten

204
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:27,625
Speaker 5:  it through it without the snoo. Great. Like whatever, like the lesson you

205
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:31,265
Speaker 5:  learn when you have the first baby is no one knows anything at all. Correct.

206
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:34,065
Speaker 5:  The babies are very resilient and they will be fine and you just have to

207
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:36,945
Speaker 5:  get through it. Yep. And so like, whatever works, man, like I have no judgment,

208
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:40,785
Speaker 5:  but Max just hated this thing. And there's one

209
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:44,505
Speaker 5:  piece of information from my many conversations with Dr. Karp that just,

210
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:46,825
Speaker 5:  it just, it just undid it for me.

211
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:52,065
Speaker 5:  So the, the snoo you know, like rocks the baby, it like, it detects when

212
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:55,625
Speaker 5:  the baby wakes up and it starts rocking and then he,

213
00:12:56,405 --> 00:12:59,785
Speaker 5:  you know, there's this, it makes noise. It makes like white noise. And he,

214
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,865
Speaker 5:  in his books, if you read Happiest Baby, which is his book or whatever, he's

215
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,225
Speaker 5:  like, we tried to make the sounds of

216
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:10,425
Speaker 5:  like mothers around the world. They all instinctively make this sh sound.

217
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:14,385
Speaker 5:  And in the book, and even when you talk to him, he always comes back to the

218
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:17,345
Speaker 5:  like the sound Indian mothers make, which is, and he's, he's like, and they

219
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:20,745
Speaker 5:  go Shoo Cho. And like he's like, and then he's got this idea that all these

220
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:23,465
Speaker 5:  cultures make this sound. So what you gotta do is like, pet the baby really

221
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:27,445
Speaker 5:  hard and goes sh And I'm like, dude, if you go up to an

222
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,925
Speaker 5:  like my mom and you're like, did you ever just say Jupe to me really loud?

223
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:33,805
Speaker 5:  She'd be like, no, because that means shut up.

224
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,165
Speaker 5:  Like that's what my mom would say when she was angry at me later in life

225
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:42,125
Speaker 5:  to shut up. And I was like, this is just a weird, there's a gap here.

226
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:45,165
Speaker 5:  I don't understand. And then later I was actually talking to him and I was

227
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:48,165
Speaker 5:  like, where these sounds like you have this big idea about these sounds and

228
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:51,885
Speaker 5:  this like cultural connection to the sound. Like how did you make

229
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:55,405
Speaker 5:  the sound that the steam makes? And I was just never forget it. He was like,

230
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:57,845
Speaker 5:  oh yeah, my like nephew and I sat around like made a garage band.

231
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:00,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I was like, all right dude. It always comes back to garage band.

232
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:01,205
Speaker 6:  Like,

233
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:05,125
Speaker 5:  Alright man. So I will say Dr. Karp is lovely. I

234
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,325
Speaker 5:  believe him. He's very sincere. He has all these ideas of what this new is

235
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:11,165
Speaker 5:  and what it should be and different ways for it to go to different people.

236
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,845
Speaker 5:  They, they got in trouble recently for pricing. I think Jay actually wrote

237
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:17,405
Speaker 5:  that story for us. Many many parents love this product. It was just, I,

238
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:20,085
Speaker 5:  my daughter and I were both like, I don't know man.

239
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:26,245
Speaker 5:  Anyway, we're gonna have more babies. We we while further Snu coverage is

240
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:30,215
Speaker 5:  coming. That's it Everybody. That's The Vergecast. There's

241
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:31,135
Speaker 5:  some destabilizing

242
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,255
Speaker 6:  Yeah. To big Good. And to be clear, we're not going anywhere for a while

243
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:37,935
Speaker 6:  here. So we got, we got time. We have, we do have time. Many things left

244
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:38,815
Speaker 6:  to talk about before

245
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:41,735
Speaker 5:  We get got lots of developer conferences coming up. There's lots of news.

246
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:45,015
Speaker 5:  Yes. And then we're gonna take a break for the summer. Yeah. Come back. Alright.

247
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:48,255
Speaker 5:  Let's talk about speaking of things named Max

248
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:55,685
Speaker 6:  Neli. This is the, this should be the greatest day in in

249
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:59,645
Speaker 6:  recent history in your household. Just the, our long

250
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:04,365
Speaker 6:  national nightmare of max streaming services is

251
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:05,765
Speaker 5:  Finally over. No, they didn't get rid of the word max.

252
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:07,165
Speaker 6:  That's fair.

253
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:13,825
Speaker 6:  Now it's a, now it's a qualifier. That's true. It's, it's an

254
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,225
Speaker 6:  adjective now. It's, and not, not the noun.

255
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:20,425
Speaker 5:  So the news is that Warner Bros Discovery had its upfronts this week. All

256
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:23,025
Speaker 5:  the streamers had their upfronts, that's where they present to advertisers.

257
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:25,865
Speaker 5:  All the new kinds of things they can buy the new content that will be out

258
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:29,385
Speaker 5:  on the services. And as part of the WBD

259
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:33,345
Speaker 5:  upfronts, they announced that the streaming service Max would now be

260
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,905
Speaker 5:  called HBO Max, which is what it was called to begin with.

261
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:41,465
Speaker 5:  And they changed it 50 times along the way. Landing on

262
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:45,345
Speaker 5:  Max Big campaign. They shoved it full of weird

263
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,905
Speaker 5:  discovery reality shows when we talk about all that history. And then they

264
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:51,945
Speaker 5:  realized that no one cared about that. What they wanted was HBO shows. So

265
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:55,425
Speaker 5:  they're taking the weird discovery reality shows out and renaming the whole

266
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:58,505
Speaker 5:  thing. HBO Max, which again is what it was called

267
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:03,325
Speaker 6:  And what everybody continued to call it. Like they just could not break that.

268
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:07,565
Speaker 5:  It's funny how much the at t Tom Warner deal is going to come up in this

269
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:11,365
Speaker 5:  episode. It's gonna come up a lot at

270
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:15,405
Speaker 5:  t Bought Time Warner, the only thing that that resulted in was

271
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:19,935
Speaker 5:  the grayscale four three Snyder cut that, that's what happened.

272
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:23,815
Speaker 5:  They bought at t bought Time Warner and then Zach Snyder was like, these

273
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:27,815
Speaker 5:  dorks have money and berated them with an online harassment campaign into

274
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:31,775
Speaker 5:  completing the Snyder cut the, the pinnacle of which was a gray

275
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:35,105
Speaker 5:  scale four three Snyder cut, which you can go watch right now. It's how Justice

276
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:39,105
Speaker 5:  is Gray. It continues to exist on the ServiceNow HBO Max. But

277
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:42,865
Speaker 5:  that in terms of concrete results of at and t

278
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:46,605
Speaker 5:  buying Time Warner, that is it. As near as I can tell,

279
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:49,645
Speaker 5:  oh many oh, thousands of jobs were lost. Oh, just a little side note.

280
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:50,565
Speaker 6:  Minor detail. Yeah.

281
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:54,485
Speaker 5:  Many, many, many thousands of layoffs. But you got a four three gray scale

282
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:58,245
Speaker 5:  Snyder cut. It's in four three 'cause he, he wanted it to be an imax,

283
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:03,025
Speaker 5:  but no one has an IMAX screen in their house. So he is like tall. So

284
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:06,425
Speaker 5:  we're gonna go with four three, that literally his explanation four, three,

285
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:11,495
Speaker 5:  whatever. That's the, the only result of at t buying Tap Warner that you

286
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:14,735
Speaker 5:  can still see to this day or that resulted really in anything at all.

287
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:18,975
Speaker 5:  This turned out to be a bad idea because it turns out you can't build your

288
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:21,295
Speaker 5:  entire business on one movie.

289
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:26,455
Speaker 5:  It's really the only thing that happened. So they at and t sells Time Warner

290
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:30,295
Speaker 5:  to Warner Bros. Discovery to Discovery. David Zoff.

291
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:34,095
Speaker 5:  He's like, well you got this asset called HBO Max. That's the thing. That's

292
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:37,415
Speaker 5:  the streaming service that's already out. I'm gonna turn it into a competitor

293
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:41,295
Speaker 5:  Netflix by dumping all my stuff on it. Right. And then he renames it

294
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:41,975
Speaker 5:  Max. Yeah.

295
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:45,815
Speaker 6:  He smooshed Discovery Plus and HBO Max

296
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:47,495
Speaker 6:  together and called it Max essentially.

297
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:51,325
Speaker 5:  Yep. And also on this literally the same day he killed the

298
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:55,125
Speaker 5:  CNN plus streaming service that at t Time Warner had launched

299
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:58,725
Speaker 5:  just before selling their, their entire company to Discovery.

300
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:04,025
Speaker 5:  As of today, both of those big decisions have been completely rolled back.

301
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:04,345
Speaker 5:  Yep.

302
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:06,465
Speaker 6:  CNN Plus coming back. Yeah.

303
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:09,865
Speaker 5:  CNN Plus is coming back as a standalone streaming service. HBO Max

304
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:14,145
Speaker 5:  is now HBO Max again. And the discovery content has been pulled out of it.

305
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:17,905
Speaker 5:  Literally, oh, by the way, thousands of people have been laid off along the

306
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:21,745
Speaker 5:  way. Yep. Like, none of this has worked. And mostly people have

307
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:25,065
Speaker 5:  lost their jobs and now they're, you know, they're doing this acute marketing

308
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:27,945
Speaker 5:  campaign where they're like, we know we, we screwed. It's like, no, you really

309
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:28,465
Speaker 5:  screwed up.

310
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:32,625
Speaker 6:  This is such an unbelievable disaster that I like

311
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:36,945
Speaker 6:  I I you cannot put too fine a point on how stupid this company has been

312
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:40,505
Speaker 6:  throughout every single bit of this process. And, and they are, they're trying

313
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:44,305
Speaker 6:  to play it off like a joke they did in the press release announcing

314
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:48,105
Speaker 6:  this. They included the, the Ross and Rachel. We were on a break

315
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:51,865
Speaker 6:  thing, which like a cool timely cultural reference guys,

316
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:54,145
Speaker 6:  everybody knows what friends is now.

317
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:58,745
Speaker 6:  And then they did a thing where there was like the, the white smoke coming

318
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:00,985
Speaker 6:  out and they were like, we've picked a new brand. And it's like, no, no,

319
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:03,425
Speaker 6:  no. What happened? It's your idiots.

320
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:04,865
Speaker 5:  Like, and

321
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:08,665
Speaker 6:  You were over and over and the very, very thing that everybody said

322
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:11,625
Speaker 6:  the first day you announced this, which is that this is monumentally stupid

323
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,105
Speaker 6:  because you are taking the best brand in entertainment and just

324
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:18,785
Speaker 6:  deleting it from existence in the name of every

325
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:23,345
Speaker 6:  nonsensical thing that you wanna put on this platform. They're just unwinding

326
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:27,145
Speaker 6:  it completely. And then now again, there, there are lots of rumors

327
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,705
Speaker 6:  and some really good reporting out there that suggest that this company is

328
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:33,265
Speaker 6:  about to split up again. Like truly we are just going to have

329
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:37,145
Speaker 6:  accomplished nothing except burning a ton of money and losing many,

330
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:40,225
Speaker 6:  many jobs. Bad thing over and over and over again. They're

331
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,745
Speaker 5:  Really good at that thing. They're

332
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:42,545
Speaker 6:  Really good at that thing.

333
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:45,985
Speaker 5:  They're really good at cost cutting. We rail against mergers on the show

334
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,625
Speaker 5:  constantly. The thing with mergers, in particular mergers with Time Warner

335
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:53,225
Speaker 5:  is that all they do is delete jobs and make everyone look stupid. Yeah. Like

336
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,465
Speaker 5:  if you're out there being like, I could do a better job with this. I should

337
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:59,185
Speaker 5:  buy Time Warner. I I urge you to walk into the ocean and never look back

338
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:02,945
Speaker 5:  because that will be a more successful outcome for you than buying Time

339
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:05,905
Speaker 5:  Warner. It is the kiss of death. A OL Time Warner was a company

340
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:10,675
Speaker 5:  I used to work at it and, and GA was part of a OL Time Warner. And it

341
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:14,035
Speaker 5:  destroyed that company. It, it broke it in half care. Switcher wrote two

342
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:17,515
Speaker 5:  books about it. One of them has great greatest hell of any business book

343
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:21,315
Speaker 5:  ever. There must be a Pony in here somewhere. It's a quote from

344
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:25,315
Speaker 5:  I believe a Time Warner exec who said, this is a giant pile of shit in our

345
00:20:25,315 --> 00:20:27,675
Speaker 5:  entire thesis. Is there has to be a pony in here somewhere.

346
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:29,075
Speaker 6:  My God. That's

347
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:29,755
Speaker 5:  Amazing. Incredible.

348
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:32,925
Speaker 6:  That is a really good line.

349
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:35,605
Speaker 6:  That's really good.

350
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:39,005
Speaker 5:  Incredible. You should just go read it. It's just a bunch of egos who think

351
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,965
Speaker 5:  they can just like manufacture a thing out of nothing. And that has been

352
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:44,725
Speaker 5:  the story of Time Warner this whole time. I guess this time it's just Warner

353
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:48,525
Speaker 5:  Time Inc. The other part of Time Warner was sold to, to Mark Benioff, CEO

354
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:52,285
Speaker 5:  of Salesforce, who immediately invested in Humane and then had Time

355
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:56,405
Speaker 5:  Magazine named the Humane Pin. One of the best inventions of the year

356
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:59,645
Speaker 5:  doing great. Everybody. So that's going great over there. Yeah. But you just

357
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:03,445
Speaker 5:  see that the problem is you keep buying the media asset and then

358
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:07,365
Speaker 5:  treating it like a commodity and thinking that's gonna work. And

359
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:10,565
Speaker 5:  thinking in particular that you can make something that isn't

360
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:15,295
Speaker 5:  fancy, fancy, just 'cause you have the Warner Brothers Library.

361
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:19,615
Speaker 5:  And so, you know, with a OL it was, we're gonna make a OL fancy by having

362
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:23,015
Speaker 5:  this big media company and people will buy a OL because of it. Essentially

363
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,575
Speaker 5:  the same thesis for at t at t's thesis was we will

364
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,935
Speaker 5:  preload like bite-sized versions of Game of Thrones on mid-range Android

365
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:33,095
Speaker 5:  phones. And that's why people will choose us instead of Verizon.

366
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:37,365
Speaker 5:  I don't have to say anything else about that. And then

367
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:42,405
Speaker 5:  Discovery's thesis was, David Zav is a mid market

368
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:46,405
Speaker 5:  reality schlock stir and he is gonna become a titan of

369
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,925
Speaker 5:  Hollywood by having Warner Bros and doing all this stuff.

370
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:54,405
Speaker 5:  And he immediately was like, what if instead of caring about the new

371
00:21:54,405 --> 00:21:58,165
Speaker 5:  fancy thing I bought, I loaded it up with my mid-market schlock. And

372
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:01,535
Speaker 5:  you remember that slide from the beginning where they were like, here's the

373
00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:04,335
Speaker 5:  stuff we make for women and here's the stuff we make for men. Yeah. And we're

374
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:08,015
Speaker 5:  like, bring these icons together. And it was, it was just such a, a

375
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:11,495
Speaker 5:  two sway of thinking about anything like

376
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:15,735
Speaker 5:  content people, humanity. Like it's like, this is an

377
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:19,095
Speaker 5:  NBA fever dream that will result in nothing but layoffs. And and here we

378
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:19,695
Speaker 5:  are. Well

379
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:23,575
Speaker 6:  Even in the most generous reading of what

380
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:27,575
Speaker 6:  happened that came true and Netflix just absolutely kicked

381
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:31,375
Speaker 6:  its ass at it up and down. Like even if you wanna say there is

382
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,975
Speaker 6:  room for one sort of all encompassing general purpose

383
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:38,255
Speaker 6:  at all things to all people, every level of content

384
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:42,575
Speaker 6:  streamer, that's Netflix. It was obvious then that it was gonna be

385
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:46,495
Speaker 6:  Netflix. And it has become even more entrenched as Netflix since

386
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:50,415
Speaker 6:  then. Like the idea was truly to come out

387
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:54,375
Speaker 6:  and out. Netflix. Netflix and Boy have a lot of companies died attempting

388
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,495
Speaker 6:  to out Netflix. Netflix.

389
00:22:55,745 --> 00:22:59,535
Speaker 7:  Which is fascinating 'cause Netflix still has not figured out how

390
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:03,575
Speaker 7:  the like good movie part of making movies and Warner Brothers

391
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:06,975
Speaker 7:  like, as much as that's not going particularly well,

392
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:11,175
Speaker 7:  they at least still make movies people wanna watch. And Netflix has really

393
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:14,495
Speaker 7:  figured out how to do the like mid-tier totally average

394
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:18,175
Speaker 7:  reality show that they can just fill the library with.

395
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:22,245
Speaker 6:  Well, right. I ironically Netflix's whole thing,

396
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:24,805
Speaker 6:  like, do you remember years ago we were talking about like, can Netflix become

397
00:23:24,985 --> 00:23:27,605
Speaker 6:  HBO before HBO could becomes Netflix? And the answer was like, actually neither

398
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:31,685
Speaker 6:  one happened, but Netflix didn't need to become HBO. Yeah.

399
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:35,005
Speaker 6:  What it realized is that we're just going to release so many

400
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:39,525
Speaker 6:  mediocre Chris Hemsworth movies that we're gonna make up for it in volume

401
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:43,245
Speaker 6:  and we're gonna have a lot of C minus action movies and just

402
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:47,485
Speaker 6:  infinity reality shows. And that solves most of our problem. And that actually

403
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:51,245
Speaker 6:  making good movies is really hard, but making a lot of like eh, movies is

404
00:23:51,245 --> 00:23:54,765
Speaker 6:  pretty easy and all it costs is money. And so like Netflix has just

405
00:23:55,195 --> 00:23:58,685
Speaker 6:  decimated the competition in that particular game. Yes. And so now

406
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:02,805
Speaker 6:  reading through all the stuff that David Zaslav in particular is

407
00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:06,925
Speaker 6:  saying, it is the most like disingenuous

408
00:24:06,985 --> 00:24:10,765
Speaker 6:  way of being like, I was wrong and we got our ass kicked. And so

409
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:13,605
Speaker 6:  we're gonna go back to our old strategy, which is what if we just made good

410
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:16,365
Speaker 6:  things and if the good job is just to make good things, you know, it's the

411
00:24:16,365 --> 00:24:20,285
Speaker 6:  best brand ever for making good things. HBO like this is

412
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:23,085
Speaker 6:  what everybody said when they did it first. Like, why would you light on

413
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:26,405
Speaker 6:  fire the thing that most signifies quality entertainment?

414
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:28,765
Speaker 6:  And now they're like, what if we did quality entertainment?

415
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:32,565
Speaker 7:  I can't think of a single rebrand that's really like gone over well. So there's

416
00:24:32,565 --> 00:24:34,805
Speaker 7:  always, there's always the knee-jerk reaction, but there truly, I cannot

417
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:38,525
Speaker 7:  think of another rebrand where for like, from the

418
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:42,365
Speaker 7:  moment it happened for years afterward, like

419
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:46,525
Speaker 7:  up through, you know, leaders in the industry saying

420
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:50,245
Speaker 7:  it was a bad idea forever. And that is what has happened with the

421
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:54,245
Speaker 7:  Max rebrand, right? Like we get to Ted Sarandos like a month ago being like,

422
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:58,205
Speaker 7:  what were they thinking? Which like at that point it's like, I, I

423
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:02,005
Speaker 7:  don't know. Do you, do you stick with it out of pure shame or do you just

424
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:04,005
Speaker 7:  take the hint from the guy who's really successful?

425
00:25:04,715 --> 00:25:08,605
Speaker 5:  Well there's David, you've made the point many times that Netflix knows

426
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:12,325
Speaker 5:  its only real competition is YouTube. And once you have that

427
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:16,125
Speaker 5:  realization that you're competing for minutes in the day and the only real

428
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:19,525
Speaker 5:  competition for those minutes are video games and YouTube. Yep. You do two

429
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:22,365
Speaker 5:  things. One, you start making video games, which Netflix has started to do.

430
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:26,325
Speaker 5:  And two, you realize, oh, we're not here for fancy. Right.

431
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:30,205
Speaker 5:  The minutes in the day are being consumed by us on YouTube. Right, right.

432
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:33,925
Speaker 5:  Like we're we there's no CGI I here, wait and gentlemen, there

433
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:36,805
Speaker 5:  should be 'cause I think I should be dd, but we'll get to that.

434
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:42,015
Speaker 5:  But like, you know, YouTube content is fundamentally cheap. It's

435
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:45,895
Speaker 5:  vastly cheaper than the the stuff that HBO makes. And so Netflix has

436
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:49,215
Speaker 5:  just realized they can occupy a place on the middle of that cost curve

437
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:52,695
Speaker 5:  and have a huge amount of volume that's slightly better than YouTube. Yep.

438
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:56,575
Speaker 5:  And that's gonna be great. And I think what Z

439
00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:59,335
Speaker 5:  Love wanted to do was play that exact same game

440
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:04,255
Speaker 5:  with stuff that doesn't feel like YouTube at all. That feels like weird cable

441
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:08,295
Speaker 5:  reality programming that is like just kind of fine. Like, it,

442
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:10,975
Speaker 5:  it it, it's not even a thing. It's not even a thing that YouTube offers you,

443
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:14,815
Speaker 5:  which is at least it's mostly real people talking to you. Right,

444
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:18,535
Speaker 5:  right. It's, it's like this other thing that still has these like weird high

445
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,575
Speaker 5:  production costs. And so Netflix is starting to get into it. They're gonna

446
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:25,615
Speaker 5:  relaunch Star search. Right. They've got John Mullaney doing

447
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:29,495
Speaker 5:  a live talk show. Yeah. But that stuff feels different. It like, it

448
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:33,135
Speaker 5:  qualitatively feels different than old school cable

449
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,975
Speaker 5:  reality programming. It qualitatively feels different than YouTube. It occupies

450
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,295
Speaker 5:  a different space and they're winning on the time. And then you're like,

451
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,990
Speaker 5:  sure, here's whatever garbage Netflix movie of the month. It's just like

452
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,895
Speaker 5:  the next thing you can watch, I think HBO's game is like White

453
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:51,635
Speaker 5:  Lotus, right. Like appointment prestige

454
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:55,075
Speaker 5:  programming that costs a bunch of money. Yeah. I I I don't know if that will

455
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:57,155
Speaker 5:  be successful. I don't know if he's trying to sell it again. It does feel

456
00:26:57,155 --> 00:27:00,815
Speaker 5:  like he's trying to sell it again, but man, like

457
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:04,935
Speaker 5:  to just have missed it strategically so hard

458
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:08,065
Speaker 5:  because you could have built that stuff with HBO.

459
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:12,065
Speaker 6:  Right. And now they're saying this is the strategy, right?

460
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:16,065
Speaker 6:  Like they're just coming out and being like, oh, what we understand now is

461
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:19,785
Speaker 6:  that customers don't want just more stuff to watch. They

462
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:23,705
Speaker 6:  want the high quality stuff. And it's like, yeah,

463
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:27,585
Speaker 6:  that's, that's the HBO pitch. That's how HBO became this

464
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:31,385
Speaker 6:  like titanic least successful thing on

465
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:35,145
Speaker 6:  cable like that it worked. If you just have an

466
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:38,625
Speaker 6:  ongoing run of the busiest show on television,

467
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:42,785
Speaker 6:  which I think HBO has done more successfully probably than

468
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:45,305
Speaker 6:  every other network combined over the last several decades.

469
00:27:46,925 --> 00:27:50,825
Speaker 6:  You can win and it works. It's hard. It's very

470
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:53,705
Speaker 6:  hard and you cannot manufacture it out of nothing. But the fact that HBO

471
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:57,465
Speaker 6:  has like built the culture that keeps this stuff coming is very impressive.

472
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:01,745
Speaker 6:  And so to look at that and be like, oh, we're just gonna sort of cast

473
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:05,625
Speaker 6:  that off to the side then to only several years later turn around and

474
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:09,185
Speaker 6:  realize, oh, people like good shows is just so

475
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:13,465
Speaker 6:  backwards and insane to me. Like to just completely ignore every

476
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:17,265
Speaker 6:  actual asset you have and then turn around and be like, oh, we had these

477
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:20,985
Speaker 6:  assets, those are cool. It's like, what are you doing? Just drives me

478
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:21,265
Speaker 6:  insane.

479
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:25,105
Speaker 5:  The story of HBO is super fascinating and where it came from and this challenge

480
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:29,025
Speaker 5:  of constantly trying to re-up

481
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:32,765
Speaker 5:  the creative 'cause the show end, right? It's just like, it's over

482
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:36,725
Speaker 5:  now. Like we, the white Lotus has to exist because the

483
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:40,285
Speaker 5:  previous HBO because succession is over. Right. Right. Like that was, has

484
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:44,045
Speaker 5:  really always been the engine of HBO. We did a decoder episode with Felix

485
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:47,805
Speaker 5:  Gillette and John Colan who wrote a book called It's Not tv, the Spectacular

486
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:50,445
Speaker 5:  Rise Revolution of Future of HBO. It's a great book which just details it.

487
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:53,485
Speaker 5:  We'll link that episode, you should go read that book. But they've gotta

488
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:57,525
Speaker 5:  get back to that. Right. It's not clear what Engine makes

489
00:28:57,545 --> 00:29:00,965
Speaker 5:  the next white Lotus at HBO anymore. That's the problem.

490
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:05,525
Speaker 5:  And if they are trying to sell it, it's also not clear who would buy it

491
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:09,865
Speaker 5:  because that's just an expensive, risky proposition compared to here's a

492
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:13,345
Speaker 5:  bunch of cheap stuff, we hope you watch it. Which is kind of what they're

493
00:29:13,345 --> 00:29:13,825
Speaker 5:  all doing right now.

494
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:17,465
Speaker 6:  I think Netflix should buy it and just rebrand as HBO

495
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:21,185
Speaker 6:  just as for one day as a bit, just to really knife

496
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:23,635
Speaker 6:  David Zov again,

497
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:28,475
Speaker 5:  Zoff should be fired. I I'm just gonna say it. This has been

498
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:32,235
Speaker 5:  such a disaster. Yes. That whatever border, and I

499
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:34,835
Speaker 5:  realize he's the one who bought it and his company and his deal. And if you

500
00:29:34,835 --> 00:29:38,635
Speaker 5:  read the tiktoks of the deal back when he bought Warner Bros, he was

501
00:29:38,635 --> 00:29:42,325
Speaker 5:  the savior, right? He like pitched at and t on this deal. They

502
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:45,685
Speaker 5:  at and t needed out because they were, they, they woke up one day and realized

503
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:49,565
Speaker 5:  they were at and t and this was, this had been a huge boondoggle and he,

504
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:53,285
Speaker 5:  we like rescued it by engineering the steel and all, you know, he's obviously

505
00:29:53,285 --> 00:29:56,005
Speaker 5:  the source and all these stories. He like all these stories like describe

506
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:59,805
Speaker 5:  the ballrooms and restaurants and that they made the deal in

507
00:29:59,985 --> 00:30:03,845
Speaker 5:  and it's like, dude, you sucked so bad. Like everyone saw it

508
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:07,165
Speaker 5:  coming. You pissed off everyone by canceling shows right away by

509
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:11,205
Speaker 5:  taking tax breaks on things that were already done, whether or not they were

510
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:14,765
Speaker 5:  good. Just a, just a mess. A a creative

511
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:19,365
Speaker 5:  financial mess from the start because this man does not know what

512
00:30:19,365 --> 00:30:23,345
Speaker 5:  he's doing. And if there's a board of directors there, you

513
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:26,185
Speaker 5:  know, in the same way that like maybe Tesla's board of directors should take

514
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:29,625
Speaker 5:  a hard look at how the company's going and they won't. I it feels like

515
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:32,905
Speaker 5:  the Warner Bros discovery Board should take a hard look at what has happened

516
00:30:32,905 --> 00:30:36,625
Speaker 5:  to that company under this management and be like, maybe somebody else

517
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:40,025
Speaker 5:  should do this. Yeah. Maybe when we, when maybe when we sell Warner Bros,

518
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:43,945
Speaker 5:  we ought to rethink this whole situation. 'cause this style of management

519
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:47,345
Speaker 5:  is effectively the only product they have consistently shipped is layoffs.

520
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,865
Speaker 6:  And Jake, to your point, it's not like this is a thing that is only obvious

521
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:55,705
Speaker 6:  in retrospect. Every everyone who was paying attention

522
00:30:56,245 --> 00:31:00,185
Speaker 6:  has been saying this the whole time, including their competitors

523
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:03,745
Speaker 6:  who don't normally say things out loud about the Yes. Who but who were happy

524
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:07,665
Speaker 6:  to be like, boy it seems weird that if if you have HBO you just

525
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,985
Speaker 6:  stop calling it HBO.

526
00:31:09,385 --> 00:31:12,625
Speaker 7:  I really can't think of any other company that has had such a like

527
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:16,945
Speaker 7:  obstinate position. Right. Like neli to to what you're saying.

528
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:21,265
Speaker 7:  They've just been fighting with everybody. Right. Everybody's telling them

529
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:24,545
Speaker 7:  this name change is bad. Everybody's telling them, Hey, maybe you should

530
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:28,065
Speaker 7:  release that movie everybody wants to watch. And they're, they're just like,

531
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:32,105
Speaker 7:  no, we're just gonna like pocket it. We we're, we're gonna save a

532
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:34,105
Speaker 7:  little bit of cash by not finishing it. Dude,

533
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:36,265
Speaker 5:  They lost Christopher Nolan.

534
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:40,305
Speaker 7:  Right, right. Like that is Heads would be spinning

535
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:44,385
Speaker 7:  at like any other functional studio. Yep. Like

536
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:47,945
Speaker 7:  people would be, would have lost their job over that. Right. Yeah.

537
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:51,105
Speaker 7:  People put so much work into

538
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:55,705
Speaker 7:  curating a roster of directors that they can rely on and getting the

539
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:59,505
Speaker 7:  best, you know, movies and shows and, you know, creators

540
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:03,945
Speaker 7:  to their studio. Those things take like ages to

541
00:32:03,945 --> 00:32:07,865
Speaker 7:  build and they just lost it in, in, I mean weeks. Right.

542
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:11,585
Speaker 7:  Like he just right out the door. And it's just been a few years of that and

543
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:15,545
Speaker 7:  it, it, it is puzzling what the strategy is supposed to

544
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:15,825
Speaker 7:  be there.

545
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,545
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The fact that I had to watch Oppenheimer on Peacock is maybe the worst

546
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:20,745
Speaker 6:  thing that David SLO

547
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:20,905
Speaker 7:  Did.

548
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,265
Speaker 5:  Okay. Now you've mentioned Peacock, So I need to disclose

549
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:24,625
Speaker 7:  Oh right. Just sort of a roundabout

550
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,145
Speaker 5:  Way. Their usual block of entertainment disclosures.

551
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:33,145
Speaker 5:  NBCUniversal, whose parent is Comcast is a minority investor in Roxy

552
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:37,025
Speaker 5:  Media. They, they, they hate us. Comcast does.

553
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:38,025
Speaker 5:  And we'll get to why

554
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:38,665
Speaker 7:  Shortly.

555
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:44,405
Speaker 5:  'cause we c we cover them as an ISP like the thing that we do. I

556
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:47,565
Speaker 5:  executive producer of Netflix show, which you can watch called the Future

557
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:51,085
Speaker 5:  of It, it pays us no money when you watch it. So fine.

558
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:55,085
Speaker 5:  That deal, that deal is long since over and in general we subscribe to all

559
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:57,925
Speaker 5:  these streaming services. I, there used to be more and we have a TikTok account,

560
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:01,045
Speaker 5:  it's at to Coder pod. It's like whatever you want. It's, we're, we're, we're

561
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:04,725
Speaker 5:  all tied up in all these things. But you know, it's not like these

562
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:06,645
Speaker 5:  companies have any love loss for our coverage.

563
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:11,005
Speaker 5:  The Nolan thing is like particularly interesting, right? Like you have a

564
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:15,445
Speaker 5:  director whose name alone allows you to be like, we're gonna spend

565
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:19,685
Speaker 5:  $400 trillion on a series of movies that are a

566
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:23,445
Speaker 5:  deep introspection on the nature of love and memory. And then, and they,

567
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:24,405
Speaker 5:  they will all be hits

568
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:28,645
Speaker 5:  cool. It's like, you don't lose that guy. No

569
00:33:28,645 --> 00:33:29,765
Speaker 6:  One will understand any of them.

570
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:35,405
Speaker 5:  What? And he's like, what? We're just gonna, we're gonna let that guy walk.

571
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:38,285
Speaker 5:  And it's because they insisted on, on releasing day and date

572
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:42,035
Speaker 5:  with the streaming service. 'cause they, they thought the streaming service

573
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:45,995
Speaker 5:  was the point. And if you are Warner Bros, the point is making the

574
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:49,635
Speaker 5:  movies. If you're HBO the Point is making the great shows, not the

575
00:33:49,635 --> 00:33:53,435
Speaker 5:  streaming service. Yes, you need to have the business to support that effort.

576
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,585
Speaker 5:  But the thing that's valuable is the work. You know, we talk about Netflix,

577
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,905
Speaker 5:  they're quickly coming to place where the thing that's valuable is the service

578
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:05,345
Speaker 5:  and the work is just sort of fine and it's medium and it it, it propels it

579
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:09,025
Speaker 5:  along and everyone is jealous of that. But you can't get there

580
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:11,065
Speaker 5:  unless you have their scale and you never will. Even

581
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:14,705
Speaker 6:  Netflix is, is starting to run into troubles with that. Right? Like there

582
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:18,345
Speaker 6:  was all this reporting a while ago about the, after the huge Barbie hit,

583
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:21,345
Speaker 6:  Greta Gerwig is doing Chronicles of Narnia movies and they had this big fight

584
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:25,185
Speaker 6:  over Greta Gerwig wanted it to be in theaters because people

585
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:27,905
Speaker 6:  who make films want them to be in theaters. Netflix was like, no, we don't

586
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:30,505
Speaker 6:  do theaters. And so they had this big fight and eventually Greta Gerwig won

587
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:34,265
Speaker 6:  and it's gonna get a theatrical run. So like Netflix is, is

588
00:34:34,265 --> 00:34:37,985
Speaker 6:  desperately trying to get away from the work, mattering in in a lot of ways,

589
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:42,105
Speaker 6:  but I think is still able to play that game the right way.

590
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:46,105
Speaker 6:  And all David Zaslav seems to be able to do is just swing from zero

591
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:48,145
Speaker 6:  to a hundred. Those are his only two moves.

592
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,985
Speaker 7:  I don't really know what's in Netflix's interest at this point. To, to

593
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:56,305
Speaker 7:  not a a allow those theatrical runs. Right. Especially if you're going to

594
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:59,985
Speaker 7:  make movies that are allegedly supposed to be, you know, big

595
00:34:59,985 --> 00:35:03,905
Speaker 7:  budget hits. That's how you build buzz. People

596
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,585
Speaker 7:  like seeing things in theaters. Don't get me wrong, it's great. Like I,

597
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:11,545
Speaker 7:  during the pandemic when I could just be like, boop, zoom like

598
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:15,145
Speaker 7:  boop and, and watch Dune on like the first. Like it's great. Love it.

599
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:20,625
Speaker 7:  But if you're gonna, you know, upset an entire community

600
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:24,505
Speaker 7:  of people who you need to rely on to make the stuff that makes your

601
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:28,465
Speaker 7:  business, maybe you should just do that. Right. Especially if it's going

602
00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:29,825
Speaker 7:  to make you a lot more money. There's

603
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:32,105
Speaker 5:  Just a vanishing number of people with the leverage to do that.

604
00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:32,625
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

605
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:36,705
Speaker 5:  Like, and I think it's in Netflix's interest to make sure there, there's

606
00:35:36,705 --> 00:35:38,285
Speaker 5:  never another Christopher Nolan. Mm.

607
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:42,405
Speaker 6:  Right. I mean the, the F1 movie this summer is gonna be a really interesting

608
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:46,325
Speaker 6:  test case here because it is, it is such a big swing.

609
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:50,125
Speaker 6:  It's a big movie. It's gonna be in theaters, it's Brad Pitt. A lot of people

610
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,845
Speaker 6:  are paying attention that like, it's gonna be super ugly

611
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:57,285
Speaker 6:  for Apple if this doesn't work. And I've heard a bunch of people who are

612
00:35:57,285 --> 00:36:01,165
Speaker 6:  really concerned that it is not going to work. And unless this

613
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:05,085
Speaker 6:  thing is a big giant hit, it's gonna, I suspect make every streamer

614
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:09,045
Speaker 6:  look even more sideways at the idea of like really giving these

615
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:12,925
Speaker 6:  things a public run. Like they don't share numbers for a reason and you have

616
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:14,085
Speaker 6:  to when it goes to theaters.

617
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:17,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I have a lot of feelings for that F1 movie.

618
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:22,515
Speaker 5:  I suspect it will not be a hit just having watched the trailers. I think

619
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:25,635
Speaker 5:  they're trying to Days of Thunder F1, you know what I mean? Yeah.

620
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:26,155
Speaker 6:  And like

621
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:29,755
Speaker 5:  Days of Thunder only worked 'cause it was, it was Top Gun again.

622
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:33,905
Speaker 5:  Like literally it was just, they were like, well that was a great movie.

623
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,585
Speaker 5:  We haven't invented sequels yet. It's the eighties. We're gonna do Top Gun

624
00:36:37,585 --> 00:36:37,785
Speaker 5:  Two

625
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,705
Speaker 6:  Top Gun but on the ground. Yeah.

626
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:43,865
Speaker 5:  And it was like way more expensive and way worse in like lots of ways and

627
00:36:43,865 --> 00:36:46,305
Speaker 5:  it whatever. But like

628
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:51,165
Speaker 5:  literally like structurally that movie worked because you're like,

629
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:54,645
Speaker 5:  what Tom Cruise is gonna do is drive faster than everyone else at the end

630
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,625
Speaker 5:  of this movie. Yep. And like F1 fans know that

631
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:02,545
Speaker 5:  that is not a thing an F1 car can just do, do you know what I

632
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:02,625
Speaker 5:  mean?

633
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:05,385
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They're all pretty much going as fast as they can all the time. Right.

634
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:08,105
Speaker 5:  And the cars are different in a way that NASCAR cars are like, there's like

635
00:37:08,105 --> 00:37:11,985
Speaker 5:  a literally a plot point in, in

636
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:15,025
Speaker 5:  in Days of Thunder where they're like, you have to learn how to drive the

637
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,985
Speaker 5:  car. And he is like, sure. And like, you can't do that in F1.

638
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:23,105
Speaker 5:  Like, like this movie is going to make no sense 'cause they're gonna try

639
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:25,705
Speaker 5:  to Days of Thunder F1 and every F1 fan is gonna be mad.

640
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:26,065
Speaker 6:  Yes.

641
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:29,195
Speaker 5:  We'll just see how it goes. It's

642
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:31,155
Speaker 6:  Gonna go great. What could possibly, what could possibly go great

643
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:34,595
Speaker 5:  Also the the last Brad Pitt movie, the George Clean Wolfs

644
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:38,665
Speaker 5:  on Apple tv. Like didn't, it was fine. It was extremely fine.

645
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:42,905
Speaker 6:  It was extremely, it was the most plain movie I've watched in a long

646
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:43,105
Speaker 6:  time.

647
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:47,815
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean it it, it was, it was like so deeply fine

648
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:51,135
Speaker 5:  in a way that like you get the sense they were trying to make Mr. And Mrs. Smith

649
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:55,115
Speaker 5:  again, but like George Clooney was Angelina Jolie and you're

650
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:57,755
Speaker 5:  like, well there's still, there's still an odd amount of sexual attention

651
00:37:57,785 --> 00:37:59,915
Speaker 5:  here. Like Oh yeah. Much more than I expected.

652
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:00,315
Speaker 6:  Oh

653
00:38:00,315 --> 00:38:01,675
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But not, it's not

654
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:02,915
Speaker 6:  Mr I ship the two of For sure.

655
00:38:03,345 --> 00:38:07,275
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Anyhow, we'll see how that goes. There's more streaming news in this

656
00:38:07,345 --> 00:38:10,675
Speaker 5:  zone because Yeah. None of these people can stop asking you for money.

657
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:15,275
Speaker 5:  Speaking of plans that have gone away and come back and once again

658
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:19,355
Speaker 5:  risen. ESPN is launching its own app for $30 a month. 'cause I think

659
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:22,675
Speaker 5:  they've realized the cable bundle can't save Disney. It's, it's, it's over.

660
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:27,435
Speaker 5:  Fox is gonna launch it's sports app. It's called Fox One.

661
00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:30,515
Speaker 5:  It doesn't launch for the NFL season. That's when you would do it. It's not

662
00:38:30,515 --> 00:38:34,475
Speaker 6:  Technically just sports, it's also for, you know, right

663
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:37,885
Speaker 6:  wing propaganda and, and various other things. But it's mostly for sports.

664
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:39,485
Speaker 6:  All of these are mostly for sports.

665
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:42,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. 'cause that's what they have the rights to. Right. And they've all

666
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:46,165
Speaker 5:  spent billions of dollars buying these rights. Yes. I And

667
00:38:46,195 --> 00:38:49,725
Speaker 5:  like there's just moves that are, YouTube has Sunday ticket, they're gonna

668
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:53,645
Speaker 5:  stream in NFL game for free when the season kicks off.

669
00:38:54,575 --> 00:38:58,205
Speaker 5:  There is just a thing here where like live sports is the last thing that

670
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,605
Speaker 5:  can bring everyone together. Like it's not even award shows anymore because

671
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:02,485
Speaker 5:  no one's seen any of the movies.

672
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:03,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

673
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:07,645
Speaker 5:  Like there's just a thing here that's like really happening and

674
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:11,485
Speaker 5:  it's at the end of this, you're kind of like, man, we're gonna be paying

675
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:13,805
Speaker 5:  substantially more than cable bundles ever were.

676
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:17,765
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. And there was a, there was a great thing going around the other

677
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:21,405
Speaker 6:  day after all this got announced. 'cause to your point that's you just named

678
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:25,325
Speaker 6:  three new places to watch football this coming season. And,

679
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:29,045
Speaker 6:  and now it's like you're up to legitimately like 10 streaming services

680
00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:31,965
Speaker 6:  you're gonna need if you wanna watch all the games

681
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:36,635
Speaker 6:  next year of the NFL season. 'cause like Netflix has Christmas games again,

682
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:40,355
Speaker 6:  they're, they're spread across all the different services again. Like it's

683
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:44,075
Speaker 6:  awful and it's only gonna keep getting worse because that to your point,

684
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:47,795
Speaker 6:  is the only thing that these companies have found that lots and lots of people

685
00:39:47,795 --> 00:39:51,595
Speaker 6:  will reliably go to on purpose and jump through

686
00:39:51,795 --> 00:39:55,315
Speaker 6:  whatever hoops they have to. Like, I will, I will do whatever is required

687
00:39:55,335 --> 00:39:58,995
Speaker 6:  to watch football is only true about football and basically nothing else.

688
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:03,075
Speaker 7:  There's also something interesting, interesting there in, in that, I can't

689
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:06,795
Speaker 7:  think of anything else where like the rights are so spread out

690
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:10,675
Speaker 7:  like that, right? Like it's not like YouTube can get one Spider-Man

691
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:14,515
Speaker 7:  movie. Like that's just not a thing. Right. With ip It it, but the,

692
00:40:14,575 --> 00:40:18,435
Speaker 7:  the, the licensing deals for all the different networks are

693
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:22,395
Speaker 7:  so spread out and split up that you have the situation where, I have no idea

694
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,435
Speaker 7:  why YouTube was only able to acquire one

695
00:40:26,475 --> 00:40:30,035
Speaker 7:  NFL game, but people are gonna go find it there because they like

696
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:35,045
Speaker 7:  football, they like the NFL, they're going to watch it and you just

697
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:38,325
Speaker 7:  can't do that with anything else since they're able to get the property onto

698
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:41,485
Speaker 7:  their platform. And it just works like beyond the fact that yes, obviously

699
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:44,645
Speaker 7:  sports is incredibly popular and people would watch it no matter what.

700
00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:48,285
Speaker 5:  Well also the, you know, the the rights holders are are differently

701
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:52,365
Speaker 5:  situated. So if you are, well it's, it's funny 'cause

702
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:56,605
Speaker 5:  Disney owns everything now, but at the time if you were Marvel

703
00:40:57,465 --> 00:41:00,845
Speaker 5:  you could sell Spider-Man to, to

704
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:04,725
Speaker 5:  Sony and X-Men to Fox

705
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:07,805
Speaker 5:  and the rest of the characters you would like make your own weird movies

706
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,965
Speaker 5:  on with John Favreau. And that turned out to be a really big deal. Right.

707
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,565
Speaker 5:  And they didn't know what would work and what wouldn't work. Right.

708
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:18,535
Speaker 5:  Sports leagues every game is like, it

709
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:22,375
Speaker 5:  has a value in a moment of time and then that value goes to zero. And so

710
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:25,975
Speaker 5:  they are very much incentivized to not sell like

711
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:30,015
Speaker 5:  franchises or long running things to let people go and try to get value out

712
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:33,055
Speaker 5:  of over time. They're very much incentivized to be like, all right, you can

713
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,085
Speaker 5:  can have Thursday and you can have Sunday and you can have, you know, the

714
00:41:36,085 --> 00:41:39,925
Speaker 5:  slate of games during the week because after it's done

715
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:41,685
Speaker 5:  there's no residual value.

716
00:41:42,385 --> 00:41:44,135
Speaker 6:  Right. They have to make an event of it

717
00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:45,135
Speaker 5:  Every single

718
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:46,175
Speaker 6:  And that incentivizes them 'cause they,

719
00:41:46,365 --> 00:41:46,975
Speaker 5:  It's over for.

720
00:41:47,035 --> 00:41:47,695
Speaker 6:  That's done. There's,

721
00:41:47,695 --> 00:41:50,295
Speaker 5:  There's no catalog value. And you can see they don't even really care about

722
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:53,255
Speaker 5:  like old highlights and like Right, right. Like they're just like, whatever.

723
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:55,655
Speaker 5:  You can have it. 'cause all that is just advertising for whatever's gonna

724
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:58,855
Speaker 5:  happen next in a way that like, you know, Marvel

725
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:03,055
Speaker 5:  gets tons of values from Avengers and Game continuing to exist forever.

726
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:08,235
Speaker 5:  And it, it is like, it's just a very different posture for the leagues and

727
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:12,195
Speaker 5:  they are, they have become incredibly good at milking it

728
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:16,195
Speaker 5:  in a way that I would say has forced

729
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:18,515
Speaker 5:  many people to consider sailing the stormy seas.

730
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:24,315
Speaker 6:  And, and it's easier and easier all the time to do so. But no,

731
00:42:24,315 --> 00:42:25,075
Speaker 6:  I mean, and you look at it,

732
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,355
Speaker 5:  You get a boat for nothing. And

733
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:30,115
Speaker 6:  Like the way that you get all of this stuff is like the, the

734
00:42:30,155 --> 00:42:33,635
Speaker 6:  NFL in particular has done a really good job of

735
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:38,435
Speaker 6:  getting around its own contracts. Like they keep coming up with

736
00:42:38,495 --> 00:42:42,035
Speaker 6:  new days to have games. They keep calling the games new kinds of things.

737
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:45,675
Speaker 6:  They keep putting them in new places because they have these

738
00:42:45,675 --> 00:42:49,595
Speaker 6:  incredibly specific deals about where things

739
00:42:49,655 --> 00:42:53,395
Speaker 6:  can be and when, and I mean if you remember, it wasn't all that long ago

740
00:42:53,395 --> 00:42:56,595
Speaker 6:  that Verizon had NFL games

741
00:42:57,115 --> 00:43:00,195
Speaker 6:  specifically on mobile, but you could only watch them on your phone because

742
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:02,875
Speaker 6:  that was the deal that Verizon had made on mobile. So if you wanted to watch

743
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,315
Speaker 6:  NFL games on your phone, you had to have Verizon. But if you had Verizon,

744
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,955
Speaker 6:  you couldn't watch NFL games on anything other than your phone. Like the

745
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:12,715
Speaker 6:  NFL is now worth so much money. And it, it is the only

746
00:43:12,725 --> 00:43:15,635
Speaker 6:  thing that actually can claim to be an event that way.

747
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:19,995
Speaker 6:  Like you're seeing baseball deals go down and other sports league are going

748
00:43:19,995 --> 00:43:23,435
Speaker 6:  down in their their deals because no one is

749
00:43:23,655 --> 00:43:27,355
Speaker 6:  tuning in in that way. And people will not jump through hoops to sign up

750
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:30,315
Speaker 6:  for Amazon just to watch a Cincinnati Reds game anymore.

751
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:34,835
Speaker 6:  But they will with football games. And so the, the price keeps going up and

752
00:43:34,835 --> 00:43:38,475
Speaker 6:  they keep finding new ways to slice and dice it. And it is truly, truly

753
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:42,115
Speaker 6:  awful as a fan, but as a, like the Harvard

754
00:43:42,635 --> 00:43:44,835
Speaker 6:  Business School case study is like pretty spectacular.

755
00:43:46,105 --> 00:43:49,995
Speaker 5:  It's very funny that even the NFL's like slicing and dicing of its schedule

756
00:43:50,185 --> 00:43:54,155
Speaker 5:  into different days, the days have be, have gotten reputations. Like

757
00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:57,315
Speaker 5:  you just know that you can drink your way through a Thursday half football

758
00:43:57,315 --> 00:43:57,435
Speaker 5:  game

759
00:43:58,065 --> 00:43:58,355
Speaker 6:  Fine.

760
00:43:59,785 --> 00:44:03,515
Speaker 5:  Like the value of these different things. If it's funny how they just like

761
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,355
Speaker 5:  sort themselves out. Alright, we got to, we wanna end here

762
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:11,395
Speaker 5:  on again, just to remind everyone, the only thing David SLO has ever

763
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:15,315
Speaker 5:  created is layoffs. Yep. And Max was a disaster and he stole my child's name,

764
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:18,035
Speaker 5:  which I'm still pissed about, but now it's back.

765
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:21,715
Speaker 6:  You're gonna name your second child HBO. Right? Just to, just to really bring

766
00:44:21,715 --> 00:44:22,275
Speaker 6:  it full circle

767
00:44:23,905 --> 00:44:25,675
Speaker 5:  Baby boy Peacock Patel is

768
00:44:26,535 --> 00:44:27,275
Speaker 6:  Oh, I like that.

769
00:44:27,905 --> 00:44:31,765
Speaker 5:  It's naming this kid's hard. It's, it's, it's very challenging. I I will

770
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:35,605
Speaker 5:  accept your recommendations. Max actually has a very strong point of view

771
00:44:37,305 --> 00:44:40,805
Speaker 5:  and she's gonna win because we have nothing, we have nothing to stand up

772
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:44,525
Speaker 5:  to her with right now. So let me know what, let me know what you think. All

773
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:46,605
Speaker 5:  right. We have a take a break. We're gonna come back. There's lots gonna

774
00:44:46,605 --> 00:44:47,885
Speaker 5:  talk about, I'm gonna episode of verse House

775
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:08,485
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. We're gonna do it. We're gonna, we're gonna pay off

776
00:47:08,485 --> 00:47:11,965
Speaker 5:  the thing that we teased in the intro, which I would say we have a

777
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:15,605
Speaker 5:  50% success rate of doing. Yeah. Seems generous, but

778
00:47:15,605 --> 00:47:16,165
Speaker 2:  I'll take it.

779
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:20,725
Speaker 5:  So we're, we're gonna do it. Lots and lots of news this week. Lots of gadget

780
00:47:20,725 --> 00:47:24,485
Speaker 5:  news. Lots of tech news. We gotta start with like a finally,

781
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:29,855
Speaker 5:  I I feel like a finally is worth it. Apple has announced that what

782
00:47:29,855 --> 00:47:33,095
Speaker 5:  it is now calling CarPlay Ultra is going to arrive

783
00:47:33,805 --> 00:47:37,775
Speaker 5:  it's shipping first on new Aston Martin cars and then if you

784
00:47:37,885 --> 00:47:41,815
Speaker 5:  have a new Aston Martin with the latest infotainment

785
00:47:41,815 --> 00:47:43,935
Speaker 5:  system, you can go to your dealer and get a software update and then you,

786
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:47,215
Speaker 5:  you two will have CarPlay Ultra then they announced there is coming to a

787
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:50,975
Speaker 5:  bunch of other car car companies. Porsche is supposed to do it. They

788
00:47:50,975 --> 00:47:54,575
Speaker 5:  announced that Hyundai Kia and Genesis would also get it, which are new partners.

789
00:47:54,835 --> 00:47:58,255
Speaker 5:  No timelines in any of this stuff. Yeah. CarVal Ultra is a concept

790
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:02,495
Speaker 5:  we've covered very closely, like so closely that when I was

791
00:48:02,495 --> 00:48:06,215
Speaker 5:  searching for our own coverage and I typed Neli Patel CarPlay

792
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:10,255
Speaker 5:  Google generated full AI summary of my opinions

793
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:10,895
Speaker 5:  about CarPlay.

794
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:15,695
Speaker 5:  Like we, there's a lot of us talking about CarPlay over the years. So several

795
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:19,625
Speaker 5:  years ago with 2023, I wanna say Apple announced Next

796
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:23,585
Speaker 5:  Gen CarPlay and it was just a picture of the, you know, an interior of

797
00:48:23,585 --> 00:48:26,625
Speaker 5:  a car with lots of screens and it was all CarPlay. And they're like, we're

798
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:29,065
Speaker 5:  doing it. And then they put up a slide, if you remember this, they put up

799
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:31,625
Speaker 5:  a, a slide with like every Car Maker's logo.

800
00:48:33,175 --> 00:48:36,795
Speaker 5:  And what we learned is that many of those car makers were surprised

801
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,075
Speaker 5:  by their inclusion on this slide. Like they're like, what are you talking

802
00:48:40,075 --> 00:48:43,155
Speaker 5:  about? Yeah. Because they all had regular CarPlay, which people like,

803
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:46,235
Speaker 5:  and Apple was just like, of course, of course they're gonna do what we tell

804
00:48:46,235 --> 00:48:50,075
Speaker 5:  them to do. And they, they were not ready for this. A year later

805
00:48:50,185 --> 00:48:54,035
Speaker 5:  last year, apple had announced no partners for next generation

806
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:57,755
Speaker 5:  CarPlay. They had said to Porsche and asked Martin would do it by the end

807
00:48:57,755 --> 00:49:00,235
Speaker 5:  of last year. And that didn't happen. And then like

808
00:49:00,235 --> 00:49:04,115
Speaker 6:  Sneakily removed that mention from their website. Yeah, it was, it,

809
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:07,435
Speaker 6:  it's, it got further and further away as time went on, it seemed,

810
00:49:07,855 --> 00:49:11,435
Speaker 5:  And then they announced a bunch of technical details about how this next

811
00:49:11,435 --> 00:49:14,515
Speaker 5:  generation of CarPlay would work. I wrote a lot about that. I took a lot

812
00:49:14,515 --> 00:49:18,355
Speaker 5:  of meetings. I've had a lot of car company CEOs on decoder and

813
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,515
Speaker 5:  asked them straight up, are you gonna do this? And most of them have said

814
00:49:21,575 --> 00:49:24,955
Speaker 5:  no. Famously at Mercedes, CEO Lanius said, no,

815
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,235
Speaker 5:  Rivian, CEO RJ Sccr said, no. We've had the heads of product

816
00:49:29,385 --> 00:49:32,755
Speaker 5:  from GM on, he, he was not impressed by, it's like

817
00:49:33,545 --> 00:49:36,235
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of car companies that are like, we are not gonna give up our

818
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:40,155
Speaker 5:  interface to Apple. Like we have our own ideas about software and services.

819
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:42,995
Speaker 5:  You might think they're horrible ideas, and in many cases they are. Yep.

820
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:46,515
Speaker 5:  But they are their own companies and they would like to own their own relationships

821
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:49,555
Speaker 5:  with customers. And that's just how it goes. So Apple had to re-architect

822
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:52,595
Speaker 5:  all of this from, we're gonna take over all your screens and

823
00:49:53,145 --> 00:49:56,155
Speaker 5:  CarPlay will be the future of the car to this literally

824
00:49:56,385 --> 00:50:00,315
Speaker 5:  multi-layered approach to what the car companies control and what Apple controls

825
00:50:00,315 --> 00:50:04,195
Speaker 5:  and all these like hybrid bits and bobs in the middle. It has taken 'em

826
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:07,875
Speaker 5:  forever to get even one of these cars shipped with these deals in place.

827
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:12,275
Speaker 5:  And the way I would characterize it is that it's a complete walk

828
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:16,255
Speaker 5:  back. Like they've, they're announcing CarPlay Ultra and yes,

829
00:50:16,255 --> 00:50:19,295
Speaker 5:  there's all this stuff you can do in the car with your phone now, but if

830
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:23,055
Speaker 5:  you just take a minute to like look at what it is, you're like, oh,

831
00:50:23,055 --> 00:50:27,005
Speaker 5:  they, they're, it's kind of nothing like, I, I don't

832
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:29,605
Speaker 5:  wanna be like too rude. It's, it's something, it was, obviously it's a long

833
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:32,485
Speaker 5:  time and they, but they had to do it. But the actual

834
00:50:33,235 --> 00:50:35,685
Speaker 5:  practical effect of it is so small.

835
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:39,925
Speaker 7:  I'm genuinely confused what they have put in all of this work for CarPlay

836
00:50:39,925 --> 00:50:43,885
Speaker 7:  makes a ton of sense, right? It is fantastic. You can use your phone to

837
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:47,245
Speaker 7:  control things in your car. It gets rid of a bunch of the worst parts of

838
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:51,005
Speaker 7:  car controls CarPlay Ultra. Like, do I need an

839
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:55,285
Speaker 7:  iOS themed speedometer? Like I, that seems like, what else does it

840
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:59,045
Speaker 7:  do? What does it do for me that meaningfully improves the car experience?

841
00:50:59,195 --> 00:51:00,125
Speaker 7:  What does it do for Apple?

842
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:04,085
Speaker 5:  So I know exactly what it does for Apple, which is as you're using your apps

843
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:08,005
Speaker 5:  in the car and you're pushing the buttons in the apps, those apps are actually

844
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:10,805
Speaker 5:  running on your phone and Apple's collecting its 30% cut.

845
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:14,985
Speaker 5:  That's what it does for Apple, right? It puts their operating system and

846
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:18,345
Speaker 5:  their business model front and center as you're operating your car.

847
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:22,545
Speaker 5:  That's a big deal. That's their business. And it keeps

848
00:51:22,605 --> 00:51:25,625
Speaker 5:  the automakers from putting their business models front and center of the

849
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,985
Speaker 5:  car, which is the entire tension. GM's entire, like

850
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:32,505
Speaker 5:  conception of itself right now is like we're a software vendor and it's like,

851
00:51:32,565 --> 00:51:36,545
Speaker 5:  are you, and I dunno if that's real or not, but like that's what they wanna

852
00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:40,065
Speaker 5:  do. They want have services in the car. Tesla's conception of Itself's very

853
00:51:40,065 --> 00:51:43,865
Speaker 5:  much as a software maker. So as Rivian, like they believe that they should

854
00:51:43,865 --> 00:51:46,505
Speaker 5:  own a customer relationship of people doing stuff in the car, particularly

855
00:51:46,505 --> 00:51:49,785
Speaker 5:  as a car start driving themselves. So for Apple, a CarPlay Ultra is

856
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:53,585
Speaker 5:  if you're gonna buy stuff in your car, we want 30%

857
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:55,945
Speaker 5:  Apple. Like what, what else is their business model?

858
00:51:56,145 --> 00:51:58,985
Speaker 7:  I see. So there's, this is a long play, right? Like I'm not, I'm not

859
00:51:59,655 --> 00:52:00,145
Speaker 7:  playing

860
00:52:02,045 --> 00:52:05,985
Speaker 7:  got Angry Birds in the car right now, but like eventually, you know, yeah.

861
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:09,985
Speaker 7:  It's, and and it'll, it'll theme itself based on how fast my car is

862
00:52:09,985 --> 00:52:10,665
Speaker 7:  automatically driving,

863
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:14,625
Speaker 5:  Right? The idea is that, that there shouldn't be another software ecosystem

864
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:17,705
Speaker 5:  that you participate in your car, right? And you can kinda dress straight

865
00:52:17,705 --> 00:52:21,585
Speaker 5:  line like people like CarPlay, like we should do more with CarPlay. And

866
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:25,225
Speaker 5:  then there's this real tension in the industry over, well

867
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,905
Speaker 5:  eventually the cars will drive themselves and we're gonna turn the all these

868
00:52:27,905 --> 00:52:31,625
Speaker 5:  screens into shopping malls and who gets the money and who gets, keeps credit

869
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:35,065
Speaker 5:  cards. And, and, and that's just gonna play itself out. The, what the

870
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:39,185
Speaker 5:  automakers have like really been wondering about is like, Hey,

871
00:52:39,805 --> 00:52:43,585
Speaker 5:  we don't want all the cars to look the same. Right? You, you get

872
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:45,945
Speaker 5:  into an Aston Martin, it should look different than a Porsche. It should

873
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:49,505
Speaker 5:  look different than a Hyundai. So we need all this design control, which

874
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:53,185
Speaker 5:  Apple did not want to give up initially. And so they ended in this place

875
00:52:53,955 --> 00:52:57,705
Speaker 5:  where I suspect CarPlay Ultra

876
00:52:57,705 --> 00:53:01,145
Speaker 5:  will just stop being relevant very fast. Because

877
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:04,825
Speaker 5:  what they've done is they've broken the car's UI

878
00:53:05,495 --> 00:53:08,625
Speaker 5:  into layers. And so there's one layer that runs

879
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:11,905
Speaker 5:  locally in the car that has nothing to do with your phone that has been themed

880
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:15,745
Speaker 5:  with by Apple and the car maker together. That's like your speedometer, your

881
00:53:15,745 --> 00:53:19,545
Speaker 5:  turn signals the odometer, which you can't screw with federally, right?

882
00:53:19,545 --> 00:53:23,465
Speaker 5:  Like there's some stuff that you just can't connect to

883
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:27,485
Speaker 5:  a phone like you, it has to be there. So then the automaker gets that

884
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:31,165
Speaker 5:  locally. Then there's the first time you plug your, you know, your

885
00:53:31,235 --> 00:53:34,725
Speaker 5:  CarPlay phone into your CarPlay Ultra car, it like

886
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:38,925
Speaker 5:  downloads a bunch of themes and graphics packages that Apple has designed

887
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:42,965
Speaker 5:  in connection with the car maker, right? So I'm guessing what that means

888
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:46,805
Speaker 5:  is Apple designed it for them. Like no knowing Apple, they, they did it

889
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:49,805
Speaker 5:  for the car maker and that downloads to your car and then you get a bunch

890
00:53:49,805 --> 00:53:53,405
Speaker 5:  of themes for this speedometer and other stuff that are still local,

891
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:57,805
Speaker 5:  like the car's doing them. But the, the design comes

892
00:53:57,875 --> 00:54:00,205
Speaker 5:  over the air from Apple through your phone and then you can like click through

893
00:54:00,205 --> 00:54:03,765
Speaker 5:  it and then you get stuff like maps in the cluster and all the stuff. And

894
00:54:03,765 --> 00:54:07,085
Speaker 5:  then the last piece, which is I think super

895
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:11,445
Speaker 5:  interesting 'cause it's the thing that Apple I think had to give up is

896
00:54:11,445 --> 00:54:15,295
Speaker 5:  called punch through ui where the car maker has a bunch

897
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,815
Speaker 5:  of stuff that it wants to do

898
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:22,355
Speaker 5:  the rear view camera. Yep. The controls for a

899
00:54:22,355 --> 00:54:26,275
Speaker 5:  fancy audio system, the massaging seat controls like a lot

900
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:30,235
Speaker 5:  of this stuff where it doesn't want to make

901
00:54:30,235 --> 00:54:34,225
Speaker 5:  it twice, right? Here's whatever custom fancy feature we've built

902
00:54:34,225 --> 00:54:36,785
Speaker 5:  for this car. We don't want to redesign it with Apple.

903
00:54:38,385 --> 00:54:42,195
Speaker 5:  That just comes through CarPlay, it punches through the CarPlay

904
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:45,835
Speaker 5:  interface. And so you push a button and you just see the Car Maker's ui.

905
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:50,275
Speaker 5:  So now you have this like mishmash of stuff, which is exactly ends the

906
00:54:50,275 --> 00:54:53,315
Speaker 5:  promise of Apple will take over all the screens in your car.

907
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:57,855
Speaker 5:  'cause now it's gone from, at least it's bad. But Consi now it's, 'cause

908
00:54:57,855 --> 00:55:01,735
Speaker 5:  now it's gone from it's bad car maker ui, but at least it's consistent to,

909
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:05,495
Speaker 5:  it's mostly Apple design stuff. And if you hit the wrong button, the

910
00:55:05,495 --> 00:55:09,175
Speaker 5:  Carmaker's bad UI shows up and you've gotta use that screen. And I don't,

911
00:55:09,215 --> 00:55:10,975
Speaker 5:  I just like, dunno how that's gonna play out. Do

912
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:13,935
Speaker 6:  You remember back in the day with like smart TVs, everybody would do their

913
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:17,895
Speaker 6:  really like overwrought skin on top of Android, but then you'd open up settings

914
00:55:17,895 --> 00:55:21,615
Speaker 6:  and it would just be like the basic honeycomb Android thing. Like that's

915
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:25,535
Speaker 6:  what this is. And it's, it's not good ui. But I

916
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:29,455
Speaker 6:  also feel like there's been this macro shift since Apple launched this

917
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:31,615
Speaker 6:  the first time three years ago,

918
00:55:33,635 --> 00:55:37,455
Speaker 6:  people went buttons like this. I I just went back and looked at,

919
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:40,615
Speaker 6:  there's a, there's a picture in Apple's press release

920
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:45,255
Speaker 6:  happily announcing that it has launched CarPlay Ultra, which sure.

921
00:55:47,525 --> 00:55:51,325
Speaker 6:  Compared to the picture that they showed off the, when it was called

922
00:55:51,325 --> 00:55:55,165
Speaker 6:  Next Generation CarPlay at ww DC back in 2022. It was even earlier

923
00:55:55,165 --> 00:55:58,965
Speaker 6:  than I remembered. And the, the thing

924
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:02,885
Speaker 6:  from 2022 is just screens everywhere, right? So the, the

925
00:56:02,885 --> 00:56:06,725
Speaker 6:  way it, it imagines this is sort of one wide horizontal

926
00:56:06,725 --> 00:56:10,485
Speaker 6:  screen all the way across the front of the car and then big huge

927
00:56:10,485 --> 00:56:13,765
Speaker 6:  infotainment thing in the middle that looks sort of like standard CarPlay

928
00:56:13,765 --> 00:56:17,605
Speaker 6:  only more. So that was the idea and that was how everybody was showing

929
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:21,525
Speaker 6:  off concept cars back in the day. The Aston Martin one

930
00:56:22,185 --> 00:56:25,945
Speaker 6:  is a pretty small screen in the center of a console

931
00:56:26,455 --> 00:56:30,305
Speaker 6:  with a bunch of buttons. Like it just, it just looks like a car screen.

932
00:56:30,325 --> 00:56:34,145
Speaker 6:  And so it's actually like a pretty small CarPlay display. And then

933
00:56:34,145 --> 00:56:37,945
Speaker 6:  Jake, to your point, the only new thing here is a

934
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:42,025
Speaker 6:  speedometer that Apple designed that you can put, you can put Apple

935
00:56:42,175 --> 00:56:45,465
Speaker 6:  Maps in, in the center of the instrument cluster so that you can see it,

936
00:56:45,465 --> 00:56:48,145
Speaker 6:  you get a little tiny heads up display and there's a couple different color

937
00:56:48,145 --> 00:56:51,945
Speaker 6:  themes. Yeah. Like the, the ambition of this thing, at least as

938
00:56:51,945 --> 00:56:54,185
Speaker 6:  it's been rolled out now again, there, there might be more cars, there might

939
00:56:54,185 --> 00:56:57,625
Speaker 6:  be other stuff going on, but at least this first instantiation of it is so

940
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:01,505
Speaker 6:  much smaller than what Apple was pitching at the

941
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:05,315
Speaker 6:  beginning. That it, it's kind of, if it had just described this, we

942
00:57:05,315 --> 00:57:07,315
Speaker 6:  would've been like, oh sure, that kind of makes sense. That that's cool.

943
00:57:07,315 --> 00:57:10,555
Speaker 6:  It's like a, it's like an extension of the look of CarPlay onto the other

944
00:57:10,555 --> 00:57:13,145
Speaker 6:  screen that you look at in your car. But

945
00:57:13,145 --> 00:57:16,975
Speaker 5:  Again, functionally it is not. Right. The thing you're gonna

946
00:57:17,195 --> 00:57:20,335
Speaker 5:  get from we skinned the cluster is

947
00:57:20,765 --> 00:57:24,655
Speaker 5:  between the speedometer and the tachometer is a middle display

948
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:28,615
Speaker 5:  that can show another view of CarPlay apps. Yeah. Which lots

949
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:32,485
Speaker 5:  of cars already have now. Right? So like functionally Yep. They Apple

950
00:57:32,845 --> 00:57:35,645
Speaker 5:  designed the speedometer and then you asked more. It's like, oh, that's,

951
00:57:35,645 --> 00:57:39,605
Speaker 5:  that's nothing. Right? Like Right. And then it's the Center of CarPlay

952
00:57:39,605 --> 00:57:43,325
Speaker 5:  experience is still the same as it was. If you look at the picture, it's

953
00:57:43,325 --> 00:57:46,165
Speaker 5:  still just a grid of icons. It is, it's not meaningfully new in that way,

954
00:57:46,825 --> 00:57:50,485
Speaker 5:  except some more controls have been integrated into CarPlay

955
00:57:51,025 --> 00:57:54,965
Speaker 5:  and because of punch through ui you can push a button and like adjust the

956
00:57:54,965 --> 00:57:58,925
Speaker 5:  fancy speaker system using the native interface of the car

957
00:57:59,045 --> 00:58:02,965
Speaker 5:  maker. But that, that was a click away before. Right. It, it

958
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:06,325
Speaker 5:  wasn't that, it was just like functionally it's not that much more different.

959
00:58:06,495 --> 00:58:07,645
Speaker 5:  Right. At all.

960
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:11,805
Speaker 6:  If Apple had announced that in 2022, it probably would've shipped in 2022.

961
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:15,885
Speaker 6:  Do you know what I mean? Like Yeah. If if it had just explained it that

962
00:58:15,885 --> 00:58:18,725
Speaker 6:  way, the way that you just explained it, all the automakers on that slide

963
00:58:18,725 --> 00:58:21,445
Speaker 6:  would've been like, yeah, sure, fine. Whatever you wanna, you wanna let it

964
00:58:21,445 --> 00:58:24,445
Speaker 6:  show Apple Maps between this speedometer and the tecom while you're driving?

965
00:58:24,515 --> 00:58:25,405
Speaker 6:  Sure. Great. Fine.

966
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:28,765
Speaker 5:  But and they did because the original CarPlay, which by the way will continue.

967
00:58:28,915 --> 00:58:31,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They're just gonna keep making regular CarPlay. This is CarPlay Ultra

968
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:36,325
Speaker 5:  that is going to continue where you still get mirroring of maps

969
00:58:36,715 --> 00:58:40,205
Speaker 5:  onto the, the center cluster. And lots of cars have that. And in fact,

970
00:58:40,615 --> 00:58:43,765
Speaker 5:  every time another car is launched with it, people have been confused

971
00:58:44,155 --> 00:58:47,805
Speaker 5:  because they assume that that is next generation CarPlay. Yeah. And we have

972
00:58:47,805 --> 00:58:51,765
Speaker 5:  run story after story being like, no, that's just regular CarPlay. Next

973
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:55,685
Speaker 5:  Gen CarPlay is when your phone begins to

974
00:58:55,755 --> 00:58:59,605
Speaker 5:  operate more like the interface of the car directly, like all of the

975
00:58:59,605 --> 00:59:03,205
Speaker 5:  screens directly in this weird hybrid fashion are

976
00:59:03,485 --> 00:59:06,045
Speaker 5:  operated by with Apple design products that come from your phone.

977
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:08,325
Speaker 6:  Right. The idea was that you should be able to control the temperature of

978
00:59:08,385 --> 00:59:10,445
Speaker 6:  the cabin through CarPlay.

979
00:59:10,735 --> 00:59:13,325
Speaker 5:  Right. And so that, so that's one that's really interesting. Right? If you

980
00:59:13,325 --> 00:59:17,165
Speaker 5:  look at Apple's own designs of what an HVAC screen should look like, it's

981
00:59:17,165 --> 00:59:20,885
Speaker 5:  not some beautiful Johnny Ive reinvention of an HVAC

982
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,285
Speaker 5:  screen. It's not Steve Jobs showing all the old smartphones and mean like

983
00:59:24,285 --> 00:59:27,405
Speaker 5:  here's why they suck. Like here's the new I it's just an HVAC screen.

984
00:59:27,685 --> 00:59:27,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

985
00:59:28,355 --> 00:59:31,805
Speaker 5:  Like it down to like the weird sliders and the sync button for the multiple

986
00:59:31,805 --> 00:59:35,405
Speaker 5:  zones that like every car maker has, like they didn't actually do it. Right.

987
00:59:36,275 --> 00:59:40,255
Speaker 5:  It it is just Apple design riff on a very

988
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:44,375
Speaker 5:  standard HVAC screen. So if you're a car maker, I, when, when

989
00:59:44,395 --> 00:59:48,295
Speaker 5:  as these cars come out, I would say the HVAC screen is the thing to

990
00:59:48,295 --> 00:59:51,935
Speaker 5:  look at to see how important this is. Because if the car makers give that

991
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:55,655
Speaker 5:  to Apple, then they think there's some value there. If they do the punch

992
00:59:55,655 --> 00:59:59,375
Speaker 5:  through UI where they just show their own HVAC

993
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:03,135
Speaker 5:  screen, you will know they do not give a shit. Yeah. That this is just another

994
01:00:03,135 --> 01:00:06,695
Speaker 5:  feature on the spec sheet. Every car YouTube review that I've ever watched

995
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:10,415
Speaker 5:  that literally, whoever, it doesn't matter who, it's Doug DeMiro Forests

996
01:00:10,685 --> 01:00:13,695
Speaker 5:  Marquez on the auto focus channel, they wave at the center screen and like

997
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:17,615
Speaker 5:  it has CarPlay Android Auto and they just move on 'cause they don't care.

998
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:18,335
Speaker 6:  Yep.

999
01:00:18,945 --> 01:00:22,535
Speaker 5:  Right. And like, that's how you will know that this thing matters or doesn't

1000
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,895
Speaker 5:  matter if everyone just punches through their own HVAC controls.

1001
01:00:25,195 --> 01:00:29,125
Speaker 6:  But the other thing that has happened is we've gone back to buttons

1002
01:00:29,315 --> 01:00:32,365
Speaker 6:  like, again, rewind three years ago. And there was this idea that actually

1003
01:00:32,365 --> 01:00:36,285
Speaker 6:  what we want is a car cabin full of screens. And

1004
01:00:36,745 --> 01:00:40,605
Speaker 6:  overwhelmingly customers told car companies, no, you know, what I

1005
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:44,365
Speaker 6:  want is buttons. I want to, I want to be able to feel the temperature

1006
01:00:44,365 --> 01:00:47,285
Speaker 6:  control so that I don't have to look for it while I'm driving down the highway.

1007
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:51,405
Speaker 6:  And like company after company has gone back to saying, okay, we're gonna

1008
01:00:51,605 --> 01:00:54,565
Speaker 6:  actually have physical controls in the car. And I

1009
01:00:54,725 --> 01:00:57,005
Speaker 5:  Think there's one other thing driving that I, I agree. Buttons are great.

1010
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,235
Speaker 5:  Buy a car with buttons, you know, send the signal in the market that, you

1011
01:01:01,235 --> 01:01:02,315
Speaker 5:  know, be the hero America needs.

1012
01:01:04,115 --> 01:01:07,295
Speaker 5:  But also a bunch of these car makers put in all these screens and they realized

1013
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:11,215
Speaker 5:  they had no idea what to do with them. Right. Like sure at all. Even

1014
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:14,735
Speaker 5:  that CarPlay, that first CarPlay made from 2022, it has like five

1015
01:01:15,015 --> 01:01:18,055
Speaker 5:  calendars on it because they just didn't know what to fill the pixels with.

1016
01:01:18,055 --> 01:01:21,735
Speaker 5:  Right. They're like another clock widget that'll do it. And, and you know,

1017
01:01:21,735 --> 01:01:24,855
Speaker 5:  the thinking is like some applications will be developed to fill these screens

1018
01:01:25,075 --> 01:01:27,415
Speaker 5:  and there's nothing You're so Right. It

1019
01:01:27,415 --> 01:01:31,335
Speaker 6:  Has a, it has a, it has a music widget that is just like the progress

1020
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:35,335
Speaker 6:  bar of the song that is, it's gotta be three feet wide. Yeah. It's

1021
01:01:35,335 --> 01:01:39,135
Speaker 5:  Incredible. Yeah. You know, we have a passenger screen

1022
01:01:39,235 --> 01:01:42,575
Speaker 5:  in our Grand Cherokee. We've never turned it on. I have all the, I had all

1023
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:45,535
Speaker 5:  these dreams that Becky would like drive me around. I watch like watch football

1024
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:49,015
Speaker 5:  on the passenger screen and it's like five HDMI dongles later and like,

1025
01:01:49,245 --> 01:01:52,175
Speaker 5:  nope, I'm just gonna watch it on my phone. Which is almost as big as the

1026
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,615
Speaker 5:  screen. I test drove a Cadillac Vista

1027
01:01:56,075 --> 01:01:59,015
Speaker 5:  for a weekend. It's great. It's their new three row electric ev I'm gonna

1028
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:02,615
Speaker 5:  write about it. It it's great. It's a great car. It has huge screen in it.

1029
01:02:03,165 --> 01:02:07,095
Speaker 5:  Like one of those big curvy Cadillac ods. And I was just like, what is all

1030
01:02:07,095 --> 01:02:10,935
Speaker 5:  this? What, what do you, I I have three maps open right now. I have

1031
01:02:10,975 --> 01:02:14,785
Speaker 5:  a three foot podcast time elapse slider. Like what

1032
01:02:14,785 --> 01:02:18,665
Speaker 5:  is this for the, the new Escalate iq, which

1033
01:02:18,665 --> 01:02:22,565
Speaker 5:  is even bigger and has even more screens. You're like, oh, this is, it's

1034
01:02:22,565 --> 01:02:23,685
Speaker 5:  10, it's 10 maps.

1035
01:02:25,595 --> 01:02:29,405
Speaker 5:  Like maybe, maybe like three different Mac applications. Like why not Let's

1036
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:32,685
Speaker 5:  let's have a good time. And I think they realized the utility of these screens

1037
01:02:33,145 --> 01:02:36,125
Speaker 5:  was dropping. Like there was no nothing to use them for. Really.

1038
01:02:36,905 --> 01:02:40,325
Speaker 5:  People weren't using apps and shopping on them and then the customers were

1039
01:02:40,325 --> 01:02:43,755
Speaker 5:  like, we hate touching these screens. Yep. And

1040
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:47,755
Speaker 5:  yeah, I think Apple got caught into that like, larger trend, but I also think

1041
01:02:47,755 --> 01:02:51,735
Speaker 5:  they, they just oversold what they were trying to do and all the car makers,

1042
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:53,455
Speaker 5:  like, why would we give you our customers this way?

1043
01:02:54,155 --> 01:02:57,135
Speaker 6:  And all the customers were like, I don't care about any of this. Yeah.

1044
01:02:57,915 --> 01:03:01,575
Speaker 5:  And we still get a lot of notes whenever we cover a CarPlay. I'm not a CarPlay

1045
01:03:01,635 --> 01:03:05,535
Speaker 5:  fan. I, we, we use it in our older cars. I bought a

1046
01:03:05,635 --> 01:03:09,365
Speaker 5:  box, I've, I have this like 2016 Mercedes C

1047
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:13,165
Speaker 5:  43. It does not have any like, it's the worst screen in the world. And I

1048
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:16,925
Speaker 5:  bought a box. I literally had the radio and I bought a box that

1049
01:03:17,075 --> 01:03:20,645
Speaker 5:  sits, you plug the radio into the box and the box into the screen and it

1050
01:03:20,645 --> 01:03:24,045
Speaker 5:  hijacks the screen to put CarPlay on it. That's great. That's, it's like

1051
01:03:24,045 --> 01:03:27,885
Speaker 5:  I upgraded, it's a total hack and that's like fine. Right?

1052
01:03:27,995 --> 01:03:31,195
Speaker 5:  Sure. But we don't use it in our cars that are good.

1053
01:03:32,745 --> 01:03:36,635
Speaker 5:  Like my not garbage cars. We like, don't use this thing. And I, there's a

1054
01:03:36,635 --> 01:03:40,435
Speaker 5:  lot of reasons for that and kind of the number one is CarPlay is a

1055
01:03:40,435 --> 01:03:44,375
Speaker 5:  single application interface. You can get widgets, right?

1056
01:03:44,435 --> 01:03:47,655
Speaker 5:  So you can have a, a music player and the map open at the same time, but

1057
01:03:47,655 --> 01:03:51,315
Speaker 5:  they're both widgets. They're not actually the apps. Right. And what we want

1058
01:03:51,315 --> 01:03:54,075
Speaker 5:  is the map open and the music player open so you can like screw with it.

1059
01:03:54,075 --> 01:03:57,915
Speaker 5:  So we just mount a film like everyone does. And I, this doesn't solve that

1060
01:03:57,915 --> 01:03:58,595
Speaker 5:  core problem. Hold

1061
01:03:58,595 --> 01:04:02,555
Speaker 6:  On, hold on. Statistically everyone uses CarPlay.

1062
01:04:03,705 --> 01:04:07,695
Speaker 5:  This is not true. It's not true. Lots and lots

1063
01:04:07,695 --> 01:04:10,535
Speaker 5:  of people. This is now I'm just gonna issue bug requests to Apple.

1064
01:04:11,965 --> 01:04:15,775
Speaker 5:  This what is the show for? So if you look right now in like various support

1065
01:04:15,835 --> 01:04:19,615
Speaker 5:  forums, they just changed CarPlay so that no matter

1066
01:04:19,645 --> 01:04:23,495
Speaker 5:  what you're doing on your phone, it happens in CarPlay. And

1067
01:04:23,635 --> 01:04:26,335
Speaker 5:  the thing that a lot of people had figured out was you could take Google

1068
01:04:26,565 --> 01:04:30,385
Speaker 5:  Maps out of CarPlay, you can open a CarPlay preferences

1069
01:04:30,485 --> 01:04:34,465
Speaker 5:  on your phone and you can take Google Maps out. Oh sure. Or you

1070
01:04:34,465 --> 01:04:37,145
Speaker 5:  just hit the minus button. So then you have Google Maps open on your phone

1071
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:40,705
Speaker 5:  and your music or podcast or whatever running on CarPlay, which was the number

1072
01:04:40,765 --> 01:04:44,505
Speaker 5:  one use of CarPlay. When we hear from listeners or readers about why they

1073
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:48,265
Speaker 5:  like CarPlay, it's, I have 45 audio apps. Yep.

1074
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:52,545
Speaker 5:  Right. I have, I have whatever ebook reader I'm doing. I have not my podcast

1075
01:04:52,695 --> 01:04:55,625
Speaker 5:  apps. Like it's, they're all perfect. I don't wanna mess with them. I don't

1076
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:58,745
Speaker 5:  wanna log into GM's weird Android instance. Like I just wanna use my apps.

1077
01:04:58,745 --> 01:05:01,185
Speaker 5:  They've curated on my phone. They all have CarPlay. They go on that screen.

1078
01:05:01,185 --> 01:05:05,145
Speaker 5:  That's fine. And then a lot of people were taking Google Maps out so they

1079
01:05:05,145 --> 01:05:08,145
Speaker 5:  could basically have two monitors. Yeah. And they would mount the phone with

1080
01:05:08,145 --> 01:05:12,025
Speaker 5:  Google Maps and they would've the music on CarPlay and Apple broke

1081
01:05:12,025 --> 01:05:15,985
Speaker 5:  it. Interesting. So you can take Google Maps out and then

1082
01:05:15,985 --> 01:05:19,845
Speaker 5:  the phone is still like, no, we're sending this to CarPlay. And there's like

1083
01:05:19,845 --> 01:05:23,725
Speaker 5:  furious forum posts about it because that's how a lot of people

1084
01:05:23,725 --> 01:05:27,285
Speaker 5:  were still using that to have two different screens at once. Sure. Yeah.

1085
01:05:27,285 --> 01:05:30,125
Speaker 5:  Including me, and I'm very annoyed about this. I'm just complaining about

1086
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,685
Speaker 5:  my almost 10-year-old card that gets me nowhere with anyone.

1087
01:05:34,145 --> 01:05:37,605
Speaker 5:  But like there's, there's something there that's really powerful that next

1088
01:05:37,605 --> 01:05:41,255
Speaker 5:  generation CarPlay doesn't solve, but that even like GM's like crazy,

1089
01:05:41,325 --> 01:05:45,295
Speaker 5:  like giant curved screen kind of solves. 'cause you can put Google

1090
01:05:45,445 --> 01:05:49,005
Speaker 5:  Maps in the cluster and it's just Google Maps and then you can

1091
01:05:49,435 --> 01:05:51,725
Speaker 5:  have the music player and it's really big and it's like, oh, with all the

1092
01:05:51,725 --> 01:05:55,085
Speaker 5:  screen you should just let me run two apps at once. And they haven't quite

1093
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:56,285
Speaker 5:  gotten there. Maybe they will one

1094
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,045
Speaker 6:  Day. I mean this is, this is from the company that makes the iPad. Are you,

1095
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:00,165
Speaker 6:  are you shocked by this fact?

1096
01:06:01,935 --> 01:06:04,885
Speaker 5:  Again, it's like your point about buttons is there, but it's like, oh man,

1097
01:06:04,885 --> 01:06:06,965
Speaker 5:  they put in all these screens in the car and they forgot to build any apps

1098
01:06:06,965 --> 01:06:10,295
Speaker 5:  for them and they forgot the number one. Like why do people have three monitors?

1099
01:06:10,645 --> 01:06:12,295
Speaker 5:  It's not to run one big app

1100
01:06:15,955 --> 01:06:19,765
Speaker 5:  like you wanna run. Like that's why you want lots of windows. Like,

1101
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:24,405
Speaker 6:  We'll see, I want three linear feet of one app in my car.

1102
01:06:24,565 --> 01:06:28,245
Speaker 5:  I just wanna call one thing out. Apple gave one publication early

1103
01:06:28,245 --> 01:06:32,045
Speaker 5:  Hands-on with Car Play. I believe it was Top Gear. We embedded

1104
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:35,525
Speaker 5:  the video. Top Cruise. You could watch it. It's great. Almost everything

1105
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:39,285
Speaker 5:  is our reporting like down to like Mercedes CO

1106
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:42,925
Speaker 5:  Laia said he wouldn't use That's us. That's decoder. And then the explanation

1107
01:06:42,925 --> 01:06:45,205
Speaker 5:  of that video of like how it works, that's a, that's us. We, we wrote that

1108
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:48,975
Speaker 5:  story again. When you just ask Google about our play, it's like Neela hates

1109
01:06:48,975 --> 01:06:50,175
Speaker 5:  it. Like, it's like very fun.

1110
01:06:51,985 --> 01:06:55,265
Speaker 5:  So we're gonna get our own hands on soon. I'm excited to play with it.

1111
01:06:55,765 --> 01:06:58,505
Speaker 5:  Wwc is coming up around the corner. Very interesting. They announced this

1112
01:06:58,505 --> 01:07:02,065
Speaker 5:  weeks before wwc. The, in another world, this is a highlight

1113
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:05,865
Speaker 5:  announcement, right. And there's an Aston Martin sitting there and everyone

1114
01:07:05,865 --> 01:07:09,345
Speaker 5:  like does hands on the Aston Martin, but they announced it early. You wonder

1115
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:12,545
Speaker 5:  if they're gonna have more WC or if this was a distraction from them. All

1116
01:07:12,545 --> 01:07:14,905
Speaker 5:  right, I can continue complaining about CarPlay.

1117
01:07:15,275 --> 01:07:15,785
Speaker 6:  Let's not,

1118
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:17,865
Speaker 5:  Are you sure I got another 20 minutes? I mean

1119
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:19,185
Speaker 6:  That's what decoder

1120
01:07:19,185 --> 01:07:20,505
Speaker 5:  Is for. That's true.

1121
01:07:22,465 --> 01:07:25,645
Speaker 5:  Go watch the No literally no shade the top Gear people. It just, it was just

1122
01:07:25,645 --> 01:07:27,565
Speaker 5:  very funny. I was like, it's a good video. Watching this video. I was like,

1123
01:07:27,565 --> 01:07:29,605
Speaker 5:  oh, that's just, that's that's source test. Again, there

1124
01:07:29,605 --> 01:07:32,925
Speaker 6:  Was one thing in that video that I really appreciated, which is that he too

1125
01:07:32,945 --> 01:07:36,805
Speaker 6:  is confused about when it's Wired CarPlay and when it's wireless CarPlay

1126
01:07:36,835 --> 01:07:40,365
Speaker 6:  because he, he plugged it into his car and it launched the thing that said

1127
01:07:40,385 --> 01:07:43,725
Speaker 6:  set up wireless CarPlay. And it's like, which one, what, which one did I

1128
01:07:43,725 --> 01:07:47,565
Speaker 6:  do here? Which is a feeling that I have constantly all the time

1129
01:07:47,675 --> 01:07:48,165
Speaker 6:  driving

1130
01:07:48,165 --> 01:07:51,765
Speaker 5:  Around next the CarPlay Ultra is only wireless. That plugin is just the initial

1131
01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:55,965
Speaker 5:  download of assets. So you plug in your phone, I see the phone is like, I've

1132
01:07:55,965 --> 01:07:59,645
Speaker 5:  got a library of assets for car makers that Apple is designed with everybody.

1133
01:07:59,815 --> 01:08:03,165
Speaker 5:  We're gonna da we're gonna go update the, the database of assets and then

1134
01:08:03,405 --> 01:08:04,325
Speaker 5:  download the right ones to your car.

1135
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:09,225
Speaker 6:  I so fundamentally do not believe in the idea

1136
01:08:09,225 --> 01:08:12,665
Speaker 6:  that I should have to have an iPhone in order for my car to work properly.

1137
01:08:13,835 --> 01:08:16,930
Speaker 6:  Like you're just, that's this is, this is the problem with CarPlay Ultra

1138
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:20,845
Speaker 6:  that I have always had is that does not make sense to

1139
01:08:20,845 --> 01:08:24,325
Speaker 6:  me. The fact that my car is somehow not feature complete unless I own an

1140
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:27,885
Speaker 6:  iPhone is just backwards. Like this

1141
01:08:27,885 --> 01:08:30,125
Speaker 5:  Is the other thing that's that why is Apple it they

1142
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:33,005
Speaker 7:  Could, they could just throw in an iPhone for the cost of an Aston Martin.

1143
01:08:33,525 --> 01:08:34,125
Speaker 7:  I, that's

1144
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:37,565
Speaker 6:  Not a huge, honestly, like I I, anyone who buys an Aston Martin can afford

1145
01:08:37,565 --> 01:08:41,165
Speaker 6:  several iPhones. Like it's, it's a, it's a principle thing for me. Like my,

1146
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:45,475
Speaker 6:  my phone and my car should

1147
01:08:45,575 --> 01:08:49,475
Speaker 6:  not require each other to have a complete experience. I'm fine if one

1148
01:08:49,475 --> 01:08:53,315
Speaker 6:  wants to add to the other like Sure, okay. And

1149
01:08:53,315 --> 01:08:55,795
Speaker 6:  CarPlay and Android Auto are like interesting competitive experiences or

1150
01:08:55,835 --> 01:08:58,675
Speaker 6:  whatever. But if, if my car is not feature complete without my phone,

1151
01:08:59,615 --> 01:09:01,555
Speaker 6:  we have done something wrong as a society.

1152
01:09:01,945 --> 01:09:05,795
Speaker 7:  Fundamentally. I I agree with you and you're correct. As somebody who primarily

1153
01:09:05,795 --> 01:09:09,675
Speaker 7:  experiences cars via rentals, it, it drives

1154
01:09:09,735 --> 01:09:13,715
Speaker 7:  me crazy when it has a baked in thing. I just,

1155
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:16,595
Speaker 7:  right. My phone has everything on it. It's fully up to date, it has all my

1156
01:09:16,595 --> 01:09:20,435
Speaker 7:  preferences. Boom, plug it in. Easy done. I am like, I find

1157
01:09:20,435 --> 01:09:24,195
Speaker 7:  that to be just delightful. Sure. It, you, you are correct

1158
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:26,155
Speaker 7:  that a car should function.

1159
01:09:27,085 --> 01:09:30,995
Speaker 5:  David, I can get you in a 2008 DB nine for 17 five tonight

1160
01:09:33,415 --> 01:09:36,595
Speaker 6:  And then I can buy the CarPlay screen on TikTok and we're good to go.

1161
01:09:37,105 --> 01:09:37,635
Speaker 7:  That So

1162
01:09:37,775 --> 01:09:38,955
Speaker 6:  I'm cooking. Yeah.

1163
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:42,795
Speaker 5:  All right. Just in honor of the fact thats has, I'm gonna quickly shop for

1164
01:09:43,115 --> 01:09:45,955
Speaker 5:  Cadillac Escalades while David moves on to whatever's next.

1165
01:09:46,755 --> 01:09:49,595
Speaker 6:  We should talk about the Android announcements just for a couple of minutes

1166
01:09:49,595 --> 01:09:52,875
Speaker 6:  here. So Google io is next week

1167
01:09:54,175 --> 01:09:57,155
Speaker 6:  and I think Google just has a lot of other

1168
01:09:58,175 --> 01:10:01,595
Speaker 6:  AI stuff to talk about. So they just did all the Android stuff early.

1169
01:10:03,035 --> 01:10:06,885
Speaker 6:  They announced a bunch of new stuff for Android 16, including a

1170
01:10:06,885 --> 01:10:10,565
Speaker 6:  whole new design language that they call Material three expressive, which

1171
01:10:10,565 --> 01:10:14,125
Speaker 6:  is a stupid name for what I think is actually like a very cool yeah. Looking

1172
01:10:14,175 --> 01:10:17,845
Speaker 6:  thing. Like it's just really funny that looking at phones

1173
01:10:17,915 --> 01:10:21,085
Speaker 6:  have gotten, they've gotten so much more like sterile and

1174
01:10:22,045 --> 01:10:25,325
Speaker 6:  straightforward over time and Google is like, what it feels like playful

1175
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:29,165
Speaker 6:  and colorful and everything was purple and it's very Gen Z and I'm like

1176
01:10:29,165 --> 01:10:33,045
Speaker 6:  very cool and young. So it works for me too. And I just,

1177
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:35,845
Speaker 6:  I don't know. I like it. They're, they're making the animations more playful.

1178
01:10:35,995 --> 01:10:39,765
Speaker 6:  There's a lot more for developers to do in terms of like fonts and

1179
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:43,805
Speaker 6:  widgets and sizes and shapes of things and users can

1180
01:10:43,965 --> 01:10:47,525
Speaker 6:  customize it a lot. And I've given material

1181
01:10:47,845 --> 01:10:51,165
Speaker 6:  u kind of a hard time over the years because it was just like, oh, your wallpaper

1182
01:10:51,165 --> 01:10:54,805
Speaker 6:  has some brown in it. What if everything was brown? But there's something

1183
01:10:54,805 --> 01:10:58,565
Speaker 6:  about this and the idea that actually, yeah, I should be able to make everything

1184
01:10:58,635 --> 01:11:02,445
Speaker 6:  look the way that I want instead of just apple's weird idea

1185
01:11:02,445 --> 01:11:06,325
Speaker 6:  about tinting that I've come to really like, and I think Google is like

1186
01:11:06,325 --> 01:11:07,045
Speaker 6:  onto something here.

1187
01:11:07,395 --> 01:11:11,245
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I, the new design is really fun. I am a little skeptical

1188
01:11:11,425 --> 01:11:15,405
Speaker 7:  of the implementation material. U it it, it is

1189
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:19,005
Speaker 7:  not a big jump from Material U right? It it is fundamentally the same thing

1190
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:22,925
Speaker 7:  just made a little bit wackier. Yeah. And if you use lots

1191
01:11:22,925 --> 01:11:24,125
Speaker 7:  of different things on an Android phone,

1192
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:29,495
Speaker 7:  you know, the, the implementation of Material U has

1193
01:11:29,675 --> 01:11:33,335
Speaker 7:  not changed I think basically at all since it was announced like four years

1194
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:37,095
Speaker 7:  ago. Right? Sure. It's the same five widgets. Right. And, and you still

1195
01:11:37,115 --> 01:11:41,015
Speaker 7:  see in the material three expressive whatever it is,

1196
01:11:42,035 --> 01:11:45,655
Speaker 7:  you know, demo slides that they're showing. It's the, it is the same weather

1197
01:11:45,655 --> 01:11:48,735
Speaker 7:  widget and the same clock widget that we saw four years ago. Right. Those

1198
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:52,455
Speaker 7:  are still on my home screen because those are the only widgets that

1199
01:11:52,455 --> 01:11:55,695
Speaker 7:  theme themselves properly. Right. Like true, I really want a step counter

1200
01:11:55,715 --> 01:11:59,535
Speaker 7:  widget, right? Google owns Fitbit, they have Google

1201
01:11:59,535 --> 01:12:02,295
Speaker 7:  Health or whatever it's called. Neither of those have a material

1202
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,895
Speaker 7:  expressive whatever widget. Right? A lot of apps now

1203
01:12:06,895 --> 01:12:10,815
Speaker 7:  do support the, the icon theming, which is great, but not all of them

1204
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:11,535
Speaker 7:  do. And

1205
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:14,575
Speaker 6:  There is something truly awful by the way, about when your home screen has

1206
01:12:14,575 --> 01:12:18,135
Speaker 6:  a bunch of apps that all fit the theme and then like two that haven't updated.

1207
01:12:18,515 --> 01:12:22,295
Speaker 6:  And it just, there's nothing that kills a vibe quite like the one app that

1208
01:12:22,695 --> 01:12:24,695
Speaker 6:  steadfastly refuses to play nice with the operating system.

1209
01:12:25,045 --> 01:12:28,935
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And I think like unlike on, and look a Apple has made some,

1210
01:12:28,975 --> 01:12:32,135
Speaker 7:  I think some errors with the way they have done theming, but I do think that

1211
01:12:32,275 --> 01:12:36,135
Speaker 7:  one thing Apple has to it its advantage is when they do something their

1212
01:12:36,135 --> 01:12:39,495
Speaker 7:  developers listen. And so when Apple changes the theme of its operating system,

1213
01:12:39,495 --> 01:12:43,455
Speaker 7:  which we may see next month, I suspect

1214
01:12:43,455 --> 01:12:47,135
Speaker 7:  you'll see a lot of apps developers, you know, moving

1215
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:50,695
Speaker 7:  forward to update and theme in that style to reflect what the operat system

1216
01:12:50,695 --> 01:12:54,575
Speaker 7:  is supposed to feel like. And I don't know, using Android apps that most

1217
01:12:54,595 --> 01:12:58,375
Speaker 7:  of them reflect the feeling of material you, or

1218
01:12:58,615 --> 01:13:02,335
Speaker 7:  material design or, you know, whatever's coming next Android feels different

1219
01:13:02,335 --> 01:13:06,255
Speaker 7:  and it's nice and I think it looks lovely and there are places when, where,

1220
01:13:06,795 --> 01:13:10,695
Speaker 7:  you know, those effects are able to be added into third party apps,

1221
01:13:10,695 --> 01:13:14,575
Speaker 7:  right? Like I see the little squiggly playback line on the Spotify

1222
01:13:15,795 --> 01:13:19,015
Speaker 7:  widget in the notification shade. It's great. It's nice. I I I wanna be clear,

1223
01:13:19,015 --> 01:13:22,215
Speaker 7:  like I think the design is really fun and I think the Android has become

1224
01:13:22,215 --> 01:13:26,055
Speaker 7:  sort of a, a, a, a much more like lively looking operating system in that

1225
01:13:26,055 --> 01:13:29,935
Speaker 7:  way than iOS. But I I I think like

1226
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:34,095
Speaker 7:  coming up with this big design refresh is step one

1227
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:37,855
Speaker 7:  and step two is following through with it. It is, it is having people make

1228
01:13:37,855 --> 01:13:41,215
Speaker 7:  widgets. It is having people support theming. And

1229
01:13:41,435 --> 01:13:45,415
Speaker 7:  Google did not do that with Material U and it is not clear

1230
01:13:45,415 --> 01:13:48,735
Speaker 7:  to me that they're, they have a push behind material three expressive either.

1231
01:13:49,035 --> 01:13:52,815
Speaker 7:  So that is where my skepticism is. And I, I'm, I hope,

1232
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:56,735
Speaker 7:  I hope that they're able to, you know, get some people on board with it.

1233
01:13:56,855 --> 01:14:00,375
Speaker 7:  'cause I, it would be really fun and delightful to have all my icons be the

1234
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:04,015
Speaker 7:  same color and have all these fun, you know, widgets. The

1235
01:14:04,015 --> 01:14:04,775
Speaker 6:  Bar is on the floor,

1236
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:06,215
Speaker 7:  Jake. Yeah. Yeah. All

1237
01:14:06,215 --> 01:14:07,415
Speaker 6:  My icons be the same color.

1238
01:14:07,585 --> 01:14:09,135
Speaker 7:  Right. It's not happening. This

1239
01:14:09,135 --> 01:14:13,005
Speaker 6:  To me is so indicative of how weirdly Google has started

1240
01:14:13,005 --> 01:14:16,405
Speaker 6:  to handle Android. Like for so long, Android had

1241
01:14:16,445 --> 01:14:20,405
Speaker 6:  versions that it launched that were a thing that like Google

1242
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:23,885
Speaker 6:  would do a bunch of updates to Android at once and be like, look, a new version

1243
01:14:23,885 --> 01:14:27,645
Speaker 6:  of Android, it had a dessert name like it, it was a thing. And that has just

1244
01:14:27,675 --> 01:14:31,445
Speaker 6:  stopped now. Like we don't even really

1245
01:14:31,505 --> 01:14:34,725
Speaker 6:  pay attention to new versions of Android anymore, which is like maybe a failing

1246
01:14:34,725 --> 01:14:36,925
Speaker 6:  of ours, but I think it's mostly a failing of Google's.

1247
01:14:36,985 --> 01:14:39,925
Speaker 7:  No, no, no. I mean this is the thing, a couple years back we were like, Hey,

1248
01:14:40,385 --> 01:14:44,285
Speaker 7:  we, we reached out to Google, we're like, Hey, did you guys say

1249
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:48,285
Speaker 7:  the word Android during this Google io keynote? And they're

1250
01:14:48,285 --> 01:14:51,805
Speaker 7:  like, yeah, you know, and like it, okay, we had, we had missed, but

1251
01:14:52,315 --> 01:14:55,925
Speaker 7:  they, they were specifically not mentioning Android version numbers because

1252
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:59,125
Speaker 7:  they want to blur it. They want it to just be like they're these iterative

1253
01:14:59,125 --> 01:14:59,965
Speaker 7:  things. Well,

1254
01:14:59,965 --> 01:15:03,885
Speaker 6:  And it's because it is such a disastrously fragmented Yes.

1255
01:15:03,975 --> 01:15:07,605
Speaker 6:  Thing that if, if they don't tell you what version number it is, you can't

1256
01:15:07,605 --> 01:15:11,525
Speaker 6:  put up the chart with how low the updates have been to that version number.

1257
01:15:11,525 --> 01:15:14,765
Speaker 6:  Right. And like Apple made such a meal out of it every year

1258
01:15:15,235 --> 01:15:18,645
Speaker 6:  showing all of the phones that had been updated to the new iOS versus all

1259
01:15:18,645 --> 01:15:21,285
Speaker 6:  of the phones that had been updated to the new Android. And it was always

1260
01:15:21,515 --> 01:15:25,405
Speaker 6:  ugly. And I think Google just rather than try to fight, just kind of

1261
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:28,085
Speaker 6:  gave up and decided to hide. And I think that is a bummer.

1262
01:15:28,085 --> 01:15:31,965
Speaker 5:  There is a back and forth there. Right? The cynical view, which

1263
01:15:32,745 --> 01:15:36,405
Speaker 5:  is correct, but cynical is that Google is largely

1264
01:15:37,035 --> 01:15:40,765
Speaker 5:  base operating system supplier to Samsung at least expressed in this country.

1265
01:15:40,915 --> 01:15:44,445
Speaker 5:  Sure. Samsung is all the Android market share. And it doesn't matter

1266
01:15:44,755 --> 01:15:48,725
Speaker 5:  what material three expressive is because Samsung's gonna put one UI

1267
01:15:48,725 --> 01:15:52,285
Speaker 5:  on top of Android and that, and that's what you get. Right. And all that

1268
01:15:52,285 --> 01:15:55,925
Speaker 5:  really matters is, does Google push security updates fast enough for the

1269
01:15:55,925 --> 01:15:59,605
Speaker 5:  people with Samsung phones as, as the operating system vendor? And the capabilities

1270
01:15:59,745 --> 01:16:03,685
Speaker 5:  of each successive operating system version are now

1271
01:16:03,755 --> 01:16:07,565
Speaker 5:  very small even in iOS world, right? Yeah. The, the, the

1272
01:16:07,565 --> 01:16:10,885
Speaker 5:  real differences between iOS 13 and 14 are, are nothing.

1273
01:16:12,105 --> 01:16:15,295
Speaker 5:  Right? It's nothing like, there's some stuff

1274
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:19,095
Speaker 5:  your phone will insist on summarizing your text messages, even if you turn

1275
01:16:19,095 --> 01:16:22,905
Speaker 5:  Apple intelligence off. That's a feature exists on iOS now.

1276
01:16:22,905 --> 01:16:26,545
Speaker 5:  But the, the sort of like incremental value to app developers to users

1277
01:16:27,285 --> 01:16:31,225
Speaker 5:  for successive operating system versions is just

1278
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:35,225
Speaker 5:  smaller and smaller every year. Yeah. Okay. So that's like the very cynical

1279
01:16:35,225 --> 01:16:38,625
Speaker 5:  view. Like Google has blurred these version numbers

1280
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:42,705
Speaker 5:  because really it just has to provide base Android to Samsung, which will

1281
01:16:42,705 --> 01:16:45,585
Speaker 5:  then do one UI stuff and it doesn't matter. 'cause the whole point of Android

1282
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,985
Speaker 5:  is search volume Sure. And now maybe

1283
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:53,425
Speaker 5:  Gemini queries, right? And there's a whole interest drop about that. The

1284
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:57,305
Speaker 5:  less cynical version of this is that actually creates freedom for

1285
01:16:57,345 --> 01:16:59,945
Speaker 5:  Google's design team to say it all looks different now,

1286
01:17:01,025 --> 01:17:04,575
Speaker 5:  right? We're, we're, we're pushing the boundary of what Android can look

1287
01:17:04,575 --> 01:17:08,455
Speaker 5:  like and feel like with things like material three expressive. Because

1288
01:17:09,175 --> 01:17:12,235
Speaker 5:  no one will be mad at us when we change it because no one has it.

1289
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:17,325
Speaker 5:  Right? A bunch of pixel owners will be excited 'cause they signed up for

1290
01:17:17,325 --> 01:17:20,845
Speaker 5:  this. This is, this is why you buy a pixel at the end of the day,

1291
01:17:21,145 --> 01:17:24,365
Speaker 5:  is to get Google's vision of Android. So if we make it different, they'll

1292
01:17:24,365 --> 01:17:26,685
Speaker 5:  be excited 'cause they got something no one else has. And that will create

1293
01:17:26,925 --> 01:17:29,085
Speaker 5:  whatever exclusivity around the pixel. I don dunno if that actually works

1294
01:17:29,085 --> 01:17:32,165
Speaker 5:  out, but that's the argument you would make. That's like the less cynical

1295
01:17:32,325 --> 01:17:35,365
Speaker 5:  argument of like the opportunity that's created by the fact that Samsung

1296
01:17:35,505 --> 01:17:38,765
Speaker 5:  is the volume player in Android and Google can be like the very tip of the

1297
01:17:38,765 --> 01:17:42,005
Speaker 5:  spear. Has Google done a great job being the tip of the spear of the Android

1298
01:17:42,005 --> 01:17:45,955
Speaker 5:  ecosystem? It has not. No. And I think that's the opportunity they're missing.

1299
01:17:46,165 --> 01:17:46,515
Speaker 5:  Those

1300
01:17:46,515 --> 01:17:50,475
Speaker 6:  Can both be true at the same time, right? They, that is Google has, has

1301
01:17:51,065 --> 01:17:54,835
Speaker 6:  lost control of its destiny in that way. But it has,

1302
01:17:54,975 --> 01:17:58,955
Speaker 6:  it has moves it can do even as kind of a bit player in its own

1303
01:17:59,195 --> 01:18:02,675
Speaker 6:  universe. And that's, that's, that's so sad. I mean that's what it is.

1304
01:18:03,015 --> 01:18:06,795
Speaker 6:  But that's, and that's fine. But I think Jake to,

1305
01:18:06,855 --> 01:18:10,355
Speaker 6:  to your point, like the challenge for Google has been

1306
01:18:11,095 --> 01:18:14,435
Speaker 6:  to like propagate its good ideas. And I think

1307
01:18:14,865 --> 01:18:18,475
Speaker 6:  just pitting what, what Google launched this week next to all of the stuff

1308
01:18:18,475 --> 01:18:22,395
Speaker 6:  we've seen about what's coming from iOS, which is this like Vision Pro based

1309
01:18:23,005 --> 01:18:26,955
Speaker 6:  everything in sort of 3D space, even more like cold and

1310
01:18:27,155 --> 01:18:30,835
Speaker 6:  sterile in space Ag. Look, I'm vastly

1311
01:18:30,835 --> 01:18:34,195
Speaker 6:  prefer Android. Like the, the ideas about what your phone should look like,

1312
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,315
Speaker 6:  I, I resonate with what Google is up to so much more than what Apple is up

1313
01:18:38,315 --> 01:18:42,115
Speaker 6:  to. But un until,

1314
01:18:42,115 --> 01:18:45,915
Speaker 6:  and unless you get all at at least enough people to buy into this that

1315
01:18:45,915 --> 01:18:49,835
Speaker 6:  it feels coherent and good. It's gonna feel the way Android

1316
01:18:49,835 --> 01:18:53,635
Speaker 6:  always has, which is like a mishmash of a decade's worth of ideas. And that

1317
01:18:53,635 --> 01:18:57,595
Speaker 6:  feels bad. And so it's like the Google has always struggled to get

1318
01:18:57,595 --> 01:19:01,275
Speaker 6:  to that tipping point where it's like, okay, I actually understand

1319
01:19:01,345 --> 01:19:05,235
Speaker 6:  what this thing is trying to do and it feels consistent no matter where I

1320
01:19:05,235 --> 01:19:07,435
Speaker 6:  am. And Android never feels consistent.

1321
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:11,355
Speaker 7:  They have guaranteed that the home screen on pixel phones is gonna look really

1322
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:15,235
Speaker 7:  cool for the next three years. Yes. And and and I think it's very possibly

1323
01:19:15,235 --> 01:19:17,835
Speaker 7:  going to end there and I hope it doesn't, but, but that is what it is.

1324
01:19:18,145 --> 01:19:21,675
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no, I I think that's right. And it's, it's the thing Google is

1325
01:19:22,115 --> 01:19:26,075
Speaker 6:  invested in, in like a real way is making sure Gemini is

1326
01:19:26,075 --> 01:19:28,955
Speaker 6:  everywhere, right? And, and Google is fine if you don't take its aesthetic

1327
01:19:28,965 --> 01:19:32,795
Speaker 6:  ideas, but it is going to beat you up until you put Gemini

1328
01:19:32,795 --> 01:19:33,195
Speaker 6:  everywhere. Yes.

1329
01:19:33,255 --> 01:19:36,755
Speaker 5:  Or pay, pay you lots of money, which it's paying Samsung lots of money. Gemini,

1330
01:19:36,755 --> 01:19:37,595
Speaker 6:  It's gonna beat you up with dollars.

1331
01:19:38,555 --> 01:19:42,195
Speaker 5:  Just, just throw money at you. Yeah. Just Mr. Beast at the YouTube

1332
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:45,715
Speaker 5:  upfronts, Mia Sato was, was at the upfronts and she

1333
01:19:46,065 --> 01:19:49,155
Speaker 5:  said, Mr. Beast got on stage and says, no one tells you how heavy money is.

1334
01:19:49,155 --> 01:19:52,875
Speaker 5:  Which is a all time quote. 'cause he's, he's the one with

1335
01:19:53,035 --> 01:19:56,515
Speaker 5:  suitcases full of money. And that's Google, right? They're like, Samsung,

1336
01:19:56,515 --> 01:19:58,555
Speaker 5:  would you like to know how heavy this money is? Do

1337
01:19:58,555 --> 01:20:02,475
Speaker 6:  You think he understood the true like, emotional depth of that sentence?

1338
01:20:02,975 --> 01:20:05,755
Speaker 6:  No one understands how heavy money is. It's very good. He is like, wow. It's

1339
01:20:05,755 --> 01:20:05,835
Speaker 6:  very

1340
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:06,155
Speaker 5:  Good.

1341
01:20:08,175 --> 01:20:11,405
Speaker 5:  We'll see, I mean I, I'm excited for io I think we're, you know, from everything

1342
01:20:11,405 --> 01:20:15,125
Speaker 5:  we've heard, there's going to be a push towards, you know,

1343
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:18,685
Speaker 5:  Google's next set of platform ideas around ai, around mixed reality, around

1344
01:20:18,685 --> 01:20:22,565
Speaker 5:  all this stuff. I think that stuff will be exciting. It's weird 'cause material

1345
01:20:22,565 --> 01:20:25,605
Speaker 5:  three expressive, I mean, it's, it, it,

1346
01:20:26,095 --> 01:20:29,785
Speaker 5:  there's an argument that like skew morph, issm is coming back, right? These

1347
01:20:29,785 --> 01:20:33,225
Speaker 5:  like very tactile, very real feeling textures. And

1348
01:20:33,985 --> 01:20:36,905
Speaker 5:  I don't know how that plays with all of the other kinds of experiences that

1349
01:20:36,905 --> 01:20:39,625
Speaker 5:  all these companies wanna build. But you don't want a bunch of like leather

1350
01:20:39,645 --> 01:20:43,505
Speaker 5:  and felt in your AR classes. Like that's really weird. That's just super

1351
01:20:43,785 --> 01:20:47,225
Speaker 5:  goofy. And I think that's why Apple is headed towards this like sterile,

1352
01:20:47,335 --> 01:20:49,985
Speaker 5:  like literally it looks like aero glass from Windows back in the day. Right?

1353
01:20:50,265 --> 01:20:53,905
Speaker 5:  Like they're headed towards computer interfaces. 'cause if you want the real

1354
01:20:53,905 --> 01:20:57,665
Speaker 5:  world to come through your glasses, you want computers on top of it and

1355
01:20:57,665 --> 01:20:59,825
Speaker 5:  Google's in this other direction and we'll just see. I'm sure they have some

1356
01:20:59,825 --> 01:21:02,665
Speaker 5:  idea about how comes together. That's kind of what I'm interested to see

1357
01:21:02,665 --> 01:21:03,065
Speaker 5:  at io.

1358
01:21:03,695 --> 01:21:04,505
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Agreed.

1359
01:21:04,885 --> 01:21:06,545
Speaker 5:  All right. We should move on. There's like, wait,

1360
01:21:06,545 --> 01:21:10,345
Speaker 6:  Hold on. Before, before we move on, we just need to just

1361
01:21:10,435 --> 01:21:13,995
Speaker 6:  brief shout out to the public reemergence

1362
01:21:14,695 --> 01:21:18,395
Speaker 6:  of our good friend and former colleague Dieter Bone who was on

1363
01:21:18,405 --> 01:21:22,195
Speaker 6:  stage virtual stage, stage, quote unquote stage

1364
01:21:22,365 --> 01:21:25,435
Speaker 6:  doing stuff. And boy were people excited to see Dieter.

1365
01:21:25,435 --> 01:21:27,595
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Basically just doing phone hands ons. Yeah. He

1366
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:30,315
Speaker 6:  Just did phone hands ons. He just was he he remains Dieter.

1367
01:21:31,575 --> 01:21:32,075
Speaker 6:  It was nice.

1368
01:21:32,545 --> 01:21:34,955
Speaker 5:  He's and he was like the surprise treat at the end of the video. You should

1369
01:21:34,955 --> 01:21:37,475
Speaker 5:  go watch it. It's great. Yeah. But he is like, look, this one opens, that

1370
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:39,315
Speaker 5:  one closes. It's like very good.

1371
01:21:40,335 --> 01:21:44,075
Speaker 6:  Dieter still loves phones and I will forever love Dieter for loving

1372
01:21:44,075 --> 01:21:44,915
Speaker 6:  phones. Yeah.

1373
01:21:45,495 --> 01:21:49,275
Speaker 5:  I'm excited for io. Yeah. I I assume io this year, this is next

1374
01:21:49,275 --> 01:21:53,235
Speaker 5:  week is just gonna be Gemini talk like

1375
01:21:53,335 --> 01:21:56,355
Speaker 5:  top to bottom. Like here's everything we do better than chat GPT. Yep.

1376
01:21:56,825 --> 01:22:00,675
Speaker 6:  That is certainly the, the vibe that I'm getting from, from all

1377
01:22:00,675 --> 01:22:03,995
Speaker 6:  the, all the rumors and reporting so far is like, Google is

1378
01:22:04,715 --> 01:22:08,475
Speaker 6:  I think, clearer than ever about what it's about as a company.

1379
01:22:08,615 --> 01:22:12,435
Speaker 6:  And the thing that it is about is Gemini feel about that however

1380
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:16,355
Speaker 6:  you want. But Google is going to, the, the pivot to Gemini is very,

1381
01:22:16,355 --> 01:22:16,955
Speaker 6:  very real.

1382
01:22:17,345 --> 01:22:21,235
Speaker 5:  There's this got unearthed in the docs of one of the Google

1383
01:22:21,235 --> 01:22:24,755
Speaker 5:  trials internal notes from Google meetings

1384
01:22:25,145 --> 01:22:29,125
Speaker 5:  that they are thinking of redoing the entire search

1385
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:30,925
Speaker 5:  stack with an LLM as the base.

1386
01:22:31,585 --> 01:22:32,005
Speaker 6:  Oh wow.

1387
01:22:32,675 --> 01:22:36,485
Speaker 5:  This is a big deal. Like that's where we're at with Google and Gemini. Yeah.

1388
01:22:36,705 --> 01:22:40,365
Speaker 5:  So we're, we're gonna go there. I'll be there. Our team will be there.

1389
01:22:40,955 --> 01:22:43,805
Speaker 5:  Lots of interviews, lots of hands-on, lots of probing questions about

1390
01:22:44,705 --> 01:22:48,245
Speaker 5:  wither the web. That's my job at Google. A I just walk around and be like,

1391
01:22:48,245 --> 01:22:48,845
Speaker 5:  what about the web?

1392
01:22:50,415 --> 01:22:51,245
Speaker 5:  We'll see how it goes.

1393
01:22:51,435 --> 01:22:51,885
Speaker 6:  Love this.

1394
01:22:52,555 --> 01:22:56,005
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be great. All right. We gotta take a break. We'll be back with

1395
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:56,565
Speaker 5:  the lightning round.

1396
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:34,205
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. The lightning round unsponsored

1397
01:24:34,915 --> 01:24:38,655
Speaker 5:  for flavor. Can I actually, can I, can I, can we do a digression

1398
01:24:38,945 --> 01:24:42,785
Speaker 5:  about sponsorship and flavor? Sure. I have a lot to say

1399
01:24:42,785 --> 01:24:46,625
Speaker 5:  about what's going on in the world of advertising. I always say the, the,

1400
01:24:46,735 --> 01:24:50,465
Speaker 5:  that we're unsponsored for flavor. 'cause I want people to, to think when

1401
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:53,585
Speaker 5:  they hear sponsor integrations, oh, there's, there's less flavor here.

1402
01:24:54,445 --> 01:24:58,155
Speaker 5:  You can't pay to tell us what to do. You can go read our ethics policy. Our

1403
01:24:58,155 --> 01:25:01,595
Speaker 5:  ethics policy is basically you can't tell me what to do, which, if you can

1404
01:25:01,595 --> 01:25:05,435
Speaker 5:  get into a line of work where the thing you're selling is the inability of

1405
01:25:05,435 --> 01:25:08,435
Speaker 5:  anyone to tell you what to do. Like I highly recommend it. I'm not saying

1406
01:25:08,435 --> 01:25:12,195
Speaker 5:  digital media is is a great or stable career, but one thing it does offer

1407
01:25:12,655 --> 01:25:15,875
Speaker 5:  is the ability to say, you cannot tell me what to do.

1408
01:25:16,915 --> 01:25:19,405
Speaker 5:  It's good. That's what I like about it. And that's what we sell here. That's

1409
01:25:19,805 --> 01:25:23,585
Speaker 5:  subscribe to The Verge. That's, that's what you're buying from us. Everything

1410
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:27,025
Speaker 5:  else is turning into the worst kind of

1411
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:30,705
Speaker 5:  marketing integrated sponsorship that I can possibly think of. Yeah. And

1412
01:25:30,705 --> 01:25:34,225
Speaker 5:  it's like everywhere now. So we are talking about Warner Bros. Discovery

1413
01:25:34,345 --> 01:25:38,305
Speaker 5:  Upfronts and all these media companies are having them. Warner Bros launched

1414
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:42,305
Speaker 5:  story verse this week where you can just

1415
01:25:42,645 --> 01:25:46,545
Speaker 5:  buy their like IP library and make ads out of it.

1416
01:25:46,945 --> 01:25:47,465
Speaker 5:  I hate this

1417
01:25:47,565 --> 01:25:48,065
Speaker 13:  So much.

1418
01:25:48,535 --> 01:25:51,785
Speaker 5:  Like, you know, they did Batman versus Batman. That's part of story verse

1419
01:25:51,835 --> 01:25:55,465
Speaker 5:  where like, state Farms showed up and they're like, we'd like to buy some

1420
01:25:55,465 --> 01:25:58,185
Speaker 5:  Batman stuff. And Warner Bros was like, yeah, you can make ads outta this.

1421
01:25:58,525 --> 01:26:02,305
Speaker 5:  That's what this is for. It's to turn it into advertising. And now they've,

1422
01:26:02,305 --> 01:26:04,845
Speaker 5:  they've done a couple of these pilots, and I'm not saying these ads were

1423
01:26:04,845 --> 01:26:08,435
Speaker 5:  bad, but like their business model is now we make this

1424
01:26:08,695 --> 01:26:12,355
Speaker 5:  IP and you can show up and turn whatever is in our catalog into

1425
01:26:12,635 --> 01:26:12,915
Speaker 5:  advertising.

1426
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:17,465
Speaker 7:  This is the thing that makes the most sense of all of the zaz love

1427
01:26:17,465 --> 01:26:21,265
Speaker 7:  actions, right? Like it all comes back to this, right? Like, oh, we

1428
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:24,785
Speaker 7:  have things that people like that we can ring more money out of.

1429
01:26:25,255 --> 01:26:27,945
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And you know, it's funny, they announced this name

1430
01:26:27,945 --> 01:26:31,545
Speaker 5:  change and we were looking at all their press releases and Emma, who like

1431
01:26:31,565 --> 01:26:35,225
Speaker 5:  was covering this, I was like, the actual story here is this ad product,

1432
01:26:35,845 --> 01:26:39,635
Speaker 5:  right? Where their catalog, the whole Warner Bros catalog is now

1433
01:26:39,665 --> 01:26:43,275
Speaker 5:  able, like it's for sale to be remixed into advertising.

1434
01:26:43,385 --> 01:26:45,115
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's what it's for.

1435
01:26:45,565 --> 01:26:49,475
Speaker 6:  We're so few steps away from, and we've uploaded a bunch of assets

1436
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:52,835
Speaker 6:  for you to use generative AI to just make ads against, it's right, it's right

1437
01:26:52,835 --> 01:26:54,795
Speaker 6:  there. Put this right next to Mark Zuckerberg's thing that he was talking

1438
01:26:54,795 --> 01:26:57,875
Speaker 6:  about where he's like, we're gonna let you make AI ads. And it's like, we're

1439
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:01,035
Speaker 6:  gonna let you make AI Batman ads is like, it's just right there.

1440
01:27:01,335 --> 01:27:04,395
Speaker 5:  And, and it's right there. It's, it's been there in the background of all

1441
01:27:04,395 --> 01:27:05,555
Speaker 5:  these companies for a long time. So

1442
01:27:07,075 --> 01:27:09,195
Speaker 5:  NBCU, Comcast, our favorites,

1443
01:27:11,085 --> 01:27:14,995
Speaker 5:  their sponsors for SNL 50 this season were getting sketches on

1444
01:27:15,015 --> 01:27:18,675
Speaker 5:  air, right? So like Maybelline oh was a big sponsor and they did a bunch

1445
01:27:18,675 --> 01:27:22,635
Speaker 5:  of stuff with the cast and VW was a big sponsor and every episode of

1446
01:27:22,795 --> 01:27:26,595
Speaker 5:  SNL had that sketch. The Californians. Yep. But it was just a VW

1447
01:27:26,655 --> 01:27:30,435
Speaker 5:  but that was marked as advertising. You know that Sketch, the Jennifer Coolidge

1448
01:27:30,455 --> 01:27:34,395
Speaker 5:  or Anna Grande? Everyone's Jennifer Coolidge sketch. Yep. I think Dana Carby

1449
01:27:34,395 --> 01:27:38,315
Speaker 5:  was in it. Maybelline Maybelline is a title sponsor of

1450
01:27:38,435 --> 01:27:41,555
Speaker 5:  SNL 50 and they got a sketch on air. Oh wow. They went viral 'cause it was

1451
01:27:41,555 --> 01:27:45,195
Speaker 5:  very funny. But that's just integrated brand advertising. And what is that

1452
01:27:45,195 --> 01:27:47,395
Speaker 5:  sketch? It's just all sing Maybelline 50 times over.

1453
01:27:49,315 --> 01:27:53,005
Speaker 5:  Like what? And that's like, whatever. It's a comedy show. Fine. Integrate

1454
01:27:53,005 --> 01:27:56,285
Speaker 5:  the brands. It's product placement all you want. Okay, here's the last one.

1455
01:27:57,085 --> 01:28:00,815
Speaker 5:  This one like drove me over the edge this week. There's a new

1456
01:28:01,135 --> 01:28:04,985
Speaker 5:  documentary F1 documentary on Netflix about Kimmy Antonelli

1457
01:28:05,005 --> 01:28:06,585
Speaker 5:  the new driver for Mercedes.

1458
01:28:08,275 --> 01:28:12,155
Speaker 5:  It is literally a WhatsApp commercial. Like when you open it

1459
01:28:12,155 --> 01:28:15,995
Speaker 5:  on Netflix, the interface, you know where it says like what the show is

1460
01:28:15,995 --> 01:28:18,835
Speaker 5:  about. The first words are

1461
01:28:19,425 --> 01:28:23,235
Speaker 5:  sponsored by WhatsApp. Ugh. It doesn't even tell you what it is. The,

1462
01:28:23,235 --> 01:28:26,715
Speaker 5:  like, literally the first things you see are sponsored by WhatsApp and then

1463
01:28:26,715 --> 01:28:29,515
Speaker 5:  it's like the story of Kim Manson taking over Louis Hamilton seat and the

1464
01:28:29,715 --> 01:28:33,675
Speaker 5:  Mercedes. And then you start the show and you know,

1465
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:36,835
Speaker 5:  it's just like a 40 minute documentary about like the 17-year-old kid getting

1466
01:28:36,835 --> 01:28:40,795
Speaker 5:  to drive a car. Like this is catnip for me. And

1467
01:28:40,795 --> 01:28:44,635
Speaker 5:  like in the title sequence, it's like presented by WhatsApp and then the,

1468
01:28:44,975 --> 01:28:48,835
Speaker 5:  the, the doc is tons and tons

1469
01:28:49,295 --> 01:28:53,035
Speaker 5:  of fake WhatsApp conversations and staged

1470
01:28:53,275 --> 01:28:54,115
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp video calls.

1471
01:28:54,415 --> 01:28:54,635
Speaker 6:  Oh

1472
01:28:54,635 --> 01:28:56,035
Speaker 7:  That's, oh that's really weird.

1473
01:28:56,365 --> 01:28:57,675
Speaker 5:  Right? So like everything

1474
01:28:57,675 --> 01:29:00,795
Speaker 6:  You said until that is like, I'm like fine, whatever. Like

1475
01:29:01,905 --> 01:29:04,045
Speaker 6:  get your money to make your documentary however you want

1476
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:09,085
Speaker 6:  Art and commerce Sure. Knock yourself out. But then, ugh.

1477
01:29:09,515 --> 01:29:13,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like Toto Wolf calls Kimmy Antonelli to tell him to take, you know,

1478
01:29:13,245 --> 01:29:16,605
Speaker 5:  he's getting the job. And the first words he said in that call

1479
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,365
Speaker 5:  are, we've set up this WhatsApp call.

1480
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:20,725
Speaker 6:  Oh my God.

1481
01:29:21,865 --> 01:29:25,365
Speaker 5:  Brutal. Also the video quality I call horrible, horrible advertising

1482
01:29:25,365 --> 01:29:25,845
Speaker 6:  For WhatsApp.

1483
01:29:26,665 --> 01:29:28,885
Speaker 5:  And they're like, you know, I I like posted on Blue Sky about this. And people

1484
01:29:28,885 --> 01:29:32,245
Speaker 5:  are like, you know, race cars are all about advertising and like Sure. You

1485
01:29:32,245 --> 01:29:35,725
Speaker 5:  know, the, the team speak button on the steering wheel in Mercedes is a WhatsApp

1486
01:29:35,795 --> 01:29:38,885
Speaker 5:  icon. 'cause they have a long fine whatever. Like get your bag. I don't care.

1487
01:29:39,265 --> 01:29:43,085
Speaker 5:  I'm just saying the actual content is advertising now. Yeah.

1488
01:29:43,435 --> 01:29:47,235
Speaker 5:  Like these things have collapsed. Like we are just viewing

1489
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:50,755
Speaker 5:  advertising to the point where the first line of the description of the thing

1490
01:29:51,175 --> 01:29:54,875
Speaker 5:  is this is a WhatsApp commercial. And then you watch and you're like, oh,

1491
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:58,835
Speaker 5:  this is super a WhatsApp commercial. I have a friend who's been in

1492
01:29:58,985 --> 01:30:02,795
Speaker 5:  like every kind of video production, like movies,

1493
01:30:02,975 --> 01:30:06,915
Speaker 5:  TV shows, advertising. And his, he's like, the end

1494
01:30:06,915 --> 01:30:10,835
Speaker 5:  of this is someone who's gonna win the Academy Award for best picture.

1495
01:30:11,295 --> 01:30:15,035
Speaker 5:  And the producer who accepts the award will be an advertiser.

1496
01:30:16,225 --> 01:30:20,015
Speaker 5:  Right. The, the end of this collapse of wow. Everything turning into marketing.

1497
01:30:20,265 --> 01:30:23,615
Speaker 5:  Everything is an ad for everything on YouTube is an ad for Ag G one. Right?

1498
01:30:23,615 --> 01:30:26,175
Speaker 5:  Like, like that's all it is. Like everyone's just trying to build these channels.

1499
01:30:26,175 --> 01:30:29,255
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So that they can do branded content, integrate in the thing. And at

1500
01:30:29,255 --> 01:30:33,015
Speaker 5:  the end of it you're gonna be like, best picture goes to Coca-Cola. It's,

1501
01:30:33,015 --> 01:30:36,055
Speaker 5:  this is his theory. I and I have laughed at him for years and I, I watched

1502
01:30:36,055 --> 01:30:36,815
Speaker 5:  this WhatsApp thing. I was

1503
01:30:36,815 --> 01:30:38,255
Speaker 6:  Like, that feels, that feels kind of right

1504
01:30:38,715 --> 01:30:40,895
Speaker 5:  Anyway, unsponsored for flavor. Do you know what I mean?

1505
01:30:41,195 --> 01:30:42,335
Speaker 6:  So, okay, here's, there's a weird

1506
01:30:42,335 --> 01:30:43,615
Speaker 5:  Thing. WhatsApp can't tell me what to do.

1507
01:30:45,885 --> 01:30:49,735
Speaker 6:  This whole conversation, we're gonna run this episode as a WhatsApp

1508
01:30:49,735 --> 01:30:50,255
Speaker 6:  video call.

1509
01:30:51,935 --> 01:30:55,815
Speaker 5:  I have said WhatsApp ine a lot. So you never don't

1510
01:30:55,815 --> 01:30:57,535
Speaker 6:  Even get paid for it. Maybe we're the idiots.

1511
01:30:59,015 --> 01:31:01,055
Speaker 5:  I mean, in many ways we are the idiots.

1512
01:31:03,215 --> 01:31:05,495
Speaker 5:  Everyone else is like driving their acid Martins around.

1513
01:31:07,715 --> 01:31:11,655
Speaker 5:  That's all I'm saying. I'm buying $200 boxes for man Amazon to retrofit

1514
01:31:11,655 --> 01:31:15,135
Speaker 5:  CarPlay and my 10-year-old car. Like, it's a very different world we live

1515
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:15,775
Speaker 5:  in. But

1516
01:31:17,425 --> 01:31:21,305
Speaker 5:  I much prefer not being told what to do. Hmm. And I assure you, all

1517
01:31:21,305 --> 01:31:23,625
Speaker 5:  the people who do these integrations, they get told what to do.

1518
01:31:23,965 --> 01:31:27,465
Speaker 6:  The best career advice I ever got was from somebody who told me that every

1519
01:31:27,465 --> 01:31:30,985
Speaker 6:  time you do well in your career, you're gonna get to choose between power

1520
01:31:31,005 --> 01:31:33,785
Speaker 6:  and autonomy. And you should always choose autonomy. That's pretty good.

1521
01:31:33,845 --> 01:31:34,585
Speaker 6:  That's good advice.

1522
01:31:34,925 --> 01:31:38,865
Speaker 5:  Anyway, if you'd like to sup continue to support us just yelling

1523
01:31:38,965 --> 01:31:41,785
Speaker 5:  at companies and not being able to be told what to do, you can subscribe

1524
01:31:41,785 --> 01:31:44,265
Speaker 5:  to the verse. That's the, that's the engine that powers this whole little

1525
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:45,945
Speaker 6:  Operation. That's how Neli gets his ass in. Martin.

1526
01:31:47,815 --> 01:31:51,545
Speaker 5:  It's, look, I'm, I'm telling you right now, I can get you into a

1527
01:31:51,545 --> 01:31:55,185
Speaker 5:  2007 Escalade with 159,000 miles on the clock for

1528
01:31:55,185 --> 01:31:56,265
Speaker 5:  89 95. David,

1529
01:31:57,465 --> 01:31:59,260
Speaker 6:  I mean, I'm down We go split seats. The three of us

Speaker 5:  98 K on the clock. 16, nine.

1533
01:32:10,805 --> 01:32:14,105
Speaker 6:  No, I think, I think we go, we go smaller 'cause we're gonna retrofit it

1534
01:32:14,105 --> 01:32:15,265
Speaker 6:  as our mobile podcast studio.

1535
01:32:16,285 --> 01:32:17,545
Speaker 5:  So you gotta rip out the inside.

1536
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:19,385
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Because we don't need the fancy stuff.

1537
01:32:19,995 --> 01:32:23,145
Speaker 5:  Every time I despair about the car industry, I remind myself that you can

1538
01:32:23,145 --> 01:32:26,305
Speaker 5:  just buy an old Escalade for no money. And that is a viable option.

1539
01:32:27,935 --> 01:32:30,665
Speaker 5:  It's like the best thing you can do with your, your car budget is be like,

1540
01:32:30,685 --> 01:32:33,705
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm buying an old Escalade. I'm not saying 'cause it's like a great

1541
01:32:33,725 --> 01:32:36,825
Speaker 5:  or reliable car that the previous owners have treated them. Well, I'm saying

1542
01:32:36,825 --> 01:32:39,705
Speaker 5:  that at any moment if you're like, I'm a little in the dumps, you're like,

1543
01:32:39,705 --> 01:32:40,545
Speaker 5:  I could just buy an Escalade

1544
01:32:41,605 --> 01:32:43,895
Speaker 6:  That does make I, I feel better. Do you see what I'm saying? That's real.

1545
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:48,215
Speaker 5:  Like I can get 180 9 0.95. All right David. It's

1546
01:32:48,215 --> 01:32:48,375
Speaker 5:  time.

1547
01:32:49,515 --> 01:32:52,535
Speaker 6:  Oh my God. Ne Now we have a countdown of these. We only get to do so many

1548
01:32:52,535 --> 01:32:55,015
Speaker 6:  of these until we have to stop for a minute. So we,

1549
01:32:55,165 --> 01:32:56,855
Speaker 5:  Both of my children will be doing them in

1550
01:32:58,605 --> 01:33:01,935
Speaker 6:  It's time for America's favorite podcast. Within a podcast.

1551
01:33:03,055 --> 01:33:04,265
Speaker 6:  Brendan Carr is a dummy.

1552
01:33:04,565 --> 01:33:07,945
Speaker 5:  All right. This week on Brendan Carr is a dummy. We have, what I can only

1553
01:33:08,345 --> 01:33:10,185
Speaker 5:  describe is a moral dilemma.

1554
01:33:10,925 --> 01:33:14,225
Speaker 6:  Unlike, I guess the other ones are not moral dilemmas. It's just moral outrage.

1555
01:33:14,695 --> 01:33:14,985
Speaker 6:  It's

1556
01:33:14,985 --> 01:33:18,105
Speaker 5:  Moral outrage. Usually in Brendan Carr is a dummy, we present. But one story,

1557
01:33:18,595 --> 01:33:22,585
Speaker 5:  which is Brendan Carr, who is a traitorous moron, shows up and says, I would

1558
01:33:22,585 --> 01:33:25,225
Speaker 5:  like to use the power of the government to chill your speech. And then we

1559
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:28,345
Speaker 5:  point out that the First Amendment exists and Brendan's ideas are bad and

1560
01:33:28,345 --> 01:33:32,105
Speaker 5:  that he should feel bad about himself. And then we essentially threaten invite

1561
01:33:32,105 --> 01:33:35,985
Speaker 5:  him to come on the show and defend himself. Yeah. That's the,

1562
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:38,345
Speaker 5:  that's the structure of the thing. It's, you know, you buy the box of cereal,

1563
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:41,265
Speaker 5:  you get the marshmallows, everyone's happy. We, we sell what we sell here.

1564
01:33:42,465 --> 01:33:45,125
Speaker 5:  That's the structure behind cards. Done. Love it. And I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

1565
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:48,445
Speaker 5:  aware right? You gotta hit product. You, you, you gotta sing your hits. You

1566
01:33:48,445 --> 01:33:52,135
Speaker 5:  know, today, this week we're changing it up.

1567
01:33:52,475 --> 01:33:53,415
Speaker 5:  All right. We're going country

1568
01:33:56,465 --> 01:33:56,955
Speaker 5:  because

1569
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:02,605
Speaker 5:  it's it. I can't identify who the villain of the story is except for

1570
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:06,545
Speaker 5:  everyone. And then, and then you, you have no idea what to do. So this week

1571
01:34:08,385 --> 01:34:09,365
Speaker 5:  our, our boy Brendan

1572
01:34:11,215 --> 01:34:14,915
Speaker 5:  threatened to investigate Dish Network for not

1573
01:34:15,155 --> 01:34:19,115
Speaker 5:  using the spectrum. It obtained after T-Mobile bought Sprint.

1574
01:34:19,375 --> 01:34:23,355
Speaker 5:  And it was given Boost Network to run as our nation's

1575
01:34:23,355 --> 01:34:24,315
Speaker 5:  fourth wireless carrier.

1576
01:34:24,775 --> 01:34:27,995
Speaker 6:  Oh, we have a real worst person. You know, makes a great point. Kind what

1577
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:28,515
Speaker 6:  I'm situation.

1578
01:34:28,515 --> 01:34:30,635
Speaker 5:  You see what I'm saying? You see, don't worry, there's a, there's a twist

1579
01:34:30,635 --> 01:34:34,555
Speaker 5:  coming. Okay. But that's the heart of it, right? Is Brendan woke

1580
01:34:34,575 --> 01:34:36,565
Speaker 5:  up and he realized

1581
01:34:38,175 --> 01:34:41,795
Speaker 5:  for a reason that I'll come to that, it turns out

1582
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:46,355
Speaker 5:  Dish Network is not a viable fourth wireless carrier in

1583
01:34:46,355 --> 01:34:49,955
Speaker 5:  the United States. That project Gen Five sis their

1584
01:34:50,465 --> 01:34:53,275
Speaker 5:  plan to somehow use

1585
01:34:53,955 --> 01:34:57,565
Speaker 5:  AWS and a technology called Open ran to build a very,

1586
01:34:57,825 --> 01:35:00,965
Speaker 5:  to very quickly build. A fourth National wireless carrier

1587
01:35:01,755 --> 01:35:02,445
Speaker 5:  came to nothing.

1588
01:35:03,955 --> 01:35:06,575
Speaker 5:  By the way, it's called Gensy. 'cause they saw Genesis with a five. This

1589
01:35:06,575 --> 01:35:10,095
Speaker 5:  is a real thing. I'm not kidding. We, we've done a lot of coverage Yep. Of

1590
01:35:10,095 --> 01:35:13,255
Speaker 5:  Project Genesis over the years. Project Gen Fivey. And it, it has effectively

1591
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:16,535
Speaker 5:  come to nothing. It launched in like two markets with one phone,

1592
01:35:17,315 --> 01:35:21,075
Speaker 5:  like a Motorola Edge. We sent Mitchell Clark to like use

1593
01:35:21,075 --> 01:35:24,715
Speaker 5:  this phone back in the day. And he was like, this sucks. This is, this is

1594
01:35:24,715 --> 01:35:28,155
Speaker 5:  in 2022. Nothing has happened since 2022. At one point there was an entire

1595
01:35:28,155 --> 01:35:31,435
Speaker 5:  crypto scam grafted onto the back of Project Genesis. Like

1596
01:35:32,045 --> 01:35:35,605
Speaker 5:  everything except Building Network. And if you'll remember,

1597
01:35:36,395 --> 01:35:40,205
Speaker 5:  this all came about because Brendan's predecessor at the

1598
01:35:40,285 --> 01:35:43,765
Speaker 5:  FCC Ajit Pi under the first Trump administration

1599
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:47,735
Speaker 5:  rubber stamped T-Mobile buying Sprint. And

1600
01:35:47,735 --> 01:35:51,295
Speaker 5:  the solution they came up with to the reduction of competition in the

1601
01:35:51,295 --> 01:35:55,175
Speaker 5:  United States was to say, okay, you can buy Sprint and

1602
01:35:55,195 --> 01:35:58,915
Speaker 5:  you have to sell some spectrum and boost to

1603
01:35:59,585 --> 01:36:03,565
Speaker 5:  Dish Network, which is gonna wake up and realize that

1604
01:36:03,565 --> 01:36:07,085
Speaker 5:  it's a viable national wireless carrier and preserve

1605
01:36:07,085 --> 01:36:09,205
Speaker 5:  competition so that we'll still have four national carriers in the country.

1606
01:36:09,885 --> 01:36:13,735
Speaker 5:  This was their plan. They allowed this merger to happen, which resulted

1607
01:36:14,075 --> 01:36:17,725
Speaker 5:  in thousands of layoffs and higher

1608
01:36:17,725 --> 01:36:21,605
Speaker 5:  prices. 'cause we reduced competition. And they said Dish Network will

1609
01:36:21,605 --> 01:36:25,325
Speaker 5:  fix it. Dish Network is gonna stand up a new network using this new technology

1610
01:36:25,325 --> 01:36:29,165
Speaker 5:  called Open Ran, which is interesting. OOO Open Ran

1611
01:36:29,165 --> 01:36:32,925
Speaker 5:  is the idea that the, the hardware and software inside of a cell tower

1612
01:36:33,265 --> 01:36:36,565
Speaker 5:  should be more interoperable. So like more companies can provide it. And

1613
01:36:36,565 --> 01:36:39,845
Speaker 5:  this is way you avoid big dependencies on a company like Huawei, which is

1614
01:36:39,855 --> 01:36:42,485
Speaker 5:  controlled by the Chinese government. This is a real problem. And the way

1615
01:36:42,485 --> 01:36:45,365
Speaker 5:  we're gonna do is by making things interoperable to promote competition.

1616
01:36:45,475 --> 01:36:47,925
Speaker 5:  That has not played out. I would just point out just like, no, none of this

1617
01:36:48,085 --> 01:36:50,925
Speaker 5:  happened. No, it was all good ideas. Pie. The Guy stuff Dish Network did

1618
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:54,485
Speaker 5:  not build the network. So Brandon has notice this has happened and he wrote

1619
01:36:54,685 --> 01:36:58,365
Speaker 5:  a letter to EchoStar, which owns Dish Network. And he said, I've directed

1620
01:36:58,365 --> 01:37:01,165
Speaker 5:  agency staff to begin a review of Echo Star's compliance with its federal

1621
01:37:01,165 --> 01:37:04,525
Speaker 5:  obligations to provide 5G service throughout the United States per the terms

1622
01:37:04,525 --> 01:37:08,405
Speaker 5:  of its federal spectrum licenses that you hold a number of FCC

1623
01:37:08,525 --> 01:37:11,445
Speaker 5:  spectrum licenses that cover a significant amount of spectrum. You haven't

1624
01:37:11,445 --> 01:37:14,865
Speaker 5:  used them. Obviously EchoStar says

1625
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:19,905
Speaker 5:  it, it warned its investors that we, we have made it wireless

1626
01:37:19,905 --> 01:37:23,265
Speaker 5:  network. No one can see it, but it's there. And then it, it quote cannot

1627
01:37:23,265 --> 01:37:26,065
Speaker 5:  predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the SEC proceedings.

1628
01:37:26,805 --> 01:37:30,785
Speaker 5:  One, because I think it can predict the outcome. And two,

1629
01:37:30,785 --> 01:37:33,625
Speaker 5:  because you can't predict Brendan. Right? Like Brendan's gonna be like, have

1630
01:37:33,625 --> 01:37:36,265
Speaker 5:  you thought about being 25% more racist? You'll be fine. Like, that's like

1631
01:37:36,305 --> 01:37:40,065
Speaker 5:  a n normal outcome of a Brendan car investigation. Okay, so

1632
01:37:40,065 --> 01:37:43,925
Speaker 5:  here's the twist first, Brendan is investigating a deal his own predecessor

1633
01:37:43,925 --> 01:37:46,845
Speaker 5:  made, and no one can predict the outcome, at least of all the company. So

1634
01:37:46,845 --> 01:37:49,085
Speaker 5:  that's one. That's weird, right? Why is Brendan doing this?

1635
01:37:51,075 --> 01:37:54,935
Speaker 5:  Come on. You already know. Everybody knows why, because SpaceX wants

1636
01:37:54,985 --> 01:37:57,725
Speaker 5:  the spectrum and Brendan wants to give it to his buddy Elon Musk.

1637
01:37:58,845 --> 01:38:02,695
Speaker 6:  This is getting so boring. It's like, at least, at least like I, I was

1638
01:38:02,695 --> 01:38:06,495
Speaker 6:  genuinely in this moment rooting for Brendan to have like, made a good

1639
01:38:06,695 --> 01:38:09,735
Speaker 6:  decision that it's like, and and in the name of journalistic credibility,

1640
01:38:09,735 --> 01:38:11,295
Speaker 6:  we're like, we gotta give Brendan one this week.

1641
01:38:13,365 --> 01:38:14,385
Speaker 6:  But no, but

1642
01:38:14,585 --> 01:38:18,305
Speaker 5:  I don't know it, it's true that I've railed against Dish Network. Sure.

1643
01:38:18,445 --> 01:38:19,745
Speaker 5:  Stupid idea for years.

1644
01:38:21,325 --> 01:38:25,065
Speaker 5:  But where did this come from? What's the evidence that Brendan is tying this

1645
01:38:25,345 --> 01:38:25,785
Speaker 5:  investigation to?

1646
01:38:27,515 --> 01:38:31,055
Speaker 5:  SpaceX said one of its satellites measured the power spectral density levels

1647
01:38:31,195 --> 01:38:35,055
Speaker 5:  in the bands that Dish Network has and found the dish's use of those bands

1648
01:38:35,055 --> 01:38:38,885
Speaker 5:  as diminish, diminish the best. So just SpaceX is like, we

1649
01:38:38,885 --> 01:38:42,445
Speaker 5:  look, hey, we took it upon ourselves. We pointed one of our satellites at

1650
01:38:42,445 --> 01:38:46,325
Speaker 5:  the entire country, measured on the spectrum usage. And trust us, bro,

1651
01:38:46,325 --> 01:38:49,245
Speaker 5:  they're not using it. So can we have it? And Brendan immediately fired off

1652
01:38:49,245 --> 01:38:52,645
Speaker 5:  a letter saying you're not using it. I, within an investigation, SpaceX

1653
01:38:53,085 --> 01:38:56,685
Speaker 5:  says, SpaceX said The spectrum that Dish is using remains

1654
01:38:56,915 --> 01:39:00,805
Speaker 5:  ripe for sharing among next generation satellite systems that seek to

1655
01:39:00,805 --> 01:39:04,365
Speaker 5:  finally make productive use of the spectrum for consumers and first responders.

1656
01:39:04,815 --> 01:39:08,695
Speaker 5:  First of all, the spectrum was being used before

1657
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:12,735
Speaker 5:  they sold spread to T-Mobile and gave the spectrum to Dish network.

1658
01:39:13,665 --> 01:39:16,325
Speaker 5:  I'm not saying Sprint was a great company, they sucked in a variety of ways,

1659
01:39:16,425 --> 01:39:18,245
Speaker 6:  But it was in fact using the spectrum. But it was

1660
01:39:18,245 --> 01:39:18,325
Speaker 5:  Using

1661
01:39:18,465 --> 01:39:19,565
Speaker 6:  The spectrum use Sprint people

1662
01:39:19,565 --> 01:39:23,405
Speaker 5:  Did. And then, yeah, and then finally make use of this spectrum for consumers

1663
01:39:23,405 --> 01:39:27,225
Speaker 5:  and first responders. It's like, yeah, like all the other companies exist.

1664
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:32,025
Speaker 5:  Like if you would like to get first responders better cell coverage using

1665
01:39:32,025 --> 01:39:35,825
Speaker 5:  the spectrum, you would give it to one of the companies that actually

1666
01:39:35,825 --> 01:39:39,465
Speaker 5:  operates a wireless network, right? That would be the outcome. You wouldn't

1667
01:39:39,465 --> 01:39:42,185
Speaker 5:  be like SpaceX, can you horsepower up a new solution

1668
01:39:43,285 --> 01:39:45,945
Speaker 5:  the same way you ask Dish Network to horsepower up a new network?

1669
01:39:47,805 --> 01:39:51,785
Speaker 5:  What are we doing here? So we'll see what happens. There's we'll link, there's

1670
01:39:51,785 --> 01:39:54,825
Speaker 5:  a bunch of reporting about this. We'll link to it. But this weekend, Brandon Carr

1671
01:39:54,825 --> 01:39:58,225
Speaker 5:  is a dummy. He has done the right thing for the

1672
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:02,355
Speaker 5:  stupidest possible reason. And the funniest thing about this is

1673
01:40:02,355 --> 01:40:05,895
Speaker 5:  it's his predecessor's deal. They promised us

1674
01:40:06,165 --> 01:40:09,775
Speaker 5:  when they made this deal allowing T-Mobile to buy Sprint,

1675
01:40:10,355 --> 01:40:13,655
Speaker 5:  the Dish Network would meet its commitments to stand up a fourth wireless

1676
01:40:13,655 --> 01:40:16,655
Speaker 5:  network using the spectrum, using the boost assets.

1677
01:40:17,565 --> 01:40:21,305
Speaker 5:  And everyone knew, just like we knew with Max, that this would

1678
01:40:21,315 --> 01:40:25,125
Speaker 5:  never happen. Never in a million years would this happen.

1679
01:40:25,425 --> 01:40:29,085
Speaker 5:  And every time we reported on it and the reporting consisted of,

1680
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:32,885
Speaker 5:  we're gonna go to Las Vegas and see if there's a wireless network there,

1681
01:40:33,675 --> 01:40:36,125
Speaker 5:  they would be like, you don't know what you're talking about. Ridiculous.

1682
01:40:36,195 --> 01:40:40,115
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Don't let the mergers happen. I it, this is just more merger

1683
01:40:40,165 --> 01:40:43,785
Speaker 5:  chaos. Do you know what the best thing to happen to the

1684
01:40:44,145 --> 01:40:47,145
Speaker 5:  American wireless industry is? The single best thing that's happened in the

1685
01:40:47,145 --> 01:40:50,585
Speaker 5:  past 15 years to the American wireless industry at t was blocked

1686
01:40:50,935 --> 01:40:54,725
Speaker 5:  from buying T-Mobile. Yeah. That's by far the best thing

1687
01:40:54,725 --> 01:40:56,125
Speaker 5:  that happens to the American wireless solution.

1688
01:40:56,185 --> 01:40:57,205
Speaker 6:  And then they uncarrier.

1689
01:40:57,505 --> 01:41:01,245
Speaker 5:  Yep. And they hired John Ledger and they at and t had to pay a bunch of money

1690
01:41:01,245 --> 01:41:05,045
Speaker 5:  in a breakup feed at T-Mobile. So T-Mobile got recapitalized important,

1691
01:41:05,045 --> 01:41:07,205
Speaker 5:  important piece of puzzle. But that only happened 'cause they were blocked

1692
01:41:07,205 --> 01:41:10,845
Speaker 5:  from buying it. And then John Ledger showed up and said, what is this industry

1693
01:41:12,115 --> 01:41:15,005
Speaker 5:  what I have to be competitive now? I'm gonna do a bunch of stuff to make

1694
01:41:15,005 --> 01:41:18,645
Speaker 5:  this industry more competitive, to win some customers and try to succeed

1695
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:22,845
Speaker 5:  instead of just cashing out and letting at and t burn

1696
01:41:22,845 --> 01:41:26,485
Speaker 5:  money, making 4, 4, 3 grayscale Batman movies

1697
01:41:27,315 --> 01:41:30,605
Speaker 5:  compete. It makes everything better. As always. I would

1698
01:41:31,715 --> 01:41:35,285
Speaker 5:  respond to the many critics who show up to say that I'm, you know, just some

1699
01:41:35,395 --> 01:41:38,965
Speaker 5:  woke DEI hire by pointing out that the only consistent opinions that I expressed

1700
01:41:38,965 --> 01:41:41,605
Speaker 5:  on the show regarding politics are that free markets are good. Competition

1701
01:41:41,605 --> 01:41:44,565
Speaker 5:  makes for better products, and you should be a little bit less racist than

1702
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:47,445
Speaker 5:  Brendan. And that's all I'm really asking for. And if you think that's super

1703
01:41:47,445 --> 01:41:49,645
Speaker 5:  liberal, that's fine, but I, I don't know about that.

1704
01:41:51,065 --> 01:41:54,605
Speaker 5:  Anyhow, that's been Brendan Cars, the dummy b Brendan, as always. If you

1705
01:41:54,605 --> 01:41:58,125
Speaker 5:  have the wherewithal, the emotional fortitude, or even the raw intelligence

1706
01:41:58,305 --> 01:42:02,205
Speaker 5:  to show up and defend these back asswards decisions, you're welcome.

1707
01:42:02,205 --> 01:42:06,155
Speaker 5:  On our shows. You the fanciest CEOs in the

1708
01:42:06,395 --> 01:42:09,035
Speaker 5:  industry show up under coder and defend themselves to me and they're able

1709
01:42:09,035 --> 01:42:11,515
Speaker 5:  to do it. I don't think you can do it. I don't think you're gonna show up.

1710
01:42:12,195 --> 01:42:14,675
Speaker 5:  I think you're a dumb coward. But if you want to, the door's always open,

1711
01:42:14,675 --> 01:42:15,035
Speaker 5:  my friend.

1712
01:42:15,245 --> 01:42:18,955
Speaker 6:  Maybe he has Project Gen five sis and just like can't

1713
01:42:18,975 --> 01:42:20,115
Speaker 6:  access this podcast.

1714
01:42:20,465 --> 01:42:23,875
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He's out there collecting one quarter of an NFT at a time every time

1715
01:42:23,875 --> 01:42:26,155
Speaker 5:  he sends a text message Boost Mobile

1716
01:42:27,455 --> 01:42:30,315
Speaker 5:  that's been Brenna Carr's dummy America's favorite podcast. In the podcast.

1717
01:42:31,175 --> 01:42:34,555
Speaker 6:  It was great. It was a great one. I treasure them all even more now knowing

1718
01:42:35,405 --> 01:42:38,345
Speaker 6:  we will have to take a break because God help Jake, if he has to do this

1719
01:42:38,345 --> 01:42:38,585
Speaker 6:  every

1720
01:42:38,585 --> 01:42:42,185
Speaker 7:  Week, I I'm gonna have neli just like do a little voice memo on his phone.

1721
01:42:42,745 --> 01:42:46,665
Speaker 7:  I, I assume he'll, he will, you know, have some crazed moment in the middle

1722
01:42:46,665 --> 01:42:50,305
Speaker 7:  of the night when he needs to, to let out some steam. And we'll just

1723
01:42:50,655 --> 01:42:52,025
Speaker 7:  play that right into the mic. Maybe. Can

1724
01:42:52,025 --> 01:42:55,065
Speaker 5:  You imagine if you could send a letter to the FCC being like, I've, I've

1725
01:42:55,065 --> 01:42:57,865
Speaker 5:  graded my own homework and I should get the spectrum.

1726
01:42:58,945 --> 01:43:02,625
Speaker 7:  I mean, we, we should have just been putting that at the end of all of our

1727
01:43:02,665 --> 01:43:05,385
Speaker 7:  articles, like, Hey, this dish thing isn't happening. Can you give it to

1728
01:43:05,385 --> 01:43:08,345
Speaker 7:  us? Like we'll use it. Yeah. I

1729
01:43:08,505 --> 01:43:12,385
Speaker 5:  I i, it, it is just very funny that we pointed a satellite who knew that

1730
01:43:12,385 --> 01:43:15,465
Speaker 5:  works and just like measured this guy's user. It's like, you don't have to

1731
01:43:15,465 --> 01:43:18,945
Speaker 5:  do that much work, man. You just have to be like, does this exist? Yeah,

1732
01:43:19,445 --> 01:43:22,905
Speaker 5:  you can go to the website project gen fivey.com. It's still there.

1733
01:43:23,375 --> 01:43:26,865
Speaker 5:  It's, it's called the Gen five sis five g.com. And

1734
01:43:27,245 --> 01:43:31,105
Speaker 5:  the la the last media and press update, like the newest

1735
01:43:31,245 --> 01:43:35,065
Speaker 5:  one is from 2022. And the headline is, dish adopts

1736
01:43:35,065 --> 01:43:38,785
Speaker 5:  America's chaos engineering platform to test and

1737
01:43:38,785 --> 01:43:41,945
Speaker 5:  ensure reliability. It's, and it's like, oh God.

1738
01:43:43,515 --> 01:43:46,785
Speaker 6:  First of all, chaos Engineering is a new name of our product design firm,

1739
01:43:46,925 --> 01:43:50,465
Speaker 6:  and I'm very excited about it. We're gonna do, it's like teenage

1740
01:43:50,785 --> 01:43:53,445
Speaker 6:  engineering, but like much worse. It's chaos engineering. And that's us.

1741
01:43:53,585 --> 01:43:54,245
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm limited

1742
01:43:54,245 --> 01:43:57,125
Speaker 5:  Into it. It's, it, I I believe it's a rif you know, a Netflix used to have

1743
01:43:57,125 --> 01:43:57,725
Speaker 5:  the Chaos Monkey

1744
01:43:58,185 --> 01:43:58,925
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. Which

1745
01:43:58,925 --> 01:44:02,405
Speaker 5:  Was its reliability tester where it would just, it would, it would simulate

1746
01:44:02,405 --> 01:44:06,045
Speaker 5:  just like people pulling servers outta the racks. I think that's what this

1747
01:44:06,045 --> 01:44:09,385
Speaker 5:  is. But it's just very funny that they put out a press release

1748
01:44:10,325 --> 01:44:14,095
Speaker 5:  release. I don't know, man. Anyhow, Brandon, if you're listening, I can get

1749
01:44:14,095 --> 01:44:17,415
Speaker 5:  you into a 2015 Cadillac escalated luxury for 80, 18 7

1750
01:44:18,555 --> 01:44:22,495
Speaker 5:  out the door. All right, let's talk. Yeah. All right. We need a power clean

1751
01:44:22,495 --> 01:44:23,695
Speaker 5:  here, David, what do we got? Can we talk

1752
01:44:23,695 --> 01:44:27,575
Speaker 6:  About Airbnb, which is like all the only thing I can

1753
01:44:27,575 --> 01:44:31,535
Speaker 6:  think about the last four eight hours. So Airbnb this week,

1754
01:44:32,645 --> 01:44:36,615
Speaker 6:  basically, like, it wants you to think it completely pivoted the

1755
01:44:36,615 --> 01:44:40,095
Speaker 6:  company. And, and Brian Chesky is out here. Steven Levy had a big piece in,

1756
01:44:40,115 --> 01:44:40,815
Speaker 6:  in Wired

1757
01:44:40,885 --> 01:44:42,095
Speaker 5:  Amazing photos in that piece.

1758
01:44:42,315 --> 01:44:45,615
Speaker 6:  Oh, they're, they're very good. And it's, it says some, the, the headline

1759
01:44:45,615 --> 01:44:49,495
Speaker 6:  is something like Airbnb is in midlife crisis mode, which I'm sure Airbnb

1760
01:44:49,495 --> 01:44:53,095
Speaker 6:  is not wild about, but it's kind of true. And it describes this like fever

1761
01:44:53,105 --> 01:44:57,015
Speaker 6:  dream that Brian Chesky had, in which he decided

1762
01:44:57,035 --> 01:45:00,695
Speaker 6:  to completely change what Airbnb is doing. Ironically, in the middle of all

1763
01:45:00,695 --> 01:45:04,295
Speaker 6:  of the open AI chaos that we covered, he was like a central figure

1764
01:45:04,595 --> 01:45:06,975
Speaker 6:  in sorting all this stuff out and

1765
01:45:08,475 --> 01:45:12,175
Speaker 6:  was like somehow inspired by this to go

1766
01:45:12,175 --> 01:45:15,455
Speaker 6:  create similar chaos at his own company. So they go through this whole thing

1767
01:45:15,455 --> 01:45:19,135
Speaker 6:  and Airbnb is now trying to pivot hard

1768
01:45:19,285 --> 01:45:22,015
Speaker 6:  into being more than just like, places to stay, but they're doing like

1769
01:45:22,725 --> 01:45:25,695
Speaker 6:  experiences, which they've kind of done in the past, but they're doing much

1770
01:45:25,695 --> 01:45:29,495
Speaker 6:  more aggressively now. And then services, like local services

1771
01:45:30,265 --> 01:45:34,095
Speaker 6:  where you are, I guess I just find this all

1772
01:45:34,165 --> 01:45:38,015
Speaker 6:  very weird. Like Airbnb seems to want

1773
01:45:38,015 --> 01:45:39,055
Speaker 6:  to be fancy Yelp,

1774
01:45:39,475 --> 01:45:42,895
Speaker 5:  But with transactions in it, that's the difference. Mm. You never transact

1775
01:45:43,055 --> 01:45:45,935
Speaker 5:  in Yelp, right? Yelp is a search engine, right? And you're like, find me

1776
01:45:46,055 --> 01:45:48,935
Speaker 5:  a, a hairdresser. And then it like shows you a list and there's reviews and

1777
01:45:49,095 --> 01:45:52,975
Speaker 5:  whatever, but you don't like do anything else. You just use it. And

1778
01:45:52,975 --> 01:45:56,655
Speaker 5:  people favor for listings. This is very much more like, I'm,

1779
01:45:57,215 --> 01:46:01,155
Speaker 5:  I need a haircut. I'm gonna open Airbnb and some like vetted

1780
01:46:01,505 --> 01:46:04,395
Speaker 5:  barbers and hairdressers will be available to me and they'll come to my house

1781
01:46:04,395 --> 01:46:04,915
Speaker 5:  and cut my hair

1782
01:46:05,045 --> 01:46:06,395
Speaker 7:  While you're on vacation while

1783
01:46:06,395 --> 01:46:07,635
Speaker 5:  You're on, or if not, which is like,

1784
01:46:07,635 --> 01:46:11,075
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I, I do think the, the single most interesting thing that they changed

1785
01:46:11,075 --> 01:46:14,675
Speaker 7:  here is when you open the app, there's three tabs. It is like

1786
01:46:14,735 --> 01:46:18,435
Speaker 7:  places to stay, experiences, services. The default

1787
01:46:18,535 --> 01:46:22,315
Speaker 7:  tab that it opens to is the experiences tab, which is just not

1788
01:46:22,465 --> 01:46:26,275
Speaker 7:  what Airbnb is known for. So I, I think like, you're right Eli,

1789
01:46:26,275 --> 01:46:29,995
Speaker 7:  they're pushing this very hard and there's a world where you just open this

1790
01:46:30,055 --> 01:46:33,715
Speaker 7:  and you order a private chef for the night to your house where you live,

1791
01:46:33,745 --> 01:46:37,675
Speaker 7:  even when you're not staying somewhere on vacation. I, I, I

1792
01:46:37,675 --> 01:46:41,395
Speaker 7:  think it's sort of a weird concept, but it makes a lot of sense, right? Like

1793
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:45,275
Speaker 7:  if you're only using Airbnb for one thing, then it's only one, you know,

1794
01:46:45,525 --> 01:46:49,075
Speaker 7:  thing place that they can make money. But now if they can sell you

1795
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:52,285
Speaker 7:  experiences to do while you're in that place, if they can sell me experiences

1796
01:46:52,345 --> 01:46:56,285
Speaker 7:  to do while I live here in New York City, like that is a big

1797
01:46:56,305 --> 01:46:57,125
Speaker 7:  new market for them.

1798
01:46:57,305 --> 01:47:00,765
Speaker 6:  And that is actually, that is a market. No one is doing a very good job of

1799
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:02,965
Speaker 6:  like, I don't know if you guys ever have this experience, but I have it all

1800
01:47:02,965 --> 01:47:06,885
Speaker 6:  the time where it's like, oh, what's going on near me this weekend? And the

1801
01:47:06,885 --> 01:47:10,725
Speaker 6:  answer is, you check 58 websites and you end up on like an Eventbrite listing

1802
01:47:10,825 --> 01:47:14,325
Speaker 6:  for a thing you've never heard of. And that's the best you can do. And at

1803
01:47:14,325 --> 01:47:17,885
Speaker 6:  various times, different companies have tried to tackle the, like,

1804
01:47:18,065 --> 01:47:22,045
Speaker 6:  what's going on around me? Problem. Nobody's ever done a very

1805
01:47:22,045 --> 01:47:24,565
Speaker 6:  good job of it. And it, I I think you're right Jake, that there is a big

1806
01:47:24,565 --> 01:47:27,805
Speaker 6:  opportunity and a big business there and being the one that is like

1807
01:47:28,765 --> 01:47:32,605
Speaker 6:  a a anywhere you are, even if it's at home, if you want to like explore

1808
01:47:32,665 --> 01:47:35,005
Speaker 6:  and find stuff to do, come here.

1809
01:47:36,425 --> 01:47:39,845
Speaker 6:  Airbnb makes a certain kind of sense as that platform, except that it's been

1810
01:47:39,845 --> 01:47:42,365
Speaker 6:  trying to do that and failing for a really long time.

1811
01:47:44,605 --> 01:47:48,545
Speaker 6:  And so now to double down on that, but then also add, like, I just don't

1812
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:52,305
Speaker 6:  know that I need, I am on vacation and I wanna find a place to get a

1813
01:47:52,305 --> 01:47:55,385
Speaker 6:  massage is like a unsolved problem, right?

1814
01:47:55,725 --> 01:47:59,065
Speaker 7:  And it's, everything on there is like a little hokey right now and

1815
01:47:59,985 --> 01:48:03,065
Speaker 7:  admittedly it's touristy stuff. Like it's fine, right? But it's like, do

1816
01:48:03,105 --> 01:48:06,425
Speaker 7:  a pizza tour, right? Get a photo in Times Square. Well,

1817
01:48:06,425 --> 01:48:07,505
Speaker 5:  I mean, you're in New York and it's like,

1818
01:48:07,505 --> 01:48:09,665
Speaker 7:  That's what, that's what you're here for. It's fair. Like you may as well

1819
01:48:09,665 --> 01:48:13,305
Speaker 7:  do it there, but yeah, I I I'm not

1820
01:48:13,415 --> 01:48:17,225
Speaker 7:  sure if that is what is going to solve it for people, right? Like

1821
01:48:17,335 --> 01:48:20,345
Speaker 7:  they, they have offered these things already and maybe it just feels more

1822
01:48:20,345 --> 01:48:23,625
Speaker 7:  legitimate because it's now like front and center in the app.

1823
01:48:24,295 --> 01:48:27,625
Speaker 7:  It's certainly more convenient. Right. You were probably gonna go on that

1824
01:48:27,625 --> 01:48:28,145
Speaker 7:  pizza tour.

1825
01:48:28,625 --> 01:48:32,345
Speaker 5:  I mean, I'm thinking about it. Brian Chesky is actually on decoder

1826
01:48:32,545 --> 01:48:35,425
Speaker 5:  tomorrow as we're speaking. I'm, I'm preparing to interview him tomorrow

1827
01:48:35,425 --> 01:48:38,505
Speaker 5:  about all this stuff. This is, I think his third time on the show. He is,

1828
01:48:38,615 --> 01:48:42,025
Speaker 5:  he's great on decoder. He loves explaining how he thinks. So I'm very curious

1829
01:48:42,565 --> 01:48:46,385
Speaker 5:  if he's doing the same thing that I've seen from other companies. Like

1830
01:48:46,385 --> 01:48:50,105
Speaker 5:  Uber just had an event this week. D the CEO of Uber also

1831
01:48:50,105 --> 01:48:53,265
Speaker 5:  taped a decoder this week. And you know, their, their whole thing is like

1832
01:48:53,265 --> 01:48:56,985
Speaker 5:  route sharing and scheduling your commute and Uber one subscriptions and

1833
01:48:57,045 --> 01:49:00,985
Speaker 5:  all of these companies, they were kind of like, push a button for a service

1834
01:49:01,245 --> 01:49:05,065
Speaker 5:  one time or you know, a few times a week. Or in Airbnb's case, like maybe

1835
01:49:05,065 --> 01:49:08,745
Speaker 5:  a couple times a year, they're like, we want you to use this every day. Like

1836
01:49:08,745 --> 01:49:11,145
Speaker 5:  that's how they're gonna grow. They all think they're gonna grow in this

1837
01:49:11,145 --> 01:49:14,865
Speaker 5:  way. Like you need a relationship with Uber and you're gonna schedule

1838
01:49:14,975 --> 01:49:17,585
Speaker 5:  commute an Uber that you do every single day and you're gonna have this like,

1839
01:49:17,585 --> 01:49:20,505
Speaker 5:  ongoing relationship with Uber. That's, that's a big part of their growth,

1840
01:49:20,505 --> 01:49:24,385
Speaker 5:  right? Yeah. For revenue anyway. It's kind, it feels like the same

1841
01:49:24,385 --> 01:49:25,265
Speaker 5:  move for Airbnb.

1842
01:49:25,495 --> 01:49:28,465
Speaker 6:  Well, and in the same way that they're like, we have this core underlying

1843
01:49:28,465 --> 01:49:32,255
Speaker 6:  technology that like, Airbnb is fundamentally like a guest

1844
01:49:32,595 --> 01:49:36,415
Speaker 6:  and host matching platform, right? And it's like if you, if you just expand

1845
01:49:36,655 --> 01:49:40,495
Speaker 6:  that out, you get to, well, people need to book things

1846
01:49:40,595 --> 01:49:43,895
Speaker 6:  and people need to have things booked. So sure we'll do that.

1847
01:49:44,795 --> 01:49:48,765
Speaker 6:  But like, there's a lot of those, those out in the world. I

1848
01:49:48,765 --> 01:49:52,595
Speaker 6:  don't know, I just, I'm, I am, maybe you're right in

1849
01:49:52,615 --> 01:49:55,795
Speaker 6:  Eli, that being the one that processes the payments and manages it all is,

1850
01:49:55,895 --> 01:49:56,715
Speaker 6:  is meaningful.

1851
01:49:58,295 --> 01:50:00,995
Speaker 6:  But I'm just not sure. I'm like, if I, if I wanna find a place to have dinner

1852
01:50:01,065 --> 01:50:04,915
Speaker 6:  near my Airbnb, I have a hard time imagining that the

1853
01:50:04,915 --> 01:50:07,235
Speaker 6:  first thing I'm gonna do is open the Airbnb app.

1854
01:50:07,505 --> 01:50:09,955
Speaker 5:  Well, I mean that's, that's their challenge. I gotta teach people to do that.

1855
01:50:10,115 --> 01:50:13,875
Speaker 5:  I think it's, i I I think that side of it is like different 'cause

1856
01:50:14,015 --> 01:50:17,915
Speaker 5:  you know, the, there's 10 chefs available in my, my area

1857
01:50:18,015 --> 01:50:21,235
Speaker 5:  and it's like, yeah, I have no idea how to get a private chef.

1858
01:50:21,725 --> 01:50:25,475
Speaker 5:  Especially if I'm on vacation. And I think there's a lot of people that are

1859
01:50:25,475 --> 01:50:28,835
Speaker 5:  like, okay, I've, I like, you know, my whole friend group is gonna rent a

1860
01:50:28,835 --> 01:50:32,755
Speaker 5:  house and it would be sick to have a private chef and like now it's a

1861
01:50:32,755 --> 01:50:36,325
Speaker 5:  button. And like if you can just build that muscle that's like, oh, I could

1862
01:50:36,325 --> 01:50:39,205
Speaker 5:  do that at home. Yes, there's something there. Again, I'm excited to talk

1863
01:50:39,205 --> 01:50:42,685
Speaker 5:  to Brian tomorrow. I I share a lot of these same doubts. Will

1864
01:50:42,685 --> 01:50:45,605
Speaker 6:  You ask Brian if he has any friends who aren't billionaires? Because that

1865
01:50:45,865 --> 01:50:48,685
Speaker 6:  the thing you just described is a billionaire problem.

1866
01:50:49,085 --> 01:50:51,765
Speaker 5:  I don't think it's a billionaire problem. I, I think the reason people get

1867
01:50:51,945 --> 01:50:55,845
Speaker 5:  big Airbnb houses is 'cause if you can split the cost with enough

1868
01:50:55,845 --> 01:50:59,735
Speaker 5:  people, it starts to feel reasonable, right? And

1869
01:50:59,995 --> 01:51:02,815
Speaker 5:  I'm, I, I've never actually booked a private chef. I don't know if the math

1870
01:51:02,815 --> 01:51:06,735
Speaker 5:  works the same way for private chef. I'm still scrounging pennies

1871
01:51:06,735 --> 01:51:09,735
Speaker 5:  to buy a Cadillac skate for 89 point 95. But

1872
01:51:10,835 --> 01:51:14,055
Speaker 5:  it, that's how that math works for a lot of people, right? We can all get

1873
01:51:14,055 --> 01:51:16,695
Speaker 5:  our own hotel room or we can pool our money and get a sick house where we

1874
01:51:16,695 --> 01:51:20,375
Speaker 5:  can like I hear that all the time. If you can add onto that,

1875
01:51:20,815 --> 01:51:24,175
Speaker 5:  I mean this is my entire thesis about limos in Las Vegas, right? Like

1876
01:51:24,765 --> 01:51:28,535
Speaker 5:  it's no fun to be in a limo by yourself. Like

1877
01:51:28,595 --> 01:51:32,295
Speaker 5:  that's the saddest you can be is drunk in Vegas alone in a limo

1878
01:51:32,845 --> 01:51:35,455
Speaker 5:  like that, that is as Drake as I've ever felt my entire time.

1879
01:51:38,595 --> 01:51:41,975
Speaker 5:  But you, you put 10 people in. This is the best experience I've ever had.

1880
01:51:42,585 --> 01:51:45,495
Speaker 5:  Right? And there's just something about that that I, you can see them trying

1881
01:51:45,495 --> 01:51:48,935
Speaker 5:  to tap into here. I don't think it's, I need to find a restaurant near me.

1882
01:51:48,975 --> 01:51:52,255
Speaker 5:  I think, I think it's some, it's some other thing that's like, can we make

1883
01:51:52,255 --> 01:51:53,735
Speaker 5:  this a little bit more special as a group?

1884
01:51:54,435 --> 01:51:58,225
Speaker 6:  That's fair. I, and I I, I can see that

1885
01:51:58,225 --> 01:52:00,905
Speaker 6:  working. I just don't think that road is very long.

1886
01:52:02,175 --> 01:52:06,025
Speaker 6:  Like there's just not the list of things that qualify under that rubric

1887
01:52:06,655 --> 01:52:07,585
Speaker 6:  just isn't huge.

1888
01:52:08,345 --> 01:52:12,105
Speaker 5:  I do wanna make one addendum to my, my limo comment, which is one year at

1889
01:52:12,185 --> 01:52:16,105
Speaker 5:  CESI got a Cadillac Escalade limo from the airport by myself. And I took

1890
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:19,425
Speaker 5:  it to Shake Shack by myself in that ruled

1891
01:52:19,935 --> 01:52:20,865
Speaker 6:  That, that, I mean,

1892
01:52:23,235 --> 01:52:26,695
Speaker 5:  Las Vegas the only city in America, in the world I think where you can just

1893
01:52:26,755 --> 01:52:30,655
Speaker 5:  summon an Escalade limousine. Like you just like walk outside of a building

1894
01:52:30,675 --> 01:52:33,215
Speaker 5:  and be like, do you have a giant limo? And like 10 guys are like, oh yeah,

1895
01:52:33,215 --> 01:52:36,975
Speaker 5:  here I am. Can't have that experience anywhere else in the world. You gotta

1896
01:52:36,975 --> 01:52:38,255
Speaker 5:  that's why it's, that's what it's for.

1897
01:52:40,115 --> 01:52:42,475
Speaker 5:  I mean, I, I know other people think we has other purposes, but

1898
01:52:43,175 --> 01:52:43,715
Speaker 6:  No, that's it. That's

1899
01:52:44,215 --> 01:52:46,845
Speaker 5:  Not, there's the one. Yeah, but it's, that's what it's for. Alright, we gotta,

1900
01:52:46,845 --> 01:52:49,845
Speaker 5:  we gotta write this up. I'm gonna ask Brian Jetski how many people he is

1901
01:52:49,845 --> 01:52:51,965
Speaker 5:  ever. If he's ever been drunk alone in alone tomorrow.

1902
01:52:52,545 --> 01:52:53,085
Speaker 9:  That's good.

1903
01:52:53,865 --> 01:52:56,845
Speaker 5:  Let me know if you've got your shirts by the way. Party speaker update. Speaking

1904
01:52:56,845 --> 01:53:00,685
Speaker 5:  of that, many, many, many photos of party speakers this week on,

1905
01:53:00,825 --> 01:53:04,685
Speaker 5:  on like on transportation. We got one on an

1906
01:53:04,685 --> 01:53:08,405
Speaker 5:  airport shuttle, which seems deeply rude. Like, don't do that.

1907
01:53:08,745 --> 01:53:12,565
Speaker 5:  No confined spaces are not where party speakers go. Lots of

1908
01:53:12,565 --> 01:53:16,285
Speaker 5:  Nashville Bachelor party bike buses with party speakers on them. That's a

1909
01:53:16,285 --> 01:53:19,245
Speaker 5:  thing. And then here's the thing I want to know just to wrap this up.

1910
01:53:20,565 --> 01:53:24,425
Speaker 5:  So many pictures of party speakers, maybe a company called Ion, which I believe

1911
01:53:24,425 --> 01:53:28,385
Speaker 5:  is a house brand of, of one of the major retailers. I'm not sure if you

1912
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:31,915
Speaker 5:  know what ION is, if you know who run Ion, lemme know.

1913
01:53:32,425 --> 01:53:35,995
Speaker 5:  That's the next phase of our investigation. 'cause I think they'll talk.

1914
01:53:36,625 --> 01:53:40,395
Speaker 5:  I've been trying to get onto the Sony party speaker team for years. Like

1915
01:53:40,395 --> 01:53:42,955
Speaker 5:  I've gone to the highest levels of the s Sony Corporation and been like,

1916
01:53:43,435 --> 01:53:47,395
Speaker 5:  I know people in Japan. I will send them to the party speaker team and

1917
01:53:47,395 --> 01:53:50,995
Speaker 5:  they're like, not today that, that's some like Apple

1918
01:53:50,995 --> 01:53:53,955
Speaker 5:  design lap shit. You know what I mean? Like the room where they put the cup

1919
01:53:54,075 --> 01:53:56,995
Speaker 5:  holders in, the party speakers. I think the I people.

1920
01:53:58,935 --> 01:54:00,395
Speaker 5:  All right, that's it. That's for cha for,
