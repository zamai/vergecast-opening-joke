12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,320
Speaker 2:  Hello

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,280
Speaker 4:  And welcome to our chest. The flagship podcast of

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,120
Speaker 4:  the dynamic island. First of all, I wanna call it my friend

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,560
Speaker 4:  Joanna stern for actually taking a canoe to an island

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,200
Speaker 4:  for her review video

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,040
Speaker 5:  Was excellent

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,600
Speaker 4:  Every now and again. Joanna's like, what if I just do a little

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,440
Speaker 4:  bit more than everyone else would possibly do? And the

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,240
Speaker 4:  fact that she did her entire video on a small island with a canoe,

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,800
Speaker 6:  Did she initially pitch like a bigger island?

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,560
Speaker 4:  Well, no. Well, okay. First of all, I'm your friend Eli. That's Alex Kranz.

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,640
Speaker 4:  Hi, David Pierce is here.

24
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,560
Speaker 5:  Hi, I live on the dynamic island. It's a, it's a mindset more than a real

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Speaker 5:  island, but Joanna found the real island.

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,560
Speaker 4:  Her video producer obviously brought a drone. Yeah, I think it's Kenny is

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,520
Speaker 4:  her video producer. I'm pretty sure he is one of me this video. And so her

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,440
Speaker 4:  point was that the island gets bigger and smaller with the tide. And so they

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,040
Speaker 4:  have the video. Wow. The tide making the island bigger and smaller.

30
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,600
Speaker 4:  Just like the dynamic island on the phone.

31
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,640
Speaker 6:  I love this so

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,880
Speaker 4:  Much, which is, is just very good. It's a very good joke. It

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,680
Speaker 5:  Also straight up would be an apple thing to do to make the dynamic island

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,760
Speaker 5:  slightly smaller with the tides, like, like a localized dynamic

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,600
Speaker 5:  island that like changes colors as the sunsets and rises.

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:06,920
Speaker 5:  You can

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,320
Speaker 6:  Always know the tides. Yeah. Looking at your phone.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,320
Speaker 5:  Whatever happened to that Steven Spielberg show that was only supposed to

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,080
Speaker 5:  be available at night on apple TV. Do you guys remember

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,360
Speaker 4:  This? No, that was on quibi though. It

41
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,000
Speaker 5:  Was on quibi. Okay. That makes more sense.

42
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,760
Speaker 4:  Okay. And they never built the technology to do it WMP but he was

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,680
Speaker 4:  like, I made a horror show. And so you have to watch it at night and it's

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,600
Speaker 4:  like, yeah, that's

45
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,320
Speaker 5:  On your phone

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,760
Speaker 4:  Constantly turning your phone. And they announced it was such fanfare.

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,040
Speaker 4:  Oh

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,200
Speaker 4:  Yes. Right. It's like the show is only available in the middle and it was

50
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,040
Speaker 4:  very much like that's how a lot of TV worked for quite a

51
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,720
Speaker 4:  long time actually was we only watch on at night

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,240
Speaker 4:  for 30 minutes once a week,

53
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,920
Speaker 5:  Put that show in the dynamic island is what I'm saying. That's that's where

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,800
Speaker 4:  Quibi goes. Yeah, no. If apple did the tide sensor thing, they, they would

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,600
Speaker 4:  be like, we have built a custom array of tide sensing

56
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,760
Speaker 4:  robots,

57
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,920
Speaker 7:  Monitors

58
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,760
Speaker 4:  The coast of California. And that is constantly in

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,520
Speaker 4:  a very privacy respecting way. Constantly beaming tight information to your

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:08,720
Speaker 4:  phone

61
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,240
Speaker 4:  all. So a lot time this week, indeed, we

62
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,080
Speaker 4:  reviewed the iPhones 14. We also have, he

63
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,720
Speaker 4:  reviewed the apple watch series eight Iowas 16 is out David

64
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,880
Speaker 4:  reviewed that Sony brought out the place in shin VR, two

65
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,840
Speaker 4:  Google canceled, more stuff. We also, our new website

66
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,480
Speaker 4:  launched, which we did a whole podcast about that came out yesterday, but

67
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,560
Speaker 4:  it's like two days later, three days later told news it's happened on Tuesday.

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,440
Speaker 4:  I'm very tired.

69
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,720
Speaker 5:  You've also been talking about the website nonstop for, I mean, as long as

70
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,640
Speaker 5:  I've been at the verge and potentially much longer than that.

71
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

72
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,960
Speaker 5:  Do you want to talk more about the website? How are you on website talk?

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,200
Speaker 4:  Here's what I'll say. So the podcast David made with me and the Tara

74
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,280
Speaker 4:  and Matt from our product team, we did that like before it went out.

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,960
Speaker 4:  So like, what I will say is now the things out, I think we have a lot of

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,840
Speaker 4:  people who make products in our audience. You have no idea how it's gonna

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,560
Speaker 4:  go. Right. You just have to, like, I've been looking at this website for

78
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,240
Speaker 4:  six months. I've been reading our site exclusively in these designs for like

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,160
Speaker 4:  two months. And you know, the first wave of feedback to everything is

80
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,760
Speaker 4:  like, fuck you change it back. Like, that's just the way life goes. Yeah.

81
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,960
Speaker 4:  And so we were expecting it and we certainly got that. And I think those

82
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,720
Speaker 4:  people tend to amplify one another, especially on Twitter, the social

83
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,560
Speaker 4:  network that I'm trying to escape with our new design. So if you're

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,240
Speaker 4:  tweeting at me, change it back, I can just get your headlines on Twitter.

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,160
Speaker 4:  It's like, yeah. I mean, I'm, that is the dynamic

86
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,400
Speaker 4:  I am fighting against. I'm fighting against the hostility of this platform.

87
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,240
Speaker 4:  We are together as a family on the flip side, you know, a couple days later,

88
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,480
Speaker 4:  we're starting to get way more notes. I'm getting notes in my emails. I'm

89
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,080
Speaker 4:  getting notes on Twitter or we're getting notes across our team. It's starting

90
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,280
Speaker 4:  to click for people. So like you can open us first thing in the morning

91
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,640
Speaker 4:  and see a bunch of cool stuff. And you can check us once at night

92
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,600
Speaker 4:  and see a bunch of cool stuff. Yep. And that's like, yeah,

93
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,080
Speaker 4:  we didn't, we, we didn't get it. Right. We don't think it's perfect. It's

94
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,960
Speaker 4:  not done. We should change some things. And we will like, that's

95
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,400
Speaker 4:  like how it's gonna go. And I, here's what I will say to you, to everyone.

96
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,640
Speaker 4:  Apple made you use iOS seven for one year.

97
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,640
Speaker 4:  They're gonna ship stage manager to a lot of people

98
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,240
Speaker 4:  and it's gonna be like that for one year. Like we're gonna change

99
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,800
Speaker 4:  our site faster than that. So just like breathe,

100
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,480
Speaker 4:  we wanted to try some things. Some of our site is like the

101
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,080
Speaker 4:  most cutting edge web development you can do.

102
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,040
Speaker 4:  And maybe it's a little too cutting edge. Maybe we need to back it down a

103
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,000
Speaker 4:  couple steps. But the main thing, which is did I just publish

104
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,680
Speaker 4:  the tube filter top 50 that I look at once a week

105
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,760
Speaker 4:  to our site in five seconds and point out that the number of

106
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,400
Speaker 4:  channels in the top 50 that are primarily YouTube shorts channels keeps

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,720
Speaker 4:  growing every week. And then that was done in four minutes. And I got to

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,520
Speaker 4:  share our audience with tube filter, which is a great resource and not

109
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,280
Speaker 4:  have to overdo it and have that be on our, yeah, I got to do that. And like,

110
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,200
Speaker 4:  if we can just do that a little bit more and make it

111
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,080
Speaker 4:  valuable for people to check one more time a day and not have the toxicity

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,800
Speaker 4:  of social media, I think we're gonna be fine. And so, yeah, we're gonna tweak

113
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,640
Speaker 4:  the colors and fix the breakers. And if we're gonna do all the things we're

114
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,160
Speaker 4:  gonna keep blurple blurple is deeply important to a lot of people blurple

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Speaker 4:  is extremely, you know, but the here's what I think the main thing we have

116
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,720
Speaker 4:  to change is people keep saying there's too many fonts.

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,480
Speaker 4:  There's only three fonts. What you are really reacting to is that the

118
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,400
Speaker 4:  display of regular articles and the display of the quick posts

119
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,320
Speaker 4:  are too different. So we actually just need to make them look more the same.

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,000
Speaker 4:  And I that's like a pretty easy change, but we have to do it. But like, I

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,720
Speaker 4:  think once you make that change and it's just, there's more visual consistency,

122
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,440
Speaker 4:  I think we're gonna be fun.

123
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I will say the thing that's been the most fun for me the last few

124
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,440
Speaker 5:  days is like way more of our slack

125
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,560
Speaker 5:  is now on our website, which I think is very cool. Like I, I went on vacation

126
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,520
Speaker 5:  in August and I got yelled at for being in slack. And I realized one of the

127
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,480
Speaker 5:  reasons I keep opening slack is because we have this channel called goods

128
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Speaker 5:  tweet because I think there's just to be one called good tweets. That's now

129
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Speaker 5:  dead. So now there's one called goods tweet. And there's just like a

130
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,840
Speaker 5:  long running list of like funny tweets in that channel. And I

131
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Speaker 5:  literally check it on purpose because I like it. And it makes me happy. And

132
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,040
Speaker 5:  it's like, we've just built venues to put that stuff on our website, which

133
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Speaker 5:  was the point it's like, our job is to like see cool stuff on the internet.

134
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,280
Speaker 5:  And we want to give you more of it in public. And people are just having

135
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,240
Speaker 5:  a blast with it. It's just so much fun to do. It's great. Yeah.

136
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,880
Speaker 4:  It's just, it's fun for our staff to be a part of our community and

137
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,600
Speaker 4:  doing it on other people's platforms seems self defeating.

138
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,160
Speaker 4:  So we are gonna try to do it on our own and yes, that's a big change and

139
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,120
Speaker 4:  yes, the whole site, isn't just a list of headlines anymore. But we, we think

140
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,960
Speaker 4:  this is a, like, there are so many ways to get lists of our headlines.

141
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,240
Speaker 4:  Like infinite, you can build custom RSS feeds for days. There's a

142
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,200
Speaker 4:  page on our website. That is one decade old. We'll put a link

143
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,280
Speaker 4:  in the show notes about how to build custom RSS feeds outta the verge. It

144
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,920
Speaker 4:  all still works. Yeah. We've been committed to RSS for one, if you are

145
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,760
Speaker 4:  listening to this show, you know that we've been committed to RSS at a DNA

146
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,600
Speaker 4:  level for like one decade and we're gonna keep doing it. And we're making

147
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,400
Speaker 4:  RSS feed for quick, all the stuff. If you want those views, you can get them.

148
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,880
Speaker 4:  You can just follow us on Twitter. We just tweet all the headlines every

149
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,760
Speaker 4:  day, but we're gonna try something else on our own platform. So like I said,

150
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,720
Speaker 4:  we'll iterate. I'm more pleased. We made everybody talk about a

151
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,600
Speaker 4:  website in 2022. Yeah. That's like the spiritual victory of making

152
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,840
Speaker 4:  everybody talk about a website in 2022 is very high. The

153
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,760
Speaker 4:  reacting to the complaints about people wanting the website to be more like

154
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,640
Speaker 4:  a direct injection RSS feed to the brain. Fine.

155
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,880
Speaker 4:  But like, I'm, I'm happy that people are reconsidering the value of the web

156
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,840
Speaker 4:  in 2022. We've we've accomplished our first.

157
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,680
Speaker 5:  And if you read the verge on a 40 inch ultra wide monitor, and you think

158
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,520
Speaker 5:  that the column of the verge is too small, please just know that we hear

159
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,440
Speaker 5:  you because we all have giant weird, crazy monitors too. And we hear you.

160
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
Speaker 5:  Most people use cell phones

161
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,240
Speaker 6:  Like half our staff has like the ultra wides.

162
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,240
Speaker 6:  Sean Hollister has like his, his monitor is as big as his desk.

163
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,440
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

164
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,840
Speaker 5:  What does it look like on the, on the, that crazy Samsung thing? That's

165
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,320
Speaker 5:  11 feet tall. Oh

166
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Speaker 4:  My gosh. It's the vertical curve and the one, it looks great, man. That's

167
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,480
Speaker 4:  just a verge hugging. Yes.

168
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,120
Speaker 6:  Like that's what it's built for. They actually built it for us. That's a

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,240
Speaker 4:  Surprise. We started with the, the two use. We start what we St. We

170
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,920
Speaker 4:  shipped a product, right? Like we started with the phone view port, cuz that's

171
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,640
Speaker 4:  most people. And we did like this standard laptop view port, cuz that's almost

172
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,400
Speaker 4:  everybody else we'll get there.

173
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,040
Speaker 6:  Where's my EIN view and my iPad view.

174
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,240
Speaker 6:  That's

175
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,840
Speaker 4:  All I want. I'm just saying I, I, apple needs to use iOS seven for one year.

176
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Just take a breath. We're gonna be fine.

177
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,720
Speaker 4:  All right. Speaking of apple phones, we have phones a

178
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,600
Speaker 5:  Lot. Yeah. You reviewed the pro, which I feel like is like clearly the most

179
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,240
Speaker 5:  interesting of the phones. Like we didn't review the plus. Yeah.

180
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,600
Speaker 4:  Allison's review of the iPhone. 14 was very much. It's very funny. You should

181
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,360
Speaker 4:  watch it. It's very good.

182
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,560
Speaker 6:  Her video is extremely good.

183
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean it's the same phone. Yeah. Only now

184
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,880
Speaker 4:  you can tell you if you're in a car crash,

185
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,800
Speaker 5:  It's even more the same phone than I realized. Like the, the thing I at

186
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,160
Speaker 5:  least hoped was that in the camera in particular, some of the like little

187
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,760
Speaker 5:  upgrades would add up to something and it kind of sounds like they barely

188
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,880
Speaker 5:  do. It's like very much in the vein of if your

189
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,800
Speaker 5:  phone is dying and you need a new one, this is probably the one to buy.

190
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,960
Speaker 5:  If your phone is not dying and you don't need one, don't buy this one and

191
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,920
Speaker 4:  Keep your phone. I think the iPhone 14 is

192
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,480
Speaker 4:  indicative of the fact that maybe there are no more people

193
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Speaker 4:  without cell phones.

194
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,640
Speaker 6:  Tell me more.

195
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,080
Speaker 5:  Certainly not who might buy iPhones.

196
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,960
Speaker 4:  Right? Like Apple's entire game now. And if you just look at the pricing

197
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,920
Speaker 4:  of these phones, right. It's yeah. The, I know the 14 propri,

198
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,960
Speaker 4:  they start a thousand dollars and the big one is 10 99. Right. But

199
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,120
Speaker 4:  then the carrier subsidies are outta control. It's just, they're totally

200
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,480
Speaker 4:  dependent on the carriers now, cuz the carriers are all in two year upgrade

201
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,320
Speaker 4:  cycles. They really want you to upgrade those phones. Cuz you'll sign another

202
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,360
Speaker 4:  two years of 5g service. For whatever reason you might wanna do such a thing.

203
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,960
Speaker 4:  Like apple has created a world in which

204
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,960
Speaker 4:  most people who are gonna have iPhones have their iPhones and they yep. They

205
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,840
Speaker 4:  need to be competitive and compete with Android and conquest those users.

206
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,320
Speaker 4:  But that huge installed base. If they can just turn them regularly,

207
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,280
Speaker 4:  they're gonna sell a lot of phones.

208
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,220
Speaker 5:  Well, and it's almost like the, the incentive to make it dramatically better

209
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,140
Speaker 5:  every year in for those people is almost going away because now it's

210
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,660
Speaker 5:  like, you're gonna keep your phone until you need to upgrade for one reason

211
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,060
Speaker 5:  or another. And then you're just gonna upgrade to whatever the new one is.

212
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,020
Speaker 5:  So the, the thing where apple has to like ship something

213
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,780
Speaker 5:  spectacularly new every year, because that's the upgrade path for people

214
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,340
Speaker 5:  is just gone.

215
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,800
Speaker 6:  How many people is that upgrade path for though? Like the

216
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,720
Speaker 6:  ones who are doing it year annually. I know a lot of people on our staff

217
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,800
Speaker 6:  do and probably a lot of our listeners are doing the annual, but I feel like

218
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,560
Speaker 6:  a lot of people are, are now just doing like three, four year upgrades. And

219
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,080
Speaker 6:  even then it's the same thing. Like I gotta wait until there's a reason to

220
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,440
Speaker 6:  upgrade. 5g was not a reason for a lot of those people.

221
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,560
Speaker 4:  I mean the carriers will happily lie to you. Tell you,

222
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Carriers will tell me differently. But

223
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,240
Speaker 5:  Your mom, Alex is on. If I remember correctly like an iPhone 10 R

224
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,960
Speaker 5:  right? Yes, yes. Your mom is gonna buy an iPhone 14 and

225
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,600
Speaker 5:  it's gonna be like magic. Right? Like it is going to,

226
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,240
Speaker 6:  She's not though. Cuz she watched Allison's video. So she's like, I guess

227
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,800
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna get a

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Speaker 5:  13. She gonna buy a pro oh she's gonna buy a 13. Even that we'll feel like

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,520
Speaker 5:  a huge upgrade. Right? Like the, the summation of these over the course of

230
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,440
Speaker 5:  three or four years is huge. Yeah. But each individual upgrade now

231
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,320
Speaker 5:  is

232
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,760
Speaker 6:  They're so iterative. Pretty

233
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,520
Speaker 5:  Minor. Yeah.

234
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean I held off I'm on an 11 pro my 14

235
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,080
Speaker 6:  pro is currently in Kentucky. I'm so excited for tomorrow. And

236
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,400
Speaker 6:  like I,

237
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,160
Speaker 4:  My understanding of your situation is that you live in New York and your

238
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,080
Speaker 4:  family is in Texas. Is it on its way to you in Kentucky?

239
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,560
Speaker 4:  Or has it

240
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,960
Speaker 6:  Stopped? Yes. Cause I just checked the ups tracking and it's like

241
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,640
Speaker 6:  landed in Kentucky.

242
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,400
Speaker 4:  I didn't know if you had like a burner house in Kentucky

243
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,960
Speaker 5:  Has a PO box in

244
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,080
Speaker 4:  Kentucky's just like I'm working in a elaborate tax scam.

245
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,880
Speaker 5:  It's technically my main residence. Well,

246
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,200
Speaker 6:  Not anymore. Like it's now everybody on the podcast

247
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,440
Speaker 6:  knows. Yeah.

248
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,520
Speaker 4:  The Kentucky state tax authorities are on the case. If you

249
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,560
Speaker 4:  work in, like, if you're a tax O instead of Kentucky, you're listening to

250
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,640
Speaker 4:  our chest. Let me know. I would just what's that like for you, we have

251
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,480
Speaker 5:  A lot of Alex information to tell you

252
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,120
Speaker 6:  Don't call them. Don't call them. It's

253
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,640
Speaker 4:  Fine. You're excited about the upgrade is the point of all this. Yeah.

254
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I like, I'm fairly excited about it cuz it's actually feels like, like

255
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,720
Speaker 6:  for me, the dynamic island was the moment where I was like, oh yeah, I'm

256
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,560
Speaker 6:  gonna upgrade for that. Oh cool. Which is probably very stupid. My sister

257
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,400
Speaker 6:  was like, who would upgrade for the dynamic island? And I was like, well

258
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,880
Speaker 6:  I did. I just bought a phone. Yeah. For it. I

259
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,000
Speaker 4:  Mean it it's, it's fun.

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And it feels like,

261
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,760
Speaker 4:  But I, but I think that the cycle is, has been two years and it is

262
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,680
Speaker 4:  stretching its way to four. Right. And you can kind of see that Apple's

263
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,840
Speaker 4:  slowing the pace of it or of updates. So year to year it's almost nothing.

264
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Right. Four years. It's massive. Yeah. It's and probably your battery

265
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,080
Speaker 4:  is shot. So you're like extremely excited that your phone's

266
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,520
Speaker 6:  Gone. That's the biggest part for me is I'm excited for my phone to last

267
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,360
Speaker 6:  more than four hours. Yeah. Well

268
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,840
Speaker 5:  Yes.

269
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,600
Speaker 6:  Four hours. Yeah.

270
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,920
Speaker 4:  So we've now dispensed with talking about the iPhone 14

271
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,160
Speaker 6:  And that's the iPhone

272
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,240
Speaker 4:  14. We actually talked about it all. Get the 13, the iPhone 14 exists to

273
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
Speaker 4:  be upgraded to it. It does not exist for any other like

274
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,480
Speaker 4:  meaningful reason. It just slow iterative updates and it it's there.

275
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,560
Speaker 4:  They cannot advertise the new 48 mango pixel camera. They can't

276
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,680
Speaker 4:  advertise a new chip

277
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,000
Speaker 6:  And 20 minute commercial trying to,

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They can't advertise a new design. They can't advertise the size of

279
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,280
Speaker 4:  the camera bump. What do they got? They got the island. And

280
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,760
Speaker 4:  it's like, oh, that's why they named it. The island. Yeah. Yeah. It it's

281
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,880
Speaker 4:  a great actually I've super come around to the name

282
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,480
Speaker 4:  because if you are me and you are walking the earth and people

283
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,360
Speaker 4:  are like, what do you think of the dynamic island? You're like, let me tell

284
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,000
Speaker 4:  you about notifications and status alerts and smartphone operating systems.

285
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,240
Speaker 4:  And you're like, this is, this is actually how I want to connect with people.

286
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This is, this is the bond that will bring us together. Is your new

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,960
Speaker 4:  found interest in smartphone alerts. And then I look up and they, they have

288
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,320
Speaker 4:  been running for minutes.

289
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,960
Speaker 4:  They've the distance between us has grown so immensely,

290
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,680
Speaker 4:  but their little pixel phone. But that's why I have this community. Yeah.

291
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,400
Speaker 4:  So that's the 14, right? I think it is just a very iterative updated it's

292
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,320
Speaker 4:  designed to capture that group of iPhone 11 owners who are it's time to

293
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,520
Speaker 4:  upgrade. And I think all those people be very happy. Yeah. If you have an

294
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,840
Speaker 4:  iPhone 13, just like stay away. And actually I think the iPhone 13

295
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,760
Speaker 4:  in particularly the iPhone 13 pro you can get it on sale

296
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,640
Speaker 4:  tremend upgrade target. It might be actually a superior upgrade target

297
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,440
Speaker 4:  than either the 14 or the 14 pro. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Like if you

298
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Speaker 4:  have an iPhone 11 and you can like get one of those on sale. Whew. That's

299
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,960
Speaker 4:  a good idea. Right. It's like a very complete phone and this is really the

300
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,800
Speaker 4:  point. This was my review of the, the 14 pro the iPhone 13

301
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,160
Speaker 4:  is complete. It is a finished thought. Yep.

302
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,240
Speaker 4:  And Indeed's review of it last year. He was like, there's not a lot here

303
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,520
Speaker 4:  to say. Right. And like, you kind of, yeah, they did the thing. Yeah. And

304
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,320
Speaker 4:  you kind of end up reviewing iOS. Yeah. Right. At like a basic level.

305
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,640
Speaker 4:  And that's like, you know, it's apple, it's hardware and software and services.

306
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,280
Speaker 4:  And that did a, you know, like Tim cook who got speech, but as a product,

307
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,240
Speaker 4:  as a finished product with melds hardware and software, it was just

308
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,920
Speaker 4:  not a lot of rough edges to the iPhone 13 pro yeah. You can

309
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,840
Speaker 4:  criticize the camera in some little way. Like all this stuff, whatever. It

310
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,760
Speaker 4:  didn't have an always on display. It's like all this, they didn't have a

311
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,480
Speaker 4:  bunch of Android features basically. But the 14 pro they've added and always

312
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,000
Speaker 4:  on display, they've added the satellite thing. They've added the island.

313
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,120
Speaker 4:  All those things are like wildly unfinished. The, the 48

314
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,200
Speaker 4:  megapixel camera is new. So you're like, Apple's now in the beginning of

315
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,960
Speaker 4:  this new path. And you're like, oh, I can see all the rough

316
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Speaker 4:  edges. I can see all the things they didn't add. I can see all the, the ideas

317
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,120
Speaker 4:  they didn't complete or what they left off to ship this one. And that's like

318
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,920
Speaker 4:  pretty exciting at the same time. It's also like, boy,

319
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,280
Speaker 4:  there's a lot to criticize you.

320
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well, and I guess what I wonder with, with the 14 pro and

321
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,240
Speaker 5:  even still wonder kind of after reading your review is like, is there a

322
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,160
Speaker 5:  long road towards something really cool here? Or are we gonna get to the

323
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,840
Speaker 5:  iPhone 15? They're gonna like Polish all those things. And then we're gonna

324
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,480
Speaker 5:  be back to thinking like, okay, they, more or less finished this

325
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,760
Speaker 5:  medium interesting thing they were trying

326
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,720
Speaker 4:  To do. I think I have take it in chunks. Okay. So the

327
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,400
Speaker 4:  island, I think we won't know if it's awesome or if it's

328
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,400
Speaker 4:  3d touch part two until next year, right? Like straight

329
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,280
Speaker 4:  up the live activities, API has to ship, which is turning

330
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,040
Speaker 4:  into a huge deal for apple, right? This like background, task, live activities,

331
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,200
Speaker 4:  API that they put, they're doing Iowa 16, which we

332
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,600
Speaker 4:  saw when we saw it at WWC. I think David and I broke like, oh, that could

333
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,480
Speaker 4:  be a whole thing, but it is the foundation of the dynamic island. So

334
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,760
Speaker 4:  all the thing, all the concepts they showed from flighty and Lyft and all

335
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,880
Speaker 4:  that, like they all need to use it. It's

336
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,920
Speaker 5:  The sand underneath the dynamic.

337
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah. What's what are islands made of? It's

338
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,160
Speaker 6:  The volcanic rock. It's

339
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,440
Speaker 4:  Sand

340
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,760
Speaker 5:  Volcanic rock. There you go. It's the dormant volcano underneath.

341
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,920
Speaker 5:  No, but I think, and the interesting thing is I've been talking to a bunch

342
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,000
Speaker 5:  of developers about this, and there's still very much a sense of like

343
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,360
Speaker 5:  uncertainty about the best way to use this stuff.

344
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,040
Speaker 5:  So I think you're gonna see a lot of folks try stuff and

345
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,960
Speaker 5:  roll things out that are live or aren't live that make use of

346
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,920
Speaker 5:  the island. And I, there's a lot of open questions about

347
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,760
Speaker 5:  not like whether this can be cool, but what it looks like when it is

348
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,520
Speaker 5:  cool, that I think is like, to your point, gonna take a while to shake out

349
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,440
Speaker 5:  and especially with the live activities. And I think it's true on the island

350
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,400
Speaker 5:  too. Like it's, it's coming for you. It's not a thing. You get a lot of control

351
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,240
Speaker 5:  over. Like if you're gonna have notifications on, you're also gonna get live

352
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,920
Speaker 5:  activities. So I think figuring out sort of where that pendulum

353
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,800
Speaker 5:  should stop before it's like super annoying and in your face all

354
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,360
Speaker 5:  the time is gonna take a minute.

355
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So here's one that we couldn't review cuz the live of activities, API

356
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,560
Speaker 4:  hasn't shipped, there are no apps that use it. Like right now in our video,

357
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,480
Speaker 4:  in every video, every demo of the island, what do people do? They start the

358
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,160
Speaker 4:  music player and that flies up to the island. And then they open a timer

359
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,480
Speaker 4:  and the island splits into beautiful. Like the, the classic,

360
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,920
Speaker 5:  The clock app is the most innovative app on the iPhone. Like prove me wrong.

361
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,560
Speaker 5:  It's it's the one.

362
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,000
Speaker 4:  But that makes sense. And there's an internal priority system in iOS

363
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,440
Speaker 4:  that says the music player is more important than the

364
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,200
Speaker 4:  timer. Oh, so the timer's gonna go in this little circle and the music

365
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,120
Speaker 4:  player's gonna be the big one. If you then make a phone call, iOS

366
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,880
Speaker 4:  is like, actually the phone call is the most important thing and we'll kick

367
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,200
Speaker 4:  the music player. We'll stop it. We're gonna stop your music while you're

368
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,040
Speaker 4:  playing a phone call and timers it. So like there's this internal priority

369
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,960
Speaker 4:  system that apple has developed, who knows, right? Like when you

370
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
Speaker 4:  add Uber to that mix who wins right. Will Uber

371
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,520
Speaker 4:  respect said priority system? When you add sports

372
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,360
Speaker 4:  scores to that mix, who knows like there are millions of

373
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,680
Speaker 4:  kinds of these live activities. Is

374
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,120
Speaker 6:  Apple handling that or is that gonna be up to the developers? Is it gonna

375
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,640
Speaker 6:  be up to the, the users seems like a terrible idea for it to be up to the

376
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,040
Speaker 6:  developers.

377
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,120
Speaker 4:  So it's not up to the users as far as I know. So apple has this priority

378
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,000
Speaker 4:  system. Yeah. You don't like assign yourself

379
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,880
Speaker 4:  like a five. Yeah. I think they've ranked basically the

380
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,400
Speaker 4:  APIs.

381
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. My app's not very important.

382
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,360
Speaker 4:  I mean, that's what they did on Android. Right. Notifications on Android

383
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,800
Speaker 4:  have priority levels and the developers basically pick their priority levels

384
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,840
Speaker 4:  and everyone picks like the top priority. Yeah.

385
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,080
Speaker 6:  They're like, I'm the most important

386
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,560
Speaker 4:  Surprise. It's true on iOS too time. You need to know what's new on Netflix,

387
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,160
Speaker 4:  right? Yeah. Apple has time sensitive notifications and like half of my

388
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,880
Speaker 4:  notifications are marked time sensitive because developers like, of course

389
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,840
Speaker 4:  this is time sensitive.

390
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,040
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It seems like a terrible idea to give the developers any control over

391
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Speaker 6:  that because they, well,

392
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,360
Speaker 4:  This is where I think Apple's control of the app store for better or worse

393
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,680
Speaker 4:  comes into play. Like they're gonna pay a lot of attention to how this thing

394
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,360
Speaker 4:  is being used. So, you know, here's a question are, what if developers just

395
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,400
Speaker 4:  start putting ads in the dynamic island? It's a thing you could reasonably

396
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,120
Speaker 4:  do. Right. Like

397
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,640
Speaker 6:  I throw my phone out the window,

398
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,680
Speaker 4:  You're near a McDonald's and McDonald's is like, boo, boo, like

399
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:27,000
Speaker 4:  stop in for some French fry. Like you can see it coming. Yeah.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,880
Speaker 4:  Right. And like, I think Apple's ability to police its platform. And

401
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,760
Speaker 4:  I think perhaps more importantly, it's absolute willingness to police its

402
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,720
Speaker 4:  platform is gonna come through here. So there's just this part of it.

403
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,680
Speaker 4:  I can't review yet. Yeah. Right. Cause that huge ecosystem of experiments

404
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,360
Speaker 4:  has not actually begun. Then the part you're you can review is like, you're

405
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,600
Speaker 4:  just like using your phone and it's like, oh, I'm not supposed to use this.

406
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,700
Speaker 4:  Like it's just background stuff. Like

407
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,620
Speaker 4:  I'm what I'm supposed to do. My iPhone is use apps. Yeah. Like there's not

408
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,470
Speaker 4:  really a world in which you're

409
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,710
Speaker 4:  like using the maps app to navigate

410
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,150
Speaker 6:  Via the island and

411
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,390
Speaker 4:  You open another app.

412
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,030
Speaker 4:  Right? Like how often does this happen to you?

413
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,030
Speaker 4:  It's very rare. There's a world in which you have the map app up and the

414
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,190
Speaker 4:  phone call comes in and like that little thing is fine, but just like sort

415
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,710
Speaker 4:  of the opening round is like, oh yeah, it's the music. It's phone calls.

416
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,790
Speaker 4:  It's the timer. That's what I really want there. And kind of everything else

417
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,070
Speaker 4:  is just like a, a demo.

418
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,230
Speaker 6:  You kind of compared it to 3d touch earlier. But I feel like it's more

419
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,990
Speaker 6:  adjacent to, I'm sorry to everyone besides me who loved it,

420
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,030
Speaker 6:  the touch bar

421
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,590
Speaker 4:  That's

422
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,190
Speaker 6:  Rude. Like I feel like it's that same. And, and, and I, I wonder if like

423
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,750
Speaker 6:  the touch bar part of its failure was that like apple and

424
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,230
Speaker 6:  developers had very little interest in it. Like developers didn't do a lot

425
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,390
Speaker 6:  with it. Apple did like three things and it was like, yep, there it is. And

426
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,270
Speaker 6:  there was no, nothing more happened with it. Is this

427
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,430
Speaker 6:  different? Like, is this gonna be different?

428
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,430
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think it's, I think it's different. I hope so. The, the,

429
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,070
Speaker 4:  the problem with the touch bar is like apple replaced a set of

430
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,910
Speaker 4:  good and useful buttons. Right. That had been on computers for

431
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,870
Speaker 4:  1000 years. Yep. With like, so you don't need this idea. And it was like

432
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,910
Speaker 4:  not useful. And I was like hard to use and whatever this is like, all right.

433
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,750
Speaker 4:  There was a notch, which you basically didn't see. I know some people

434
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,630
Speaker 4:  claim to be able to see it. And now there's this thing that you definitely

435
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,350
Speaker 4:  see because it is always moving, like stuff is happening up there all the

436
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,190
Speaker 4:  time. And it's like, you gotta pay for that. Right. You gotta make that so

437
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,950
Speaker 4:  useful. It's worth it to be there in your face all the time. Yeah.

438
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,630
Speaker 4:  I always think about things in terms of cost. Right? So like the first apple

439
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,390
Speaker 4:  watch to me was not worth it because the cost of having to care for its little

440
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,030
Speaker 4:  battery was like too high. Yeah. Like you was always charging it. And like,

441
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,480
Speaker 4:  like didn't do a lot. And it was pretty slow and it was like, oh, I'm putting

442
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,920
Speaker 4:  more into this than getting out of it. The notch was like a great

443
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,000
Speaker 4:  value proposition. It took away a little bit of screen, but it added face

444
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,080
Speaker 4:  ID. And like after a day you're like, I'm not even looking at this thing

445
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,840
Speaker 4:  anymore. Yeah. Now I face ID. This is like, they've made it more prominent.

446
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,200
Speaker 4:  It's in your face. You're looking at it. You kind of want to use it.

447
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,440
Speaker 4:  And it doesn't do a lot yet. Like it is legitimately cool

448
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,440
Speaker 4:  that the airdrop indicator is in there. It's cool. Like that's just

449
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,200
Speaker 4:  neat. Yeah.

450
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,760
Speaker 5:  I do think you might be underrating the widget

451
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,840
Speaker 5:  access from other apps that like, I, to

452
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,560
Speaker 5:  me, it's like the closest thing we've ever had to like persistent

453
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,360
Speaker 5:  playback controls on an iPhone, which I would argue if done

454
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,960
Speaker 5:  really well is like hugely useful. Yeah. There was a tweet

455
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,600
Speaker 5:  somebody did the other day. That was basically like, after looking at the

456
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,400
Speaker 5:  dynamic island, they never noticed that your phone doesn't tell you what

457
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,320
Speaker 5:  you're listening to as you're using it. It just has, there's just audio playing.

458
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,360
Speaker 5:  There's no sort of latent information about it unless you go looking for

459
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,680
Speaker 5:  it in one way or another. And I've spent a bunch of time thinking like, is

460
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,520
Speaker 5:  it, is that actually a thing I want, if I'm like listening to music, do I

461
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,480
Speaker 5:  need it? Like ticker scrolling the song I have on at all times? Like probably

462
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,000
Speaker 5:  not. But do I want access to playback without having to

463
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,920
Speaker 5:  do three or four other things? Like, yes, that strikes me as really useful.

464
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,040
Speaker 4:  But you did you just swipe down, you get like the widgets on the

465
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,440
Speaker 4:  notification center. Yeah.

466
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,160
Speaker 5:  But the like,

467
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,480
Speaker 4:  Or it's in a control center,

468
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,080
Speaker 5:  The control center thing sucks. I will, I will control center is

469
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,280
Speaker 5:  useless and I will not stand for anyone telling me control center is good.

470
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,400
Speaker 4:  Okay. But so then here's, but here's my push back to you. You have to tap

471
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,200
Speaker 4:  and hold. Yeah.

472
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,240
Speaker 5:  You want it to just be the one tap to get there.

473
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,760
Speaker 4:  You just tap it and open it. Since we published that take, like, I've heard

474
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,640
Speaker 4:  arguments, like some apps won't have it, you know, like they won't have a

475
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,960
Speaker 4:  widget. You'll just like, go back there anyway. Like, okay, fine. What, like,

476
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,560
Speaker 4:  what is the appropriate widget for like, I don't know the stocks app. It's

477
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,200
Speaker 4:  just like take you to the stocks app makes a dynamic island widget. Like

478
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,560
Speaker 4:  we're all doomed. Like we financialize too much of our lives.

479
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,680
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I, the, the widget part of it is really cool.

480
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,240
Speaker 4:  Like that's actually the coolest part of it is because they, to your point,

481
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,920
Speaker 4:  it's like always on playback controls. They have made it look like a screen

482
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,560
Speaker 4:  that gets bigger with this sub pixel anti aliasing.

483
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,520
Speaker 4:  Right. It's very crisp. And it like opens very cool. And all the

484
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,800
Speaker 4:  animations are cool. Like that's the way to think about it. Like, you've

485
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,680
Speaker 4:  got a secondary display on your iPhone. Now that lives way, way

486
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,840
Speaker 4:  over the top of the system.

487
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,400
Speaker 6:  Like a touch bar, like

488
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Speaker 4:  A touch bar. And it just,

489
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,040
Speaker 6:  It is a bar that you touch. Sure.

490
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,160
Speaker 4:  I just, it doesn't, they didn't take away the escape key on the

491
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,480
Speaker 4:  keyboard, like right. It's the cost. Isn't that high. Yeah.

492
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,280
Speaker 6:  They added like, it would've been like if the touch bar had been above the

493
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,240
Speaker 6:  function key bar and instead,

494
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,640
Speaker 5:  No, it would've been like if apple had replaced the dock on your Mac with

495
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,800
Speaker 5:  a touch bar, like that's functionally, what's going on here. It's like a,

496
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,840
Speaker 5:  it's a space you kind of use that is still a software space that they're

497
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,320
Speaker 5:  turning into something different.

498
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,720
Speaker 6:  I'm just thinking about that. And like trying to swipe across the bottom

499
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,920
Speaker 6:  of my monitor. That's gross, but

500
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,520
Speaker 4:  Look on face right now. Incredible.

501
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,360
Speaker 6:  Ugh. No, thank you. Absolutely not.

502
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So look, we'll like, that's my big, this is what I mean. So the first

503
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,520
Speaker 4:  bucket is like a year from now. We'll be able to confidently

504
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,120
Speaker 4:  evaluate the dynamic island. Yeah. Right now what I can, I'm just telling

505
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,680
Speaker 4:  you, the trade off is a little bit upside down. Like it's more in your face.

506
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,720
Speaker 4:  If you, I run my phone in light mode, it covers up the content. You can

507
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,880
Speaker 4:  see it's just a black pill on top of your display all the time in a way that

508
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,760
Speaker 4:  the notch, because there was no bright contrast at the top of the

509
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,680
Speaker 4:  notch. It was easy to ignore. But now there's screen at the top

510
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,360
Speaker 4:  too. So you can just like, see it glowing and it moves. So you're like, look

511
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,320
Speaker 4:  at it all time. It's worth it. Is it cool? Do people wanna talk to me about

512
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,400
Speaker 4:  status indicators on the phone? They do. I love

513
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,520
Speaker 5:  It. Alex, do you use dark mode or light mode?

514
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,480
Speaker 6:  I am a dark mode, like avid religious believer.

515
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's like full, crazy to me that you use your phone on light mode,

516
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,040
Speaker 5:  Eli like that is it it's it's do you just turn on your phone

517
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,520
Speaker 5:  at night and it blinds you to

518
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,280
Speaker 4:  Death? Well, based on tweets about our redesign, I am not the only one.

519
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,440
Speaker 6:  I mean, we have some, some light mode lovers

520
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,000
Speaker 6:  also@theverge.com.

521
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,720
Speaker 5:  I mean, I too love to be blinded by my phone. Every time I turn it on.

522
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,320
Speaker 5:  It's great.

523
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,960
Speaker 6:  It's like, it's upsetting to me. I have like a white screen on me right now

524
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,680
Speaker 6:  and it's giving me great lighting on one side of my face. And that's the

525
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,720
Speaker 6:  only reason for light mode.

526
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,480
Speaker 4:  Okay. So that was the first bucket a year from now. The second bucket is

527
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,800
Speaker 4:  like, who knows?

528
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,480
Speaker 4:  Well, the other thing I put in the year from now bucket would be the camera.

529
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

530
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,590
Speaker 5:  Really? Why,

531
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,590
Speaker 6:  Why would you put that in the year from now bucket? Cause it feels a little

532
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,190
Speaker 6:  like apart from the sharpness issues you had, it felt pretty

533
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,590
Speaker 6:  complete in your review.

534
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,910
Speaker 5:  And this is like an old idea. Apple did not like invent a new

535
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,270
Speaker 5:  theory about photography here. It just pixel bins.

536
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,550
Speaker 4:  Right. And then like, so what you get out of it is that the sensor is much

537
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,350
Speaker 4:  bigger. So you get a little bit better blur like Boca and the photos,

538
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,310
Speaker 4:  which is nice. Not so much that like you have

539
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,950
Speaker 4:  to like, go look for it and then it's there. And it's a very, it is very

540
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,750
Speaker 4:  nice, but it's not so much more than 13. Yeah. And you get a little bit better

541
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,270
Speaker 4:  lowlight performance, you do get better find detail, but that find detail

542
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,110
Speaker 4:  comes with a bunch of sharpening. You're just not getting this a

543
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,470
Speaker 4:  year from now. I think apple will be more confident in how to use this sensor.

544
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,710
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Right. I think right now they played it pretty safe and they're, they're

545
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,390
Speaker 4:  not pushing it. And I'm just telling whoever

546
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,150
Speaker 4:  from apple is listening to this. Like the photo processing is getting

547
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,990
Speaker 4:  too aggressive, like the combo platter of noise reduction and

548
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,430
Speaker 4:  sharpening that is occurring on the iPhone right now is like just getting

549
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,510
Speaker 4:  weird, like too much, like back it off.

550
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,990
Speaker 5:  It is the side by sides of particularly the

551
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,670
Speaker 5:  14 pro and the pixel six were pretty

552
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,110
Speaker 5:  wild. Just that it's like, and you even say this in the review, it's like,

553
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,030
Speaker 5:  these are two photos of ostensibly the same thing that just

554
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,800
Speaker 5:  have wildly different opinions about what a good photo is

555
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,120
Speaker 5:  supposed to be. And you can look at them both. And they're both pretty good

556
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,840
Speaker 5:  photos. It's like, this is in incredibly bad lighting. And it's,

557
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,240
Speaker 5:  it's a relatively like sharp, nice looking photo, but it is

558
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,640
Speaker 5:  stylistically like miles apart from each other. And it's,

559
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,560
Speaker 5:  it's wild. Like I've, it's, it's gotten so much more pronounced over

560
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,240
Speaker 5:  time. Samsung has this like very warm tone

561
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,120
Speaker 5:  idea about the world where everything is like colorful and

562
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,720
Speaker 5:  smooth and beautiful Samsung

563
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,600
Speaker 4:  Phones are on a different planet. I don't know what else to say about this.

564
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,440
Speaker 4:  Like they're in a different dimension where everything is different color.

565
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:15,840
Speaker 4:  I

566
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,760
Speaker 5:  Kind of like the world, it lives in, it's a very like optimistic

567
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,920
Speaker 5:  universe that Samsung's phones live in, where everything is like beautiful.

568
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,960
Speaker 5:  And the sun is always setting.

569
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,520
Speaker 4:  So I, the last time I did an iPhone pro I didn't do last year, two years

570
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,440
Speaker 4:  ago, I did a 12 pros. And my takeaway that year was all these

571
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,800
Speaker 4:  phones are the same. They all look the same, like no differences exist.

572
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,600
Speaker 4:  And then this year they're as wildly different as they've ever been. I mean

573
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,560
Speaker 4:  like, and bright light when you like shoot a person on a city street. Like

574
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,840
Speaker 4:  that look exactly the same, but it's on the edges when they have to make

575
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,800
Speaker 4:  decisions. It's like, it's hard to even describe

576
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,680
Speaker 4:  like they're making artistic decisions that are wildly different from

577
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,160
Speaker 5:  Each other. Yeah. And the pixel is very sort of like neat and tidy. And then

578
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,560
Speaker 5:  apple is just like, let light range, see what happens.

579
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,840
Speaker 6:  It's like the dynamic range. Yeah.

580
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,160
Speaker 5:  It's

581
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,080
Speaker 6:  Nuts on the 14 pro versus the six, the, the pixel six

582
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,000
Speaker 6:  pro is, is incredible. Like you're looking, oh, I can like look into these

583
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,200
Speaker 6:  buildings on the pixel six pro. And I

584
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,640
Speaker 6:  simply know that there are buildings there with the iPhone.

585
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And they're very bright.

586
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Very brightly that up. You know, it's like other stuff like

587
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,640
Speaker 4:  apple, it does not appear. Apple spent a lot of time on portrait mode,

588
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,680
Speaker 4:  you know? And like Samsung is just a, even a baby S 22, not the S 22

589
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,480
Speaker 4:  ultra does better portrait mode segmentation of like, hair's the

590
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,200
Speaker 4:  bummer than the iPhone does now. Just like, there it is. And we actually

591
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,360
Speaker 4:  did that demo with the S 22, just cuz it's interesting to see that the

592
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,040
Speaker 4:  not pro Samsung phone is outperforming the, the iPhone 14 pro

593
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,120
Speaker 4:  I think that, you know, the pixel is contrasty and moody. It always has been

594
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,280
Speaker 4:  apple is what what'd you say? Alex? It's like festival of lights. Like it's

595
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,120
Speaker 4:  very Thomas Kincaid. Like it's, everything is very bright.

596
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,520
Speaker 4:  There's almost no shadow. Like, can you switch it? Can you switch it to rich

597
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,520
Speaker 4:  contrast mode or like mess with a yes, you can do all these things. But it

598
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,200
Speaker 4:  just, I think apple has gotten, they've like backed themselves

599
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,160
Speaker 4:  into a corner with the processing a little bit. And they,

600
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,080
Speaker 4:  this is, I think now with a new sensor, they can collect more light. They

601
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,840
Speaker 4:  can get out of it and go to a different look that does not require them to

602
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,000
Speaker 4:  do the amount of noise. Cause when you shoot 48 megapixel raw,

603
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,440
Speaker 5:  I was just about to ask.

604
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,080
Speaker 4:  It's not like the world's noisiest photo. Like it's a fine photo. They're

605
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,880
Speaker 4:  huge. It takes the shutter. Like when you push the shutter, the capture time

606
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,520
Speaker 4:  is really long.

607
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,640
Speaker 6:  Oh, interesting.

608
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,480
Speaker 4:  Like I would not run around shooting a 48 pro 48 mega per hour. Like

609
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,840
Speaker 4:  you'll just get annoyed and the files are 80 Meg. I can't even destroy this

610
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,720
Speaker 4:  phone in one afternoon, but you can see there's a lot for apple to work

611
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,600
Speaker 4:  with there, but I just, I think they're a year away from that thing. And

612
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,440
Speaker 4:  then God only knows like, they've, you know, they've rebranded this

613
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,680
Speaker 4:  whole thing as the photonic engine. And they've really the main move there

614
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,040
Speaker 4:  is, they've moved deep fusion, the mid light and low light

615
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,960
Speaker 4:  pixel by pixel. Now they're running it early in the process on uncompressed

616
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,880
Speaker 4:  data. And it's still just like, what does sweater mode do?

617
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,520
Speaker 4:  Like, did this do anything like, who knows? But like, you

618
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,640
Speaker 4:  know, they're, they're getting more comfortable sort of talking about their

619
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,480
Speaker 4:  processing pipeline as something other than magic, you know?

620
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,200
Speaker 4:  And like, I think that's good. And I just, I think they can start making

621
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,480
Speaker 4:  different decisions. So that's what, it's a year away from being like, oh,

622
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,320
Speaker 4:  there's a 48 megapixel sensor in this camera. They can do stuff

623
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,720
Speaker 4:  that the 13 pro definitely cannot do. And right now they're just like, we're

624
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,360
Speaker 4:  right on top of each other.

625
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,280
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So is that, is the next turn there then to basically open up

626
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,760
Speaker 5:  like a new set of camera modes to people because it feels like what you're

627
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,400
Speaker 5:  describing is like apple has this like incredible amount of raw power now.

628
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,160
Speaker 5:  And the solution is to give that back to users, like to just

629
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,120
Speaker 5:  let you do more stuff with your camera feels like the next

630
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:53,080
Speaker 5:  turn from like, we just collect an incredible amount of light and have an

631
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,440
Speaker 5:  incredible amount of processing power, like find clever ways to put that

632
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,200
Speaker 5:  back into the camera app seems like where this goes. And I feel like,

633
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,080
Speaker 5:  I just think about like the, what's the thing called in Mac OS now where

634
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,720
Speaker 5:  you can use your phone as the webcam. And it'll also look at your desk,

635
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,960
Speaker 4:  Continuity camera

636
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,600
Speaker 5:  Continuity camera. Thank you. Continuity camera feels like a version of that

637
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,840
Speaker 5:  thing. Right. Where they're just like, okay, now we have lots of pixels to

638
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,640
Speaker 5:  use and lots of processing power with which to use them. Like what wacky

639
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,080
Speaker 5:  new stuff can we open up? And it feels like that's what I would hope apple

640
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,880
Speaker 5:  would spend the next year working on.

641
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,040
Speaker 6:  Are they gonna focus on the camera though? Cause I feel like the camera for

642
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,840
Speaker 6:  the longest time has been the differentiator year to year for, for most phones.

643
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,320
Speaker 6:  Right? Like most phones, the big upgrades camera related,

644
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,440
Speaker 6:  but it also feels like the majority of people have gotten bored with that.

645
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,240
Speaker 6:  Don't care as much about the camera upgrades, like present company

646
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,800
Speaker 6:  excluded.

647
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The 12 pro camera was fine. Yeah. The 13 pro camera was great.

648
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,200
Speaker 4:  Like what are you gonna do?

649
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,000
Speaker 5:  But like action mode, I think is an example of something that is like a,

650
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,600
Speaker 5:  and I've said this on their show before, like is a meaningful change. It

651
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,480
Speaker 5:  doesn't sound like it's great yet. But like that kind of thing is the kind

652
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,680
Speaker 5:  of stuff where it's like, everybody's just running around, making tos all

653
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,640
Speaker 5:  day right now. If you can make them more stable, like you, you have accomplished

654
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,680
Speaker 5:  something real for people.

655
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. So action mode is like really interesting, you know, cuz you

656
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,560
Speaker 4:  know, what they're doing is across all the sensors, they're just like cropping

657
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,880
Speaker 4:  down, you know? There's like the TikTok filter, which just like holds under

658
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,680
Speaker 4:  your face. That is what it is doing. Yeah. Like it just, it just,

659
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,800
Speaker 4:  but without the little line it's cropping the sensor down and then as you

660
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,640
Speaker 4:  move around, it's just moving around the sensor. Yeah. Which is a,

661
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,120
Speaker 4:  you know, that's neat. But as far as I know, when you do it on the

662
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,640
Speaker 4:  48 megapixel sensor on the main wide, it doesn't use the

663
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,520
Speaker 4:  additional space. So you, you don't get like more stabilization

664
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,320
Speaker 4:  off the 48 megale sensor than you do off the other 12 megapixel sensors.

665
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,880
Speaker 4:  Like that's just like one of those like things you could just figure out

666
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,720
Speaker 4:  how to do, you know, like the a 16 bionic processor is like

667
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,600
Speaker 4:  a, is what I, from what I'm told by apple, the performance is off

668
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,520
Speaker 4:  the unlabeled charts.

669
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,240
Speaker 8:  So,

670
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,800
Speaker 6:  So we all just need to be 50 times better. Really excited about

671
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,160
Speaker 6:  iOS 17.

672
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I don't think the camera is the thing they don't update. You're right.

673
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's like, and that's weird. I just think that's weird. I think they

674
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,920
Speaker 4:  should start doing camera updates and versions of iOS. Like you have the

675
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,400
Speaker 4:  hardware particularly like the iPhone 13 pro to the iPhone 14,

676
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,760
Speaker 4:  same processor, same camera. As far as

677
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,480
Speaker 4:  we can tell. Right. 12 lens are same lens. Why does the 14 have the

678
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,040
Speaker 4:  photonic engine with deep fusion and the 13 pro doesn't get it. That's just

679
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,520
Speaker 4:  weird. It's a software camera. Yeah.

680
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,840
Speaker 6:  Cause you need to pay for

681
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,480
Speaker 4:  It. Like I don't, that's like at some point when apple does this

682
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,680
Speaker 4:  segmentation and they're, they're, they're just playing games that I think

683
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,560
Speaker 4:  are, are dumb for software to play. Yeah. But I dunno, we'll see like

684
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,920
Speaker 4:  that, but I'd put the camera like action mode is great. If you have a ton

685
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,600
Speaker 4:  of light and it's still not that great, but like it's a baby step forward

686
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,880
Speaker 4:  to a really important thing. And so like a year from now, will it be like

687
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Speaker 4:  a meaningful change? Like maybe? And that's like, that's I put the camera

688
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,800
Speaker 4:  and the island in that like one year from now, I

689
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,720
Speaker 4:  would put always on display in one year from now, because I think a

690
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,120
Speaker 4:  lot of people are gonna discover that they want their always on display to

691
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,680
Speaker 4:  be slightly more off than this display.

692
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,840
Speaker 5:  Take us through that. Cuz that was the thing. I am like the single feature

693
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,560
Speaker 5:  about the 14 pro I'm most excited about is the always on display. And I left

694
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,920
Speaker 5:  your review. Not kind of thinking like maybe I'm gonna buy this phone and

695
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,400
Speaker 5:  then turn in the, always out display off.

696
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,320
Speaker 4:  I'm definitely turning always on display off.

697
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,360
Speaker 5:  Why is it not good?

698
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,560
Speaker 4:  Bluntly, apples behind Android phones have had this for a, a long time.

699
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,320
Speaker 4:  Yep. And they've had to compete on making that thing. Good. Right. So like

700
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,280
Speaker 4:  across the Android landscape, always on displays, like you can customize

701
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,960
Speaker 4:  them, you can put widgets on them. You can, you can make, 'em look like just

702
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,760
Speaker 4:  a clock you can make 'em look like all kinds of things. They look wildly

703
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,680
Speaker 4:  different than the home screen. Apple's like, what if we just dim the lock

704
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,040
Speaker 4:  screen? Yeah. This is what is occurring. And they don't, you know, and it's

705
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,080
Speaker 4:  still very colorful. So like Becca and I were sitting extra show. We both

706
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,320
Speaker 4:  thought our phones were on all the time.

707
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,520
Speaker 5:  So we say it functionally, not that different from just having your phone

708
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,560
Speaker 5:  on, but the brightness turned like all, almost all the way down. Is that

709
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Speaker 5:  like basically what it feels

710
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,960
Speaker 4:  Like? Well, and the screen is only refreshing it. One hurts. Like imagine

711
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,880
Speaker 4:  you had a way shittier version of your

712
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,080
Speaker 8:  Phone.

713
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So it's like, you know the screen isn't updating, but notifications

714
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,400
Speaker 4:  are flying. Yeah. Like it looks too on. Yeah. And like, I would

715
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,320
Speaker 4:  prefer like that pixel style, fade it or Samsung style, fade it all the

716
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,760
Speaker 4:  way to black and white, you know, and like show o'clock show o'clock in like

717
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,400
Speaker 4:  my next calendar appointment. Yep. Call it a day. Right. And the other,

718
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,120
Speaker 4:  I noticed this in, I think mark noticed this too. It feels like

719
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,600
Speaker 4:  it's running the battery down faster. Yeah.

720
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,480
Speaker 5:  Which is like the main thing apple says it doesn't

721
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,520
Speaker 4:  Do. It's just like, it's the wrong set of trades.

722
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,400
Speaker 6:  Like I think we don't want to, to happen. Yeah. It

723
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,080
Speaker 6:  has to because you're still you're, you're still firing those pixels. Like

724
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Speaker 6:  everybody else did it, black and white because you could turn all the black

725
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,600
Speaker 6:  as just the pixels are. Yeah. You could

726
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,400
Speaker 4:  Turn almost to

727
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,760
Speaker 6:  The screen and they're like, what if we left the entire screen

728
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,680
Speaker 6:  on? Yeah. But at 20% brightness, right.

729
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,160
Speaker 4:  A better way of thinking about the always on display at most Android phones

730
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,880
Speaker 4:  is that it is the mostly off display. Yeah. And

731
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,240
Speaker 4:  Apple's like, yo, this thing's on. Yeah.

732
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:06,880
Speaker 6:  It's

733
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,760
Speaker 4:  Just on. So, and I think, you know, like, as we've seen from I 16 tons

734
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,520
Speaker 4:  and tons of customization is in I yeah. So it's like just like

735
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,080
Speaker 4:  another year of refinement away from being great. Yeah. These are all the

736
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,520
Speaker 4:  reasons it got an eight. Like we reset our scores cuz we had score inflation,

737
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,840
Speaker 4:  but I'm just like, well always UN display, like not a thing like cameras

738
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,440
Speaker 4:  like pretty much the same. Like I wouldn't say it's necessarily

739
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,360
Speaker 4:  better than the, the pixel or S 22 ultra in fact, in some ways

740
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,720
Speaker 4:  it's definitely worse in some ways it's much better, but yeah. It's like,

741
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,560
Speaker 4:  it's a tie to just behind like that's how I put the camera on video. I think

742
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,640
Speaker 4:  it's way ahead of everybody as always. And then the island is like, who knows?

743
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,400
Speaker 6:  It's crisp

744
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,840
Speaker 4:  Question mark city. Yeah. It's very crisp. And the rest of the stuff is like

745
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Speaker 4:  satellite connectivity. It's like, it's not even out yet. And I can't review

746
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,760
Speaker 4:  it. I can just tell you it's there car crash detection. Like I don't know.

747
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,680
Speaker 6:  Did you, you didn't crash a car.

748
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,360
Speaker 4:  We did not crash a car. I have heard tell that there are some plans

749
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,440
Speaker 4:  to crash some cars.

750
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,200
Speaker 6:  I have also probably heard that.

751
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,160
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We're gonna Alex. After the show, we have to figure out our insurance

752
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,400
Speaker 4:  force for the car crashing.

753
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,880
Speaker 6:  It's gonna be great guys. Stay tuned.

754
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,960
Speaker 5:  This feels like the sort of thing I'm gonna be made to do against my will.

755
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,840
Speaker 5:  And I just want everyone to know that I don't want do it. I'm saying it on

756
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:16,960
Speaker 5:  this

757
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,920

771
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,550
Speaker 9:  When was the last time you were alone? When you truly didn't know

772
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:59,390
Speaker 9:  where to turn, was it your first day at a new school or having to take

773
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,310
Speaker 9:  the bus alone or maybe it was your first time in a new city point? Is

774
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,990
Speaker 9:  that the feeling of being alone? Just doesn't always sit well with us. You

775
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,350
Speaker 9:  need to find your own crew. Those who like the things that you do and with

776
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,350
Speaker 9:  LinkedIn, not only can you find that crew, they can help your professional

777
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,030

808
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,400
Speaker 10:  us

809
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,430
Speaker 4:  We're back. I think we can dispense with the apple watch series eight very

810
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:20,670
Speaker 4:  quickly.

811
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,870
Speaker 5:  I think that's right. Unfortunately that seems to be

812
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,430
Speaker 6:  Right. It also does car crashes.

813
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,390
Speaker 4:  It does that's car crash

814
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,070
Speaker 6:  Put on your fluffy gloves.

815
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,430
Speaker 4:  So car crash plans in the future aside the

816
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:36,230
Speaker 4:  video team tried to trigger crash detection with the series

817
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,750
Speaker 4:  eight, by buying an RC truck, mounting a GoPro to it,

818
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,550
Speaker 4:  and then having the watch on the truck just like crash into stuff. And

819
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,790
Speaker 4:  that's, I mean, why do we, why did we, why did we start the verge?

820
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,550
Speaker 6:  I, I, I learned about that because I just heard the wine of the

821
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,470
Speaker 6:  motor through the office and I was like, what is that noise?

822
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:58,430
Speaker 6:  And then I saw it whip around the corner and just crash sadly into a

823
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:58,630
Speaker 6:  desk.

824
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,270
Speaker 4:  Yesterday was one of the busiest days in our office. In the past two years,

825
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,550
Speaker 4:  there was like apparently some sales conference. And obviously we had the

826
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,190
Speaker 4:  relaunch and there's a bunch of product people. And it's like, how does the

827
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,030
Speaker 4:  verge team show up? Well, we've attached a watch to an RC truck and we're

828
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,830
Speaker 4:  just crashing it into walls. This is what we do here.

829
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,550
Speaker 4:  Welcome

830
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,950
Speaker 6:  We're professional adults.

831
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,870
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's great. It did not work. We did not generate sufficient G forces

832
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,590
Speaker 4:  to trigger or the watch was like silly

833
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,710
Speaker 4:  children. Yeah, this won't do it. The

834
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,950
Speaker 5:  Only answer is to get slightly bigger vehicles until

835
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,560
Speaker 5:  it actually triggers.

836
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,720
Speaker 4:  I think it might also know that it wasn't on a person. So I think we have

837
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,600
Speaker 4:  to get like a Luke warm sausage and like, you know,

838
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,760
Speaker 4:  just be like trying to trick it in the face tense detection.

839
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,160
Speaker 5:  No, we have to put, we have to put David in a power wheels and then see what

840
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,640
Speaker 5:  happens. I'll do it.

841
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,960
Speaker 4:  I think you're just getting in the car with the fluffy helmet dog. That's

842
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,760
Speaker 6:  What you're doing. It's in the mail. Get ready.

843
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,640
Speaker 4:  So the, the series eight, largely the same as the series seven and I think

844
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,080
Speaker 4:  V's point was if you have like a series three, you should upgrade and you'll

845
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,760
Speaker 4:  have the time of your life and everyone else will be fine because the new

846
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,600
Speaker 4:  watch OS will bring you almost all of these features.

847
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,280
Speaker 6:  Right?

848
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:12,000
Speaker 5:  It's kind of the same story as the iPhone 14, right? It's like if yours

849
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,520
Speaker 5:  is, if like you're you use the one you have, and it is

850
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,240
Speaker 5:  obviously nearing the end of its life, upgrade to this one, you'll be psyched.

851
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,160
Speaker 5:  If you already have one that you like quite a bit, don't worry about it.

852
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,080
Speaker 5:  Nothing is going to change. The ultra seems to be a very different story,

853
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,760
Speaker 5:  but we haven't reviewed that yet. So we'll see. But the, yeah, the series

854
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,960
Speaker 5:  eight is like, for me, it's like I haven't had a watch in a few years. I

855
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,960
Speaker 5:  was like all in on the watch for a little while and then kind of like tapped

856
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,840
Speaker 5:  out on having too many notifications on my wrist. So I just like stopped

857
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,240
Speaker 5:  being an apple watch guy for a few years. And I think I'm gonna get back

858
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,200
Speaker 5:  in. And now the question is like, if I had bought a series

859
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,960
Speaker 5:  seven, I would not feel the need to upgrade. Now I can't buy a series seven,

860
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,720
Speaker 5:  so I'm gonna buy a series eight because it's just the one to buy. Yeah. But

861
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,400
Speaker 5:  there doesn't seem to be anything. If you've bought a watch in the last

862
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,920
Speaker 5:  say three years, it's very unlikely that anything here is gonna blow your

863
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,680
Speaker 5:  mind. It's we it's wild to me that apple got to this point of these like

864
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,720
Speaker 5:  teeny tiny annual upgrades this quickly with the watch. But

865
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,960
Speaker 5:  this just seems to be kind of where we are. I mean,

866
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,400
Speaker 6:  They could fix the battery life. Like there's stuff they could actually be

867
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,680
Speaker 6:  doing that they're not, or that they haven't,

868
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,280
Speaker 5:  I'm not sure that's even true though. Like it's a small thing.

869
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,400
Speaker 4:  They did fix the battery life with the ultra. They made it gigantic. And

870
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:19,520
Speaker 5:  My shadow

871
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:20,040
Speaker 4:  In there,

872
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,720
Speaker 6:  They shove a couple more batteries

873
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,520
Speaker 4:  In there. They solved your problem. Yeah. I think it, you know, it's interesting

874
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,920
Speaker 4:  cuz the reason we're saying the iPhone 14 is that the sitter of stage is

875
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,840
Speaker 4:  like they're out of iPhone customers. And so now they just have to

876
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,080
Speaker 4:  be there and then squeeze you for apple TV money. It's like as hard

877
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,880
Speaker 4:  as they can, the watch is not there. Right?

878
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,720
Speaker 4:  The, the total market for apple watches is the installed base of the

879
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,680
Speaker 4:  iPhone. And as far as I know, they have not yet arrived at one to one

880
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,560
Speaker 4:  apple watch to iPhone

881
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,080
Speaker 5:  Sales. If they are apple is lying on it. Earnings. Yeah.

882
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,800
Speaker 6:  Well, I mean that's, that's part of why they did the, the thermometers right.

883
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,720
Speaker 6:  Temperature readers. What are those called

884
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,920
Speaker 5:  Temperature sensors

885
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,800
Speaker 6:  There? We go

886
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,520
Speaker 4:  Your belief is that the, the thermometer, the,

887
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,480
Speaker 4:  that there are people around the world with iPhones being like, if

888
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,800
Speaker 4:  only I knew what temperature was.

889
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,240
Speaker 6:  No, cuz I think this is part of, there's been this weird kind

890
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:12,800
Speaker 6:  divide.

891
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,240
Speaker 4:  Oh, I see what you mean

892
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:18,040
Speaker 6:  In right. There's been this gender divide in wearables. Oftentimes people

893
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,760
Speaker 6:  who identify as women have been put pointed towards like get the aura ring,

894
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,440
Speaker 6:  get a Fitbit. Like you don't need a whole lot. Oh you're you identify as

895
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,160
Speaker 6:  a man, you need the biggest smartest watch you can buy. And,

896
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,280
Speaker 6:  and this like apple kind of perpetuated that by being like, look at this

897
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,040
Speaker 6:  manly, manly, enormous ultra, and then look at this

898
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,840
Speaker 6:  smaller one that can track your period or help you anticipate

899
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,560
Speaker 6:  your ovulation through temperature readings.

900
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,320
Speaker 4:  No, you can. It cannot help you do that.

901
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,280
Speaker 6:  It can't, it can help you. It

902
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,000
Speaker 5:  Can tell you after the fact

903
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,760
Speaker 6:  It'll tell you afterwards, and then you can use that to be like, Hmm,

904
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,880
Speaker 6:  maybe I'll have a better idea for next time.

905
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,640
Speaker 4:  Right. And then apple is not on the hook for their off

906
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,600
Speaker 4:  book, unlicensed, FDA. Right? That's

907
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,280
Speaker 4:  just you guessing

908
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,640
Speaker 6:  That's you guessing, right? You just wanna, you wanna get that sensor and

909
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,160
Speaker 6:  go for that. But it's, it's very like fundamentally appealing to these women

910
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,520
Speaker 6:  and saying, Hey, if you don't wanna go get one of these other devices out

911
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,480
Speaker 6:  there, if you wanna be part of the apple ecosystem, we've got you

912
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,280
Speaker 6:  now. And I don't know if that's gonna be successful, especially because like

913
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,440
Speaker 6:  they really half-assed it by being like, we will not get any sort of approval

914
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,280
Speaker 6:  whatsoever. We're just gonna put this out here so you can anticipate and

915
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,000
Speaker 6:  use it on your own time. And that's like not great, but

916
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,360
Speaker 6:  yeah.

917
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:34,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But I, you know, I think these review had it, right. There's a couple

918
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,760
Speaker 4:  apps that on different platforms are that do have the

919
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,040
Speaker 4:  certification to do it

920
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,640
Speaker 6:  And you can use those.

921
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,560
Speaker 4:  You can see how apple would, you can see how they would show up on the watch

922
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,800
Speaker 4:  and maybe get the certification. You can see how apple would go after the

923
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,560
Speaker 4:  certification. Yeah. So yeah. I, I, I buy that like, okay, they're

924
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,200
Speaker 4:  expanding the capabilities of this thing such that they might be able to

925
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,880
Speaker 4:  get more people.

926
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,560
Speaker 6:  Right? Yeah. And I think that's exactly what it is. It's just like, we know

927
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,600
Speaker 6:  there's this huge market of people who historically, haven't been buying

928
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,960
Speaker 6:  these as often they've been on these other platforms and

929
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,880
Speaker 6:  now we can convince them to get this really big watch that continues to be

930
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,000
Speaker 6:  grow larger every year. Not every year, every other year. Yeah.

931
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,920
Speaker 6:  I'm upset about it.

932
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,320
Speaker 5:  I have a theory about this that I'm just developing right this second. And

933
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,040
Speaker 5:  I'm curious what you guys think. It seems like one of the things that apple

934
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:25,280
Speaker 5:  pulled off with the iPhone was to basically open up the app

935
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,480
Speaker 5:  store and make everybody else make the case for the iPhone for them. Right?

936
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,400
Speaker 5:  Like the, the, the apple designed very few of the best things about the

937
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,160
Speaker 5:  iPhone, ultimately that is not true on the apple watch in like

938
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,120
Speaker 5:  any meaningful way apple designs, all of the things about the apple watch

939
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,400
Speaker 5:  at this point. And the, the, like, there are apps on it obviously, but I

940
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,200
Speaker 5:  I've seen very few apple watch apps that appear to be like apple watch first

941
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,760
Speaker 5:  apps there there're like companions to other things or sort of

942
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,920
Speaker 5:  barely thought of things. And I,

943
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah, but there's one now there's exactly one flow.

944
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,640
Speaker 4:  No, it's oceanic. Plus by, by Huish on the apple watch

945
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,480
Speaker 4:  ultra fair. This is the one they built the entire watch.

946
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,160
Speaker 4:  They partnered with another company, which is a big move for apple.

947
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And that app is supposed to sell the apple

948
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,000
Speaker 4:  watch ultra to scuba divers. And I don't think that it is meant to be used

949
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,800
Speaker 4:  as an extension of an iPhone app, because if you're using your

950
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,560
Speaker 4:  iPhone in the open ocean, you have problems. So like they've got

951
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,920
Speaker 4:  one. Yeah. And maybe that's the beginning of something else. But I think,

952
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,960
Speaker 4:  think that's just mostly related to how often do

953
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,640
Speaker 4:  you have your apple watch without your phone? And they still sell lots of

954
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,360
Speaker 4:  I'm. I would bet most of apple watches that get sold don't even have the

955
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,440
Speaker 4:  cellular capability. And even the ones I'd send the last year and a half

956
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,880
Speaker 4:  with an cellular capable apple watch that I never hooked up. Yeah. Cause

957
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:48,320
Speaker 4:  it's been a pandemic. I was like, what am I gonna do? Make a call from this

958
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,960
Speaker 4:  downstairs. I'll just go upstairs and get my phone.

959
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,800
Speaker 6:  Is there ever a case where like, cuz I never feel comfortable going

960
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,960
Speaker 6:  with just my watch and not my phone. Right. Like if I get a phone call, then

961
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,880
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna have to figure out the AirPod situation. I can't play music on

962
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,400
Speaker 6:  it as well. Like I don't trust the apple

963
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,560
Speaker 6:  pay and stuff on it. I should. But I don't like,

964
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you should definitely trust that. That's fine. But

965
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,680
Speaker 6:  There, there, I think there I'm not the only one. I think there is a lot

966
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,600
Speaker 6:  of people who, who do have this like slight phobia of just going with the

967
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,360
Speaker 6:  watch and leaving the phone at home. Like

968
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,400
Speaker 4:  You should do it. When I, when we lived in the city and I would go on walks

969
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,920
Speaker 4:  with max, I would only take the watch. And it was great cuz I didn't have

970
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,760
Speaker 4:  my phone. And so like I could get texts. I could make the one phone. Like

971
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,400
Speaker 4:  I could make the emergency phone call if I needed it. Yeah. I could pay for

972
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,360
Speaker 4:  stuff. I still have my wallet, but it was great. Cuz I couldn't like check

973
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,840
Speaker 4:  Twitter and see what people were mad about.

974
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:37,800
Speaker 6:  But besides those walks, how often are you without

975
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,480
Speaker 6:  your phone?

976
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:43,080
Speaker 4:  Well, now I live in a house that's full of computers. Yeah. It's a real problem.

977
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:47,400
Speaker 4:  I gotta buy another house. It's no computers shack in the woods.

978
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,000
Speaker 4:  Okay. I'm just saying like give it a shot. Like yeah. But I,

979
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:54,000
Speaker 4:  that, like we said, we were gonna dispense with the series a quickly, like

980
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,640
Speaker 4:  now we are just generically talking about the apple watch.

981
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,320
Speaker 5:  Yes.

982
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,240
Speaker 4:  Right. The series eight is an instantiation of the apple watch is very

983
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,080
Speaker 4:  iterative. Very nice. And they've added capabilities that might appeal to

984
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,440
Speaker 4:  a few more people, maybe many more people

985
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,440
Speaker 6:  And focus modes too in

986
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,000
Speaker 4:  Focus. But

987
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:13,000
Speaker 6:  No, that one's cool because I'm gonna be able to have like when I'm not at

988
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,840
Speaker 6:  work, have one that doesn't have my calendar on it. That's good. Not having

989
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,680
Speaker 6:  to look at my calendar while I'm off work. That sounds great.

990
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:22,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We'll talk about the ultra more next week. I think that's the

991
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,480
Speaker 4:  interesting one. So very nice. If you have a three upgrade you, anything

992
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,360
Speaker 4:  else? You know, upgrade, watch west. You're gonna be very happy. David. You

993
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,160
Speaker 4:  wanna talk about iOS 16 real quick? Sure.

994
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,400
Speaker 5:  I mean you've used it actually in a funny way, in a more advanced

995
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,400
Speaker 5:  way than I have. Like one of the funny things, I mean it comes back to what

996
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,520
Speaker 5:  we were talking about before, right? Like one of the most interesting things

997
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:44,480
Speaker 5:  about iOS 16 is gonna be live activities in the, and the dynamic island

998
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,120
Speaker 5:  cuz the whole like thesis of iOS 16. If I was to like

999
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,160
Speaker 5:  have a big heady thought about iOS 16 is that it is trying to make

1000
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,360
Speaker 5:  your phone do more things without you having to do them. And we've talked

1001
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,720
Speaker 5:  about this already on the show, but it's like the always on screen is about

1002
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,800
Speaker 5:  this. Like how do you get information without having to open up your phone?

1003
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,280
Speaker 5:  Which I think is like an absolutely correct path for apple to be on based

1004
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,160
Speaker 5:  on your review. It doesn't sound like it's handling it perfectly, but like

1005
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:12,200
Speaker 5:  lock screen widgets are amazing. Like huge win.

1006
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,880
Speaker 5:  I wish I could have more of them. I wish they were more interactive, but

1007
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,080
Speaker 5:  like I can tap on my phone and I can see what is next on my calendar. And

1008
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,760
Speaker 5:  I can press one button to take a note on my phone.

1009
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,640
Speaker 6:  You went widgets instead of the cutout.

1010
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,280
Speaker 5:  Yeah. None of my pictures are cool enough to need a cut out. Although I do

1011
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,800
Speaker 5:  now my, my calendar widget is over top of my wife's face and

1012
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,640
Speaker 5:  she is not thrilled with that. I would

1013
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:32,760
Speaker 4:  Say

1014
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,760
Speaker 5:  There was some consternation, but I think it's great. And like using, having

1015
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,120
Speaker 5:  a bunch of different lock screens that like I was talking about or hooked

1016
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,560
Speaker 5:  to focus modes is great. There's like these little ideas, especially about

1017
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,080
Speaker 5:  the lock screen that I think apple got like really right. And then everything

1018
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,040
Speaker 5:  else about iOS 16 is just like common sense stuff that it would've been

1019
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,320
Speaker 5:  great to have had several years ago, but it's here now and pretty happy about

1020
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,040
Speaker 5:  it. And that's like, that's basically been the story of iOS for a while is

1021
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,200
Speaker 5:  they're just like, oh here's a future you want, we made it for you.

1022
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:01,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's interesting. Cuz all the stuff you're describing that you want

1023
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,840
Speaker 4:  on the lock screen is stuff that I have in my apple watch.

1024
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,360
Speaker 5:  That's interesting.

1025
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,080
Speaker 4:  Right. Like I never do any of this customization cuz like what I put, I just,

1026
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,520
Speaker 4:  I use the modular face in the watch, right? Yeah. So like all there's the

1027
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,200
Speaker 4:  calendar. I just look at it. Like there's not much else. I guess

1028
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,000
Speaker 4:  it's that's a weird dynamic. Yeah. Right? Like you can overload your lock

1029
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,720
Speaker 4:  screen with ambient information or you can just like overload your wa

1030
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,720
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah. No I think that's right.

1031
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,680
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I did the cutout cuz I don't need the widgets. Like those are all on

1032
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,520
Speaker 6:  my watch. Yeah. But I do, I do have one quibble with iOS 16.

1033
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,280
Speaker 6:  I was talking with will Joel, our creative director. And we were mainly talking

1034
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,000
Speaker 6:  about the verge website and I was grilling him on the colors and

1035
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,320
Speaker 6:  everything cuz I wanted to understand it cuz I just think it's neat to talk

1036
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,840
Speaker 6:  about color choices. Is

1037
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,880
Speaker 5:  It the clock fonts? It

1038
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,800
Speaker 6:  Moves the clock fonts. Like we immediately started talking about the clock

1039
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,160
Speaker 6:  fonts. So like I was, I was like, look at these fonts, I'm talking about

1040
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,320
Speaker 6:  the verge site. And I'm like, these fonts are great. Unlike these fonts.

1041
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,160
Speaker 6:  And he had a really, really interesting point that I thought was great

1042
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,040
Speaker 6:  was just that like the, the watch fonts they've given us so much

1043
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,240
Speaker 6:  choice. It's almost anti apple cuz they've given us these really

1044
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:09,320
Speaker 6:  ugly watch fonts. Right? Like they're all kind of

1045
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,080
Speaker 6:  unattractive and they didn't think what they, it didn't have that like

1046
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,880
Speaker 6:  apple touch cuz apple usually is so good at design.

1047
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,960
Speaker 6:  And if it's gonna give you choices, it's always gonna give you choices that

1048
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,840
Speaker 6:  it thinks are aesthetically pleasing. And I refuse to believe that it thinks

1049
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,600
Speaker 6:  these fonts are aesthetically pleasing, especially because they don't like

1050
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,440
Speaker 6:  thes fonts. You can choose don't work with the widget sands

1051
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,240
Speaker 6:  fonts. Yes. They, they clash and you're like, this is ugly. Yep.

1052
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,880
Speaker 6:  And so an apple and it was just really,

1053
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:39,400
Speaker 6:  I

1054
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,640
Speaker 4:  Hate it, but that's what they want. It's my space time for gen Z. And it's

1055
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,400
Speaker 4:  gonna happen on their lock screens. Ugh.

1056
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:48,280
Speaker 5:  That's real. I mean the fact that that widget Smith app is so

1057
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,520
Speaker 5:  massively popular is like, there are definitely people at

1058
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,680
Speaker 5:  apple park who took notice of that, that like people wanna make

1059
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,800
Speaker 5:  their phones uglier in this service of making it look more like

1060
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,000
Speaker 5:  them. And that's actually the correct thing for apple to do. I also Alex,

1061
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,680
Speaker 5:  to your point, I think it's not apple. I think what you just described is

1062
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,400
Speaker 5:  Johnny. I like like the, the thing where

1063
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,920
Speaker 5:  it's just like, this is the right answer. And if you don't like it, you're

1064
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,520
Speaker 5:  wrong and can just go screw yourself. Yeah. That's Johnny.

1065
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,440
Speaker 5:  That was all Johnny I've. And I think like when he's gone you can draw a

1066
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,360
Speaker 5:  pretty straight line to this.

1067
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:25,320
Speaker 6:  He was like, he was that apple design. And I think if, if, if this was, if

1068
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,600
Speaker 6:  that was Johnny and this is like obviously an operating system made without

1069
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,480
Speaker 6:  his influence for the most part, as far as we know. Mm. Less than less

1070
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,920
Speaker 6:  than previous years at the very

1071
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,760
Speaker 5:  Least less influence. Certainly. Yeah.

1072
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,320
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Then what does that mean for apple in its its own

1073
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,640
Speaker 6:  philosophy about design? Because that's a pretty radical shift to say, like

1074
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,560
Speaker 6:  to go from being like, we, we know it looks good and we'll guide you

1075
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:50,200
Speaker 6:  to here's some fonts, here's some colors you do. You,

1076
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:54,440
Speaker 4:  It's not, it's some, that's what, it's some fonts and some

1077
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,680
Speaker 4:  colors. If apple was like any font and

1078
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,080
Speaker 6:  It's

1079
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,840
Speaker 4:  What I want iOS users for like comic sand let's do

1080
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:01,880
Speaker 6:  Wing.

1081
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,320
Speaker 4:  They're not doing that. They they've, pre-selected some

1082
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,080
Speaker 4:  aesthetics for you,

1083
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,480
Speaker 6:  But they're bad aesthetics. And

1084
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,680
Speaker 4:  You may engage in them,

1085
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,320
Speaker 6:  But they're like,

1086
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,000
Speaker 5:  But like some of them are very ugly. I agree. But I think like the, even

1087
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,200
Speaker 5:  when you go to pick a lock screen, it actually does this in a very interesting

1088
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,480
Speaker 5:  way. Cuz it gives you, it basically like stack ranks, what it thinks are

1089
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,120
Speaker 5:  good ideas. And it'll even pick a bunch of your photos that it's like, what

1090
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,440
Speaker 5:  if you use this photo as your lock screen, that might look nice. But then

1091
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,080
Speaker 5:  if you like,

1092
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:29,960
Speaker 6:  It picked a photo of my friend, Sam at his wedding,

1093
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,840
Speaker 6:  crushed it. And it was like, don't you want a picture of your friend, Sam

1094
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,760
Speaker 6:  at his wedding to look at every day for the rest of your life. When you turn

1095
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,680
Speaker 6:  on your phone. And I was like, no, apple, what?

1096
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,800
Speaker 5:  What's wrong with your friend, Sam? What do you have against Sam?

1097
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,880
Speaker 6:  Like, I mean, he's fine, but we're not friends enough for him to be on

1098
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,880
Speaker 6:  my phone like that.

1099
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,040
Speaker 5:  All my lock screens are are of you guys. I don't know what you're talking

1100
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:49,320
Speaker 5:  about.

1101
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,360
Speaker 4:  There's already a TikTok meme of like people changing lock screen for their

1102
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,920
Speaker 4:  side, their side pieces. It's pretty good. It's

1103
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,240
Speaker 6:  Like pretty good focus modes.

1104
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:01,200
Speaker 4:  That's

1105
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,560
Speaker 5:  A good use of focus mode. That

1106
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,200
Speaker 6:  Is my cheat and focus mode as you did, it's all you

1107
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,640
Speaker 4:  All right. We should take another break. I can't wait for these live activities.

1108
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,840
Speaker 4:  It's the point of I 16 is like live activities. Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna be

1109
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,640
Speaker 4:  cool. It's gonna be great. Like it's a big deal and it's just like not here

1110
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,960
Speaker 4:  yet. All right. We gotta take another break. We'll go through a little lightning

1127
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,750
Speaker 4:  Okay, we're back. Do we want to talk about the pixel book?

1128
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,670
Speaker 5:  I do, but before we do, can I give one more iOS 16 thing? Yes.

1129
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:41,750
Speaker 5:  I got the greatest comment that I've ever gotten from a story that I wrote

1130
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,710
Speaker 5:  on the verge.com and it, it has emboldened me to share the thing that I

1131
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:49,710
Speaker 5:  discovered on this podcast. So I wrote in the I 16 interview

1132
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,790
Speaker 5:  that it was stupid that you couldn't sort in messages just to see

1133
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,750
Speaker 5:  your unread messages because that's stupid and you've never been

1134
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,830
Speaker 5:  able to do that. And that's stupid that that can't happen. You can unsend

1135
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,510
Speaker 5:  messages. That's great. You can edit messages. That's great. You couldn't

1136
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:06,550
Speaker 5:  just sort to see the unread ones. And we all have that one message from like

1137
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:08,750
Speaker 5:  two and a half years ago. That's the reason you still have the badge and

1138
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,710
Speaker 5:  your messages app. Anyway, I got a bunch of people on Twitter. Thank you

1139
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,390
Speaker 5:  to all of you who said, actually you can do this. There's a, there's a thing

1140
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:17,830
Speaker 5:  at the top left that says filters. And if you go to filters, you can now

1141
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:21,510
Speaker 5:  filter down to unread messages, but you can

1142
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:25,310
Speaker 5:  only do this. If you've turned on a feature in settings, you go to settings

1143
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:29,110
Speaker 5:  messages, scroll all the way down and turn on filter. Unknown sends. It's

1144
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:32,870
Speaker 5:  not on by default. Oh, but if you turn it on, then you go to the

1145
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,590
Speaker 5:  messages app and you'll have a filters button at the top. And you can filter

1146
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,550
Speaker 5:  just to see your unread messages. What? This is the greatest thing ever.

1147
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:42,750
Speaker 5:  I wrote about it on the verge. And it was like this hidden feature lets you

1148
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:46,150
Speaker 5:  filter. And I just, for everyone listening, I just blew both of their minds

1149
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:47,150
Speaker 5:  right now. This is the greatest thing.

1150
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,230
Speaker 4:  And then there's a red button. Yeah. This

1151
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:49,870
Speaker 6:  Is incredible.

1152
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,270
Speaker 4:  You can select all mark red.

1153
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,790
Speaker 5:  It's magic.

1154
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:54,190
Speaker 4:  Well, I can't do that cuz I need to get back to some people. But,

1155
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,990
Speaker 5:  But I wrote about this and somebody commented saying usually when I read

1156
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:01,510
Speaker 5:  the 10 hidden tricks, it's all stuff I know, but I didn't know this one.

1157
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:05,070
Speaker 5:  So thank you. Aww. And I was like, yes. So turn on filter.

1158
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:08,510
Speaker 5:  Unknown sends filter, unread, life changing. You're welcome.

1159
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:12,070
Speaker 4:  The other thing, the reason that I had filter unknown sends on already is

1160
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:15,990
Speaker 4:  cuz I have an app called robo color, which is amazing. It, it

1161
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,790
Speaker 4:  not only blocks spam calls. Sometimes it just takes them and plays

1162
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:23,710
Speaker 4:  script at them. Yes. And that script that's be bonkers. And then it

1163
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:27,510
Speaker 4:  records that. And then sometimes you can just listen to that interaction.

1164
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:28,630
Speaker 5:  That's a podcast. I would

1165
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:32,310
Speaker 4:  Listen. That's funniest thing that you can do on your phone. It's like

1166
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,230
Speaker 4:  just an old man going hello? Hello for five minutes.

1167
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:40,070
Speaker 4:  And I'm desperate spammer trying to get through that wall.

1168
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:40,630
Speaker 6:  That's

1169
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:41,190
Speaker 5:  I want that's

1170
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:44,230
Speaker 4:  Awesome. It's it's a very good, highly recommended. It's like four bucks

1171
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:48,150
Speaker 4:  a month and every now I just listen to 'em but that's why I filter on and

1172
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:51,630
Speaker 4:  send on. They need to do it with text when people replied to spam texts.

1173
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:51,870
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1174
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:56,030
Speaker 6:  Yes. So now if you delete, I, I found this out cause I got a spam text yesterday.

1175
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:59,790
Speaker 6:  I'm on 16 and I deleted it and I said, do you wanna report this as junk?

1176
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,430
Speaker 6:  Ooh. And I was like, what? Love that game changer.

1177
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,830
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And then I did deleted another text and I didn't wanna report that

1178
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:08,350
Speaker 6:  one as junk. I was like, no, that's just my mom.

1179
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,070
Speaker 5:  That's just my friend, Sam. Who's

1180
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,350
Speaker 4:  Not is why she buy your mom. An iPhone messages. App is industry leading

1181
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:18,350
Speaker 4:  the worst. Okay. Let's start, let's start with the pixel book. So

1182
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:22,400
Speaker 4:  this is, is rewind. Rich minor comes back to

1183
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,040
Speaker 4:  Google to start a tablet division. Oh wow. To make hard work. Okay. All right.

1184
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,800
Speaker 4:  And then they're like, yep. It happened. Yep. We're excited about Android

1185
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,160
Speaker 4:  tablets again. Then there's a recession

1186
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:33,720
Speaker 4:  in quotes.

1187
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:34,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1188
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,520
Speaker 4:  Depending on who you talk to on what day? Right. Ish. And

1189
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,200
Speaker 4:  Google's like clamping down sun doors telling people like tighten up, be

1190
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,920
Speaker 4:  20% more productive. Remember how Google you could like spend 20% of your

1191
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,880
Speaker 4:  time inventing Gmail we're done with that do stuff that we

1192
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,480
Speaker 4:  want you to do instead. So Google's clamping down. They just shut down area

1193
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,200
Speaker 4:  one 20, which is their like inventions factory. We've covered a bunch of

1194
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,680
Speaker 4:  inventions. They're spinning off project balloon tech into some other

1195
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,200
Speaker 4:  that's the internet balloons. Remember when every tech company was like,

1196
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,080
Speaker 4:  what if internet from the sky? Google's like balloons and Facebook was like

1197
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,000
Speaker 4:  planes and they, I don't know. So Google's clamping down and it seems

1198
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,360
Speaker 4:  like one of the things that got clamped was the next pixel book.

1199
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,640
Speaker 4:  Yes. And they're just winding it down.

1200
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:21,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So according to our reporting, they had, they, they knew what this

1201
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:25,240
Speaker 5:  thing was going to be. It had been prototyped. It was scheduled to launch

1202
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,080
Speaker 5:  next year. And not only is that not going to happen, the team that

1203
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,680
Speaker 5:  was building it is no longer.

1204
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:34,320
Speaker 6:  They were all told to find jobs elsewhere in Google. Right.

1205
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:38,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Which is also just a funny thing that you can be like, Hey,

1206
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,520
Speaker 6:  you still work here, but find a job,

1207
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,080
Speaker 4:  Find something to do with don't you. Yeah.

1208
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:48,040
Speaker 5:  Well do be more productive. Yeah. And I think, look, it it's one of those

1209
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,960
Speaker 5:  things that like if, if a hundred million people had bought a pixel book,

1210
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,960
Speaker 5:  they would still be making pixel books. So it's, this is the kind of thing

1211
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,080
Speaker 5:  that there's like a small set of tech nerds who really loved the pixel book.

1212
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:01,000
Speaker 5:  The pixel book was perfect. Laptop hardware. I will, I will go to my

1213
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,880
Speaker 5:  grave believing this a hundred percent perfect. It needed like the second

1214
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,120
Speaker 5:  version of it. Would've had slightly smaller bezels and it would've been

1215
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,440
Speaker 5:  fine, but it was, it was unbelievably great. It's still my favorite laptop

1216
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,360
Speaker 5:  hardware I've ever used.

1217
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:14,120
Speaker 4:  No, the Chromebook pixels, my favorite laptop hardware, the

1218
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,080
Speaker 5:  Chromebook pixel was awesome.

1219
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,400
Speaker 4:  Actually. That's not true. My 16 inch MacBook pro with M one pro is the best

1220
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,760
Speaker 4:  laptop hardware used.

1221
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:20,440
Speaker 5:  That's

1222
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,720
Speaker 6:  Fair's all about that pixel book.

1223
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,880
Speaker 5:  But the Chromebook still came out nine years ago

1224
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,880
Speaker 4:  And like it, yeah. My mom still uses the one that I got her and it is

1225
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,120
Speaker 4:  lovely. Cuz I bought her one with core I seven to run Chrome.

1226
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:35,840
Speaker 4:  It kicks Chrome. It's great. It was overkill at the time,

1227
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:39,600
Speaker 4:  but it's great. It's still, it's still rocking cuz it just runs Chrome. Yeah.

1228
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and I think the, the story really here

1229
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,440
Speaker 5:  as, as Alex and I were working on this story, Alex in the editing,

1230
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:50,360
Speaker 5:  Alex I yeah, sorry. Alex Kranz had nothing to do with it and deserves

1231
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,120
Speaker 6:  Nothing at all. I was like, Ooh, a surprise.

1232
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,120
Speaker 5:  But Dan cer sent this link to a, a

1233
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:00,120
Speaker 5:  study saying basically that like the PC market had this huge run up in

1234
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,240
Speaker 5:  the course of the pandemic and has like crashed back down to earth and Chromos

1235
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,560
Speaker 5:  has crashed even harder back down to earth. And basically what we've learned

1236
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:10,440
Speaker 5:  is that Chromos massively successful in schools and education

1237
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,960
Speaker 5:  really has not made any inroads in any interesting way anywhere else.

1238
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:19,160
Speaker 5:  And you know, who doesn't wanna buy lots of thousand dollar

1239
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:23,120
Speaker 5:  Chromebooks schools. Yeah. And so there was just, there was

1240
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,520
Speaker 5:  no way for the pixel book to continue to exist, which makes me very sad.

1241
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,240
Speaker 5:  But I also sort of understand.

1242
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,760
Speaker 4:  I really think that for a lot of people, a Chromebook is

1243
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,000
Speaker 4:  the best choice for a laptop.

1244
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,360
Speaker 5:  I agree. But the market does not agree with that. Believe it. I disagree

1245
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,760
Speaker 5:  to my bones. That

1246
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,200
Speaker 6:  That is true. I disagree. We already have people who Monica did that great

1247
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,120
Speaker 6:  story last year about people who were raised up on phones and pixel

1248
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,080
Speaker 6:  books. So they don't understand file hierarchies. And like, that's why

1249
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,880
Speaker 6:  I'm like, no Chromebooks are bad for your fulltime for computer.

1250
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:57,760
Speaker 4:  Like what Alex is like, what I need you to do is understand the concept of

1251
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,080
Speaker 4:  a file. Yes, yes. You're home. That's the first we're here for you.

1252
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,280
Speaker 4:  But I honestly, you know, the holidays are coming by

1253
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,880
Speaker 4:  your parents a Chromebook. It will make your life better. I will never get

1254
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,400
Speaker 4:  over. I mean, obviously some of you have parents who are very good at computers.

1255
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:17,160
Speaker 4:  They're fine. If you're like me and every time your parents call,

1256
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:21,160
Speaker 4:  it's like a knives out mystery to figure out how they broke the

1257
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:25,200
Speaker 4:  computer. Just get 'em a Chromebook. Yeah. Cause like, all

1258
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,680
Speaker 4:  they're doing is going to websites. Like that's all they really want to do.

1259
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:31,480
Speaker 4:  And the thing is really good at it. And then they have a phone for all the

1260
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,120
Speaker 4:  other stuff and they like use the phone to like do FaceTime calls. Like you

1261
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:37,560
Speaker 4:  don't, you don't need an app model on that device for that

1262
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,880
Speaker 4:  for like look at websites. Good. You

1263
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,040
Speaker 6:  Know? Yeah. I mean the Chromebook probably might make sense for a lot of

1264
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,880
Speaker 6:  older customers who, who maybe don't need a whole lot. They're retired. They're

1265
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,920
Speaker 6:  not doing like their taxes on the thing or anything like that. They have

1266
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:52,800
Speaker 6:  an accountant, but that, that those that younger the generation Z

1267
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,480
Speaker 6:  or whatever we wanna call it, those kids don't necessarily

1268
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:00,920
Speaker 6:  need or want just a little window to the internet. They've already got that.

1269
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,880
Speaker 6:  They've got their phone. They want something that can do a little bit, a

1270
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,760
Speaker 6:  lot more. Yeah. Not even a little bit, but a lot more stuff. So I

1271
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,000
Speaker 6:  think it makes sense that Chrome is not reaching out to those kids, especially

1272
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,360
Speaker 6:  because they also care more about their privacy. And

1273
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:18,200
Speaker 6:  you're just buying a window to Google when you buy a Chromebook,

1274
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:20,400
Speaker 6:  you're just saying, here's my data, Google.

1275
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,200
Speaker 4:  These are people who are buying windows, laptops, and then running Chrome.

1276
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:27,400
Speaker 6:  No they aren't though. They like, I cannot tell you how often I see the teens

1277
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,040
Speaker 6:  being like don't use Chrome. It's terrible. You have to go get Firefox.

1278
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:32,880
Speaker 6:  Save Firefox. No.

1279
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,040
Speaker 5:  Nope. There's like

1280
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:34,720
Speaker 6:  On TikTok and

1281
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,240
Speaker 5:  Stuff. I tell you confidently. That is not a real thing. That is happen.

1282
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:37,480
Speaker 5:  I

1283
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,480
Speaker 4:  Don't know what teens you're hanging. Swear.

1284
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,920
Speaker 6:  The teens, the teens love it. My

1285
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,440
Speaker 4:  About teenagers

1286
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,160
Speaker 5:  Go use Firefox.

1287
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:44,960
Speaker 6:  It cracks me up

1288
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,760
Speaker 4:  Every time here's a digression for you. I can't believe this.

1289
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,960
Speaker 4:  Hasn't come up on this show yet. Ford announced a new Mustang yesterday.

1290
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:55,120
Speaker 4:  Yes. It looks exactly the same as the old Mustang.

1291
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:59,040
Speaker 4:  They've added a crease to the back. Whatever on the inside looks totally

1292
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,400
Speaker 4:  different. They've added huge screens everywhere. Everywhere. Just it runs

1293
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,640
Speaker 4:  unreal engine. I think it doesn't run Android yet. They've really dicey,

1294
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,840
Speaker 6:  But it runs unreal engine.

1295
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,280
Speaker 4:  But yeah, they've got all these animations to, you know, cars now are video

1296
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,800
Speaker 4:  games and actually the PR is full of references to video games. They're like

1297
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,520
Speaker 4:  we made the dashboard look more like a video game. No, and it's like, it's

1298
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,400
Speaker 4:  weird. Don't do that. But there's this line in it. They've taken

1299
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,240
Speaker 4:  out the buttons and the knobs for the climate control and the

1300
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:29,200
Speaker 4:  radio. There's maybe a volume button. So, or a volume knob still. And

1301
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,040
Speaker 4:  the line is like we asked gen Z

1302
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,800
Speaker 4:  millennials and traditional Mustang owners and they all prefer

1303
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,240
Speaker 4:  having screens. And it's like, those are your three generations.

1304
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:43,080
Speaker 4:  There's gen Z. There's one animals

1305
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:43,720
Speaker 5:  Mustang.

1306
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,600
Speaker 4:  And then the generation that forever be known as traditional

1307
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,280
Speaker 4:  Mustang owners.

1308
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:53,680
Speaker 4:  It's like, alright, that's, you know, I've always been kind of on the border

1309
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,640
Speaker 4:  of gen X and I'm gonna a traditional Mustang

1310
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,920
Speaker 4:  owner from this point on.

1311
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:02,160
Speaker 5:  I actually feel like that describes you personally better than any other,

1312
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,160
Speaker 5:  other labels.

1313
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:07,560
Speaker 4:  It's like you wanna do Oregon trail? No, no, no. Traditional Mustang

1314
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,440
Speaker 4:  owner. That's that's always been me. I'm an old

1315
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:11,800
Speaker 4:  soul.

1316
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:16,160
Speaker 5:  Also Ford. You interviewed the wrong people a hundred percent. No, they

1317
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,480
Speaker 5:  no,

1318
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:17,240
Speaker 4:  Just

1319
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,280
Speaker 5:  Hard disagree.

1320
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:22,880
Speaker 4:  It's very funny. It's it's just such a confidently stated line in this

1321
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,520
Speaker 4:  press release too.

1322
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,560
Speaker 5:  But wait back to, to Alex's browser point, that's actually a really good

1323
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,200
Speaker 5:  segue into another thing we should talk about, which is Adobe buying Figma

1324
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,560
Speaker 5:  for 20 billion. Yes.

1325
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,000
Speaker 4:  Terrible.

1326
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:35,160
Speaker 5:  Because there are lots of reasons it's terrible. But one big thing.

1327
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,000
Speaker 5:  This is, is like a fundamental bet on web browsers. Like Fig's thing

1328
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,760
Speaker 5:  for a long time has been that like the web is a place for

1329
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,360
Speaker 5:  massively powerful apps and it has like built one of those things inside

1330
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,560
Speaker 5:  of web technology. And Adobe has been saying for a long time that it wants

1331
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,040
Speaker 5:  to build more of its tools into the web and has

1332
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,680
Speaker 5:  struggled pretty hard to do so. But like Scott Beski at Adobe has been talking

1333
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:00,480
Speaker 5:  about this forever. And this is like, this is going to be a push

1334
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,320
Speaker 5:  for them to do more stuff on the web. And I think my like theory slash

1335
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,320
Speaker 4:  If it doesn't get blocked

1336
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,240
Speaker 5:  Well, yeah, again, there are lots of reasons this might not happen, but might

1337
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,200
Speaker 5:  not. It might not be a bad idea, but like a window to websites is a much

1338
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,960
Speaker 5:  more powerful thing going forward then I think it has been

1339
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,680
Speaker 4:  Recently. Yes I, so I, there lots of big company, Microsoft, Spotify, whatever,

1340
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,480
Speaker 4:  where they're actually provisioning their designers, Chromebooks to run

1341
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,440
Speaker 4:  Figma. Oh wow. It's like a real thing that occurs. Oh, well I don't think

1342
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:30,320
Speaker 4:  Microsoft is provisioning. Chromebooks fair maybe, but Microsoft is getting,

1343
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,200
Speaker 4:  there's a great CNBC story that I think Tom link to today in his piece,

1344
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:38,480
Speaker 4:  just from a week ago, that Figma is like taking root inside of

1345
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,720
Speaker 4:  Microsoft and Microsoft, Adobe have been very cozy and like it's actually

1346
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,800
Speaker 4:  straining the relationship. Who knows? I do think that if you're in a world

1347
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,640
Speaker 4:  where Lena Kahn wants to block meta from buying supernatural

1348
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:54,240
Speaker 4:  an app that only runs on the quest because she's like,

1349
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:58,040
Speaker 4:  there's not enough competition. And everyone seems to want to stop

1350
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,800
Speaker 4:  Microsoft from buying Activision based on call of duty alone.

1351
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:05,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That Adobe, which has Adobe XD buying its

1352
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,640
Speaker 4:  only real competitor in Figma probably needs to get stopped. It

1353
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,920
Speaker 4:  maybe, maybe it's too wonky. You know, maybe, maybe the FTC doesn't know,

1354
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,720
Speaker 4:  know what Figma is, but in this world it's like a big,

1355
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,160
Speaker 4:  big deal. And so I don't we'll see. I, I would just imagine they're gonna

1356
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,040
Speaker 4:  charge head first into antitrust time.

1357
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:26,320
Speaker 6:  I just can't like, I, I feel the O Adobe has been

1358
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:30,480
Speaker 6:  this company. We always kind of dance around when it comes to antitrust because

1359
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,880
Speaker 6:  they, they have effective monopolies in a number of places, including like

1360
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,760
Speaker 6:  that, that image, you know, Photoshop, like it's Photoshop, you go

1361
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,160
Speaker 6:  somewhere and they say, can you do Photoshop? That's like, that's it.

1362
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:45,560
Speaker 6:  And I wonder why it's taken this long

1363
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,800
Speaker 6:  for the antitrust eye to even glance.

1364
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:52,560
Speaker 4:  Well, it hasn't glanced. They're like, we're gonna buy Figma. I mean,

1365
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:56,600
Speaker 6:  I feel like probably glancing right now for, I feel like Lena Conns on the

1366
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,240
Speaker 6:  verge right now. She's seen it. Yeah. She knows she's G

1367
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,760
Speaker 4:  Glanced, whatever. When Microsoft set out to my activation, there was like,

1368
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,640
Speaker 4:  there was a run up of like Microsoft

1369
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:10,920
Speaker 4:  executives saying how open they were gonna be like, you know, they accept

1370
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,800
Speaker 4:  the stage, you know? Like we love openness. We are gonna do

1371
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,720
Speaker 4:  our UB. Not we're good. Yeah. Right. And then when they announced it,

1372
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,600
Speaker 4:  they announced all these principles. They've been trying to say that

1373
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,520
Speaker 4:  call of duty. I think Tom has reported this. Like they sent a letter to

1374
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,160
Speaker 4:  Sony by just doing some math based on what they're saying. Yeah. It's

1375
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,680
Speaker 4:  seven years of a commitment. They haven't said seven years. Exactly.

1376
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:37,680
Speaker 4:  But they said a few more years in the existing deal. It's like, you just

1377
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,080
Speaker 4:  like, you have to like know like you can add it up. And it's like seven years.

1378
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,840
Speaker 4:  Like Microsoft did a lot of like pre-work around

1379
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,480
Speaker 4:  regulators to like butter them up into improving. Adobe's still not gonna

1380
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,320
Speaker 4:  succeed maybe. Right. Like it's still getting all this scrutiny.

1381
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:52,480
Speaker 4:  Adobe's like, I we're just mind Figma.

1382
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:57,040
Speaker 6:  So why somebody it's wild. Because I feel like I see

1383
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:01,280
Speaker 6:  more complaints about the monopoly at, at Adobe than I do

1384
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:05,240
Speaker 6:  even Google and Microsoft and Facebook and everybody else that we

1385
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,080
Speaker 6:  talk about be, excuse me, meta being these big antitrust nightmares.

1386
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:13,240
Speaker 4:  I think one of the reasons, well, one Photoshop is Photoshop. Yeah. There

1387
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,720
Speaker 4:  are a lot of competitors to Photoshop in the world. Yeah. Right. And the

1388
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:20,200
Speaker 4:  switching cost is actually like zero right apart from

1389
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,920
Speaker 4:  Photoshop files in the cloud or

1390
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,200
Speaker 6:  Whatever. But they're not like it's still, most people expect Photoshop to

1391
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,000
Speaker 6:  be the thing you use.

1392
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:29,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But that's just like, the market has picked a thing that you use, like

1393
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:34,080
Speaker 4:  Adobe is not out there locking you into Photoshop. Like the

1394
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,720
Speaker 4:  world of ad agencies is like, we use Photoshop, right? Like here's the skill

1395
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:41,640
Speaker 4:  you need to have to work at this. Company's fine. And then with XD

1396
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,400
Speaker 4:  the design program, like Figma was winning. Right? So like

1397
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,480
Speaker 4:  the, you know, like the people complain a lot about how much creative cloud

1398
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,400
Speaker 4:  costs and to become a young creative in the world. You gotta pay all

1399
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,280
Speaker 4:  this money a month just to show up at work. Yeah. I it's an expensive

1400
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:00,000
Speaker 4:  proposition and maybe they should be cheaper, but like one to one for those

1401
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,880
Speaker 4:  apps, like final cut exists. It is meaningful

1402
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,880
Speaker 4:  competition to premiere, I guess like

1403
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,440
Speaker 4:  there are lots of image editors that are not Photoshop. The fact that the

1404
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,200
Speaker 4:  industry is set a standard for its professional software, I think is

1405
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:19,400
Speaker 4:  like, fine. It's here where there's like a people are

1406
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,720
Speaker 4:  not using the Adobe app. They're using this app from a startup and Adobe's

1407
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,320
Speaker 4:  like, whatever, we're just buying it to foreclose competition that you, you

1408
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,160
Speaker 4:  get this scrutiny. Yeah. We'll see. I don't,

1409
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:31,880
Speaker 5:  That's what it seems to smell like to a lot of people. Right. Which is like,

1410
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,920
Speaker 5:  everybody has Facebook buying Instagram because Instagram was cool

1411
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:39,760
Speaker 5:  on their mind right now. And that is like, that looks an awful lot. Like

1412
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,800
Speaker 5:  what Adobe is doing here, they're saying, oh, they've figured out something.

1413
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,720
Speaker 5:  We can't. They're cool. We have to, we have to eat them before

1414
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:50,480
Speaker 5:  they eat us. And like, that is just, that is a dynamic, people

1415
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,560
Speaker 5:  are primed to see in a way that I think they have not been in a long time.

1416
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I don't know whether it's actually the case here. It certainly looks

1417
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,040
Speaker 5:  like it on its face, but it's gonna be interesting. But I would be willing

1418
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,600
Speaker 5:  to bet that the FTC has never once had a meeting about Adobe with the possible

1419
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,560
Speaker 5:  exception of like today or tomorrow. Like

1420
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,000
Speaker 6:  Do it,

1421
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,680
Speaker 4:  Do it, Adobe runs a gigantic ad business. Yeah. I think Adobe

1422
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:15,600
Speaker 4:  is fundamentally one of the most undercover companies in tech. I think

1423
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,360
Speaker 4:  it is absolutely fascinating and like totally agree. We have a new reporter

1424
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,760
Speaker 4:  in the UK trust weathered. She is creative. She's part of the creative community.

1425
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:26,160
Speaker 4:  Like she's, she's gonna write a story about the Figma community and the reaction

1426
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:30,000
Speaker 4:  to Adobe. And I'm excited to point her more directly to Adobe overall.

1427
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:33,600
Speaker 4:  Okay. Alex, I just want you to explain one more thing before we go. Okay.

1428
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,040
Speaker 6:  What's that?

1429
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,000
Speaker 4:  I'm just gonna read this headline that you wrote.

1430
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,360
Speaker 5:  Oh, I know what it is already. Hell yeah.

1431
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:39,640
Speaker 6:  It's a great

1432
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,800
Speaker 4:  Headline. I've I've read it so many times and I didn't read this story just

1433
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,320
Speaker 4:  because I was like, I'm gonna try to make Alex explain this to me. Disney's

1434
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,160
Speaker 4:  CEO teases, a quote, hard bundle of Disney

1435
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,600
Speaker 4:  plus and Hulu. And the sub-headline is the current

1436
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:57,600
Speaker 4:  soft bundle is so confusing. They have an ad campaign to explain

1437
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,200
Speaker 4:  it. And it turns out that I have no idea what any of this means.

1438
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:01,840
Speaker 4:  Alex,

1439
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,280
Speaker 5:  Could you tell us first all of your rejected headline ideas,

1440
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:09,560
Speaker 6:  They're not safe for the podcast community to

1441
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:09,800
Speaker 6:  hear,

1442
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:16,280
Speaker 6:  but yeah, I didn't know what a hard or a soft bundle

1443
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:19,440
Speaker 6:  was until this week. When, when

1444
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:23,680
Speaker 6:  Disney's CEO teased his stuff. Bob chap, where did he tease

1445
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:23,960
Speaker 6:  this?

1446
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:24,800
Speaker 4:  Bob two. Bob

1447
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,480
Speaker 6:  Two. I actually don't remember where he teased this. I wrote this whole blog

1448
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,400
Speaker 6:  and I forgot everything. Okay. So yeah, Bob chap spoke to

1449
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,920
Speaker 6:  the Los Angeles times this past weekend. They, he was at D

1450
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,600
Speaker 6:  23, which is Disney's big fan event. They announced a whole bunch of

1451
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:42,680
Speaker 6:  movies, Marvel news, star wars stuff, tons of trailers,

1452
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:46,480
Speaker 6:  new trailer for Willow, which only me and four other people are excited about.

1453
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,440
Speaker 6:  But boy are we excited? And he kept talking

1454
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,040
Speaker 6:  about hard and soft bundles. Like this was just part of the conversation

1455
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,960
Speaker 6:  they were having. And a soft bundle is, is when you take

1456
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:58,400
Speaker 6:  a whole bunch,

1457
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,840
Speaker 5:  It's imagining somebody going up to Bob in the middle and being like Bob,

1458
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,880
Speaker 5:  you know, people can hear you. Don't talk about this. Wait,

1459
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,120
Speaker 4:  What? Okay, what is a soft bundle?

1460
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:09,960
Speaker 6:  So a soft bundle is what, what we have have now, which is

1461
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:14,360
Speaker 6:  Hulu plus plus plus or whatever. They're calling it at the moment.

1462
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,200
Speaker 6:  So it's Hulu, it's the live TV. It's ESPN plus it's

1463
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,720
Speaker 6:  Disney plus that's a soft bundle. Most companies are doing this.

1464
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:25,520
Speaker 6:  HBO. Max is doing a soft bundle now with it and

1465
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,360
Speaker 6:  discovery go a hard bundle is just an

1466
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,160
Speaker 6:  app where all of the stuff is in one place. But instead of calling

1467
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,000
Speaker 6:  it an app, they called it a hard bundle.

1468
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:39,360
Speaker 4:  Okay. So a hard bundle is when they just make Hulu and Disney

1469
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,360
Speaker 4:  plus the same app.

1470
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:44,240
Speaker 6:  So, but Hulu Disney plus and ESPN, and it was really weird

1471
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:48,320
Speaker 6:  how he phrased it because he

1472
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:52,360
Speaker 6:  was talking about, it would be all of the experiences in one place.

1473
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:56,280
Speaker 6:  But somehow saying that was different than an app that was just Hulu

1474
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,440
Speaker 6:  and Disney plus merged together.

1475
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,120
Speaker 4:  Right. Cause, well, you don't wanna make, you don't wanna mix the Hulu shows

1476
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,720
Speaker 4:  with the Disney. So it's like an app with three tabs and that's a, yeah,

1477
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:08,320
Speaker 6:  I think it'll be like you click into it and you'd be like ESPN, like an app

1478
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,040
Speaker 6:  with sub apps.

1479
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:12,600
Speaker 4:  What would that app be called? Would it be called the Disney hard bundle?

1480
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:13,840
Speaker 6:  I hope so.

1481
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:16,120
Speaker 5:  Be called Bob's hard bundle. That's that's what

1482
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,040
Speaker 4:  We be called. That's it? That's the very chest. Everybody. We got

1483
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,920
Speaker 4:  to the inevitable conclusion of this conversation. We tried

1484
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,560
Speaker 4:  to avoid it for as long as we could. It took one minute and 18 seconds.

1485
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,600
Speaker 4:  Thank you, David. We're very sorry. Liam will be

1486
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,320
Speaker 4:  marking this episode as explicit. So kids guys tell your mom what happened

1487
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:39,120
Speaker 4:  here and you can have a conversation about that with your parents.

1488
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,480
Speaker 4:  I'm very sorry. That makes okay. It makes sense to me that they would like

1489
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,360
Speaker 4:  make everything one app. Yeah. Right. But doesn't ESPN have

1490
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,080
Speaker 4:  its own ESPN should be over there.

1491
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:53,000
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I think that's what they're trying to figure out. And also are

1492
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,880
Speaker 6:  they even gonna be able to buy Hulu because Comcast CEO this

1493
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,840
Speaker 6:  week also was like, Hey, I know that we're, everybody's expecting us to sell

1494
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,480
Speaker 6:  our 33% share to Disney, but maybe we want Hulu

1495
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,160
Speaker 6:  and it would make sense. Well

1496
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:09,720
Speaker 5:  That, and also the other thing Comcast said that I loved very much was

1497
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,920
Speaker 5:  basically intimate. That what if Hulu is actually worth

1498
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:16,560
Speaker 5:  1 trillion, they're like, we'll, we'll sell it to you.

1499
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:20,640
Speaker 5:  But it is the most expensive thing in the history of

1500
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,440
Speaker 5:  the universe. Disney. Do you still want it? But I will say to me the,

1501
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:28,280
Speaker 5:  the, like there's a, there's a lesser version of this, I think,

1502
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,560
Speaker 5:  which is basically just that they stay three separate things, but you have

1503
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,400
Speaker 5:  to get all of them. And I think that would not totally shock me if Disney

1504
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:39,400
Speaker 5:  is just like cable, this is the price. You get everything. It's

1505
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,640
Speaker 5:  cable again. And it's like, oh, you don't watch sports, but you wanna watch

1506
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,000
Speaker 5:  Disney movies. Like what's up everybody. It's 1992. Again,

1507
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:49,720
Speaker 5:  you're gonna pay for it. Yeah. And if Disney wants to fund all the stuff

1508
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,840
Speaker 5:  it wants to do, especially with ESPN, it's basically gonna have to force

1509
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,880
Speaker 5:  a lot of people who don't wanna watch sports to pay for sports. So I would

1510
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,240
Speaker 5:  not be at all shocked if that's where this lands,

1511
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:02,480
Speaker 4:  I'm required to say that Comcast is an investor in Fox

1512
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,280
Speaker 4:  media, parent company.

1513
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,880
Speaker 5:  We also made a Netflix show, which people should know. It's a good show.

1514
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:07,840
Speaker 5:  You should watch it. If you

1515
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,840
Speaker 4:  Haven't poly made a quibi show. That's a real thing that happened. It's

1516
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:15,400
Speaker 5:  I also really liked the bear on. Who's clear by now. I dunno if that's a

1517
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,720
Speaker 5:  disclosure, I should think it's very good.

1518
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,600
Speaker 4:  That's true. Yeah. I watch NFL prime time on ESPN plus every

1519
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,440
Speaker 4:  week. It's it's another disclosure. It's great show. Really great

1520
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,280
Speaker 4:  music. The end.

1521
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,680
Speaker 4:  Alright. We should wrap this up. We've gone way over, by the way. Speaking

1522
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:36,280
Speaker 4:  of Comcast, they're rolling out two gig speeds to millions people. I, you

1523
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,800
Speaker 4:  know, I usually have nothing but unre reserved scorn for this company,

1524
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:43,520
Speaker 4:  but you know, I don't believe so actually faster access is pretty good. That's

1525
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,240
Speaker 4:  true. But they're saying to millions. So if you've gotten two gig

1526
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,360
Speaker 4:  internet access from Comcast late, let me know. I'm I'm very

1527
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,880
Speaker 5:  Curious. And, and we'll all come over to your house. Hang

1528
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,600
Speaker 4:  Out. Oh, shouts Chris Welch. He's he totally scooped the center sub mini,

1529
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,200
Speaker 4:  which was announced it's 4 29. Yeah,

1530
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:58,560
Speaker 5:  That was great.

1531
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:02,400
Speaker 4:  Very good. Got that totally. Right. All right. Next

1532
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,040
Speaker 4:  Wednesday, David, you're doing the hotline, right?

1533
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:08,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We are gonna take all of people's burning apple questions. So

1534
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,400
Speaker 5:  if you, anything you wanna know that we didn't cover or stuff that you have

1535
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,160
Speaker 5:  feelings about, about apple 8 66 verge one, one, or

1536
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,960
Speaker 5:  I should say, if you don't want call or can't, for some reason you

1537
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,880
Speaker 5:  can record a voice memo and email it to vergecast@theverge.com. That

1538
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,400
Speaker 5:  works great too. All your apple questions send 'em along.

1539
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:29,600
Speaker 4:  And then on Monday we have a little mini series starting. Yeah. About the

1540
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,880
Speaker 4:  future of music on this show, which I think would be very good. Alex, do

1541
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,840
Speaker 4:  you have the first episode of that?

1542
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:37,360
Speaker 6:  Yes, I will be on the first episode of that. And I am talking with Charlie

1543
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:41,280
Speaker 6:  Harding, who is a music journalist and I believe

1544
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,520
Speaker 6:  also on the V media network with his podcast. Switched on pop.

1545
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:49,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Switched on pop. Right. It's great. Charlie has been on the

1546
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,960
Speaker 4:  other show that I'm not allowed to say in this show. That was a good episode.

1547
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:52,400
Speaker 4:  We talked about.

1548
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,640
Speaker 6:  You're not allowed to talk about it here. We only talk about the verge cast

1549
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:59,200
Speaker 6:  and switched on pop and it's a really, really good conversation.

1550
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,440
Speaker 6:  We revealed far too much about our musical taste. It was great.

1551
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,080
Speaker 4:  That's great. Speaking of the other show onco next week is Ryan Peterson.

1555
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,160
