Description: In this bonus episode of The Vergecast, Senior Reviewer Victoria Song sits down with a bunch of Verge staffers to talk about how they use AI tools in their everyday lives. Not all of it went smoothly — we definitely get into the ways these tools fall short — but we explore how AI can be used to help bedtime go more smoothly for parents, plan big cross-country moves, supplement your internet searches (always double-check!), and even vibe code an app for your next tabletop role-playing game.

If you have any examples where AI was useful to you, we’d love to hear them. (For what it’s worth, we’d also love to hear stories where it spectacularly failed.) Email us at vergecast@theverge.com or call us at 866-VERGE11, we love hearing from you.

00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:07,605
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of testing

3
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:12,125
Speaker 2:  cursed technology. I'm your friend V song and I'm here

4
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:15,445
Speaker 2:  with a special Sunday bonus episode. Yay.

5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,565
Speaker 2:  We're calling this AI for Normies. So

6
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:23,645
Speaker 2:  here's the concept. AI can be so open-ended, it's

7
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:27,245
Speaker 2:  really hard for the average person to know what it's good for.

8
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:31,885
Speaker 2:  And if you ask me, I don't think big tech is doing

9
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:35,685
Speaker 2:  such a great job at explaining that either. But

10
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:40,045
Speaker 2:  we here at The Verge dot com are a bunch of giant

11
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:44,165
Speaker 2:  nerds and we test all of this stuff for a living. So I've asked

12
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:48,125
Speaker 2:  a bunch of my colleagues to join me in talking about how they've used AI

13
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:52,045
Speaker 2:  in their everyday lives. And I'm not talking about the canned

14
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:55,645
Speaker 2:  demo examples that you hear at product launches that

15
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:59,445
Speaker 2:  don't actually seem all that useful in real life.

16
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:04,165
Speaker 2:  I wanted to know what they found to be actually helpful. And I

17
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:08,005
Speaker 2:  also wanted to know what doesn't work. We have a

18
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:11,645
Speaker 2:  mix of practical applications, some quirky ideas, and

19
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:15,805
Speaker 2:  personally I think my main use

20
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:19,965
Speaker 2:  is a little unhinged. So stick around for

21
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:22,125
Speaker 2:  The Vergecast and we'll see you after the break.

22
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,245
Speaker 2:  So Esther Cohen is our director of subscriptions at The Verge and she

23
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:12,525
Speaker 2:  recently used chat GT to help gather the information she needed before making

24
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:13,805
Speaker 2:  a really big decision.

25
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:18,365
Speaker 3:  So as of last week, our family of four made the really,

26
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:21,605
Speaker 3:  really big change of moving from New York City,

27
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:25,885
Speaker 3:  upper West side in New York City to Miami Beach

28
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:26,725
Speaker 3:  in Florida.

29
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:31,045
Speaker 2:  Moving is really tough. I moved not a couple of years

30
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:35,005
Speaker 2:  ago to New Jersey And I never wanna do it again.

31
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:39,045
Speaker 2:  I never wanna move ever again. I probably will, but you know, it's

32
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:42,765
Speaker 2:  really tough. It's really hard. And you said that

33
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:46,685
Speaker 2:  you were using AI to help you figure

34
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:49,725
Speaker 2:  out how to manage this logistical nightmare.

35
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:53,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah, so I use the, I found myself using AI

36
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:57,165
Speaker 3:  surprisingly a lot for my move in terms

37
00:02:57,225 --> 00:03:00,845
Speaker 3:  of planning, finding out information, finding

38
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:04,045
Speaker 3:  out kind of how things work locally. 'cause when you're moving to a new state

39
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:07,645
Speaker 3:  and a new city, like the way things work are just totally different.

40
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:12,165
Speaker 3:  But I would say the most helpful and surprising way in which I used AI

41
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:16,125
Speaker 3:  for this move was actually for budgeting. Specifically when you

42
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:19,845
Speaker 3:  move from Manhattan, New York to Florida,

43
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:24,255
Speaker 3:  your taxes are extremely different.

44
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:29,695
Speaker 3:  And things like how much utilities cost,

45
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,655
Speaker 3:  how much gas costs, how much traffic there is

46
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:37,255
Speaker 3:  during the day in your commute. And so calculating how many miles

47
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:39,335
Speaker 3:  your car lease should have,

48
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,935
Speaker 3:  I was like hanging out with Chad GPT all day asking those questions.

49
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:49,535
Speaker 3:  So I was very surprised. I surprised myself

50
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:51,455
Speaker 3:  by how much I used it every

51
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:55,335
Speaker 2:  Day. So one of, one of the things was AI that you know, people

52
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,775
Speaker 2:  have trouble with is having to double check that information. Did you find

53
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,615
Speaker 2:  that it's so far, I know, I know you just moved, so some of this

54
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:06,095
Speaker 2:  will bear out over time. Did you find that those calculations were

55
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,855
Speaker 2:  realistic? Were you worried about double checking stuff? Yeah,

56
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:13,775
Speaker 3:  So I'll take an example. Like basically figuring

57
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:17,375
Speaker 3:  out what our new salaries and take home pay was gonna be given the new tax

58
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:21,615
Speaker 3:  situation. So I did a lot of Chad GPT prompting of

59
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:24,655
Speaker 3:  like, if I make this much before taxes

60
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:29,205
Speaker 3:  And I live in Bow Harbor, Miami,

61
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:33,245
Speaker 3:  Florida And I am withholding as a single

62
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:36,405
Speaker 3:  or whatever information, I input, what's my take home pay gonna be.

63
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:40,725
Speaker 3:  The first few times I did different versions of that. I did double check

64
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:44,525
Speaker 3:  just to make sure, but part of why I leaned into GGPT

65
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:44,965
Speaker 3:  was because

66
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:50,325
Speaker 3:  I find doing math that is like related to different facts

67
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:54,005
Speaker 3:  and like tax rules extremely, extremely daunting and overwhelming.

68
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,525
Speaker 3:  So I, before I even get to the math, I'm like, do I even have the setup right?

69
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,605
Speaker 3:  So I found JGPT super helpful 'cause all I did was feed it like my,

70
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,845
Speaker 3:  what I needed to know. And then it did all that math for me. It explained

71
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:09,605
Speaker 3:  all that math for me and I'm happy to report we just got our

72
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:13,425
Speaker 3:  first or second paycheck as a family with

73
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:16,785
Speaker 3:  based in Florida and the math pretty much

74
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:21,025
Speaker 3:  checked out down to the cent. So this is not a CHA

75
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:24,945
Speaker 3:  GPT endorsement, but for tax and budget and

76
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:28,145
Speaker 3:  salary planning, it was very accurate and helpful.

77
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:31,905
Speaker 2:  Would you say that this was basically kind of

78
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:36,465
Speaker 2:  making your life a lot easier as far as like pre-planning

79
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:40,385
Speaker 2:  the move, but also were there any things that you

80
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:43,985
Speaker 2:  tried to pre to like use chat GPT for your move that didn't

81
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:47,825
Speaker 2:  work out and you were like, Ooh, this is not what, what I should be using

82
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:48,545
Speaker 2:  AI for?

83
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:52,745
Speaker 3:  Yeah, so I would say great question. So it did make

84
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:56,705
Speaker 3:  my life a lot easier because I got to a couple dead ends where I would've

85
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:59,845
Speaker 3:  had to, to like hire an accountant for example, to figure things out for

86
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:03,725
Speaker 3:  me. And I was able to just like chat GP t it up and that was

87
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:07,365
Speaker 3:  like an expense saved and time saved and kind of like

88
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:10,805
Speaker 3:  having to hire one more service or one more person like that got taken off

89
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:14,085
Speaker 3:  the plate and that was really helpful. Where it was not helpful was

90
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:18,445
Speaker 3:  for, I found for shopping around or getting estimates of things.

91
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:22,565
Speaker 3:  So like I wanted to figure out, a thing that would've

92
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:26,485
Speaker 3:  been extremely helpful for me was like what's the the right car

93
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:30,285
Speaker 3:  for us given the kind of size that we need our budget. And

94
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:33,925
Speaker 3:  also thinking about what the cost to insure it is. So again,

95
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:38,085
Speaker 3:  this is moving and car rabbit hole, but sometimes even

96
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:41,925
Speaker 3:  if a car lease is cheaper, it'll be more expensive to insure it if it's not

97
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:45,765
Speaker 3:  as as safe of a car or if, or sometimes like crossovers are cheaper to insure

98
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:49,605
Speaker 3:  than sedans. So I would've loved for chat you to tell me, okay, get

99
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,765
Speaker 3:  this particular car model because even though the lease will be a little

100
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:56,005
Speaker 3:  more, the insurance will go down. So it sucked at that. It did not gimme

101
00:06:56,365 --> 00:07:00,285
Speaker 3:  accurate like lease pricing. It did not gimme accurate insurance pricing.

102
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:02,765
Speaker 3:  I had to get on the phone with the insurance broker and like figure all that

103
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:06,725
Speaker 3:  out and call all different insurance comp companies before I got to the right

104
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:10,525
Speaker 3:  one. So it was really, really bad at that. Same with movers, like I wanted

105
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:14,245
Speaker 3:  to get a sense of like how much will it cost to move a family of four in

106
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:18,085
Speaker 3:  a three bedroom apartment from Manhattan to Florida. And

107
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:22,045
Speaker 3:  it did a lot of like basic Google answers. Like

108
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:26,165
Speaker 3:  it could be anywhere between $6,000 and $27,000 depending on the

109
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:30,125
Speaker 3:  following factors. So I did not find it

110
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,565
Speaker 3:  helpful when it came to shopping arounds. That would've been really nice

111
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,885
Speaker 3:  if I could have had more help with that.

112
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,245
Speaker 2:  Another question I had is like how long did it take you to kind of figure

113
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:42,365
Speaker 2:  out that, oh this is something like this is something that I can

114
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:45,925
Speaker 2:  do, here's how I ask the AI the appropriate

115
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:49,645
Speaker 2:  prompts to kind of get the answers that I need. 'cause I found that like

116
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:53,525
Speaker 2:  when I am experimenting or using with different AI models, like

117
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:57,405
Speaker 2:  the, the real key is learning how to ask the question

118
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:01,485
Speaker 2:  correctly. And I spend a, I spent a lot of time in the beginning while

119
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:05,205
Speaker 2:  testing, just learning how to ask the question. So I'm just curious

120
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,805
Speaker 2:  how long that took you to kind of get in the groove.

121
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:11,125
Speaker 3:  It took me a minute to figure out what the right way to approach this was

122
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,965
Speaker 3:  with chat GPTI did a lot of like explain to me how

123
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:18,725
Speaker 3:  taxes in Florida work kind of prompts in the beginning and those

124
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:22,605
Speaker 3:  were other failures and did not get me the info that I needed. I thought

125
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:26,525
Speaker 3:  I could get the tools to do the math myself. And then I finally realized,

126
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:30,605
Speaker 3:  oh, what if this, I really just treated like an accountant and

127
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:34,005
Speaker 3:  I'm like, here's how much I'm making. Here's my paperwork,

128
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:37,965
Speaker 3:  figure out how much I'm gonna take home every month. Once I did that And

129
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:41,925
Speaker 3:  I figured out I, I can literally redo my prompt. It was like, if I make x

130
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:45,845
Speaker 3:  amount of money and have this many dependents and live

131
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:49,765
Speaker 3:  in my neighborhood, how much take home pay? Will I

132
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:53,725
Speaker 3:  bring every paycheck or something? And it literally

133
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:57,245
Speaker 3:  was able to do the math, explain to me what all the different like

134
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:01,085
Speaker 3:  deductions and with sorry withholdings are, lay that all out

135
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:04,325
Speaker 3:  for me and then give me a yearly amount and a monthly amount. So that was

136
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:08,125
Speaker 3:  amazing, but it did take me a minute to get there. 'cause I, I think as someone

137
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:11,885
Speaker 3:  who is a collaborator and likes to figure things out on my own,

138
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,125
Speaker 3:  my first approach was like, okay, let me ask Chad GPT for the tools to figure

139
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:20,045
Speaker 3:  this out. And it took me a few steps before I was like, no, the

140
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:23,885
Speaker 3:  whole point is that I don't want the tools. I want Chad GPT to

141
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:28,415
Speaker 3:  do the figuring out for me. Once I did that, it was smooth sailing.

142
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:31,935
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's, it's, it's sort of like a, a catch

143
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:35,735
Speaker 2:  22 because you have to know what you want, but you're also trying to

144
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:39,815
Speaker 2:  go in without knowing what you want and figure these things out. So like

145
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:43,695
Speaker 2:  I find that I spin wheels a lot of times when I'm trying to, trying to really

146
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:47,215
Speaker 2:  get my answers. So then if you could do this move all over again,

147
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:51,095
Speaker 2:  or if you have, if we have listeners out there who are,

148
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:55,455
Speaker 2:  you know, on The Verge of a move, do you have any advice

149
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:55,855
Speaker 2:  for them?

150
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:59,855
Speaker 3:  If you need to lay something out very clearly

151
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:03,975
Speaker 3:  before making a decision to move, like whether it's your budget for moving,

152
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:07,775
Speaker 3:  what your new salary is gonna be, any kind of

153
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:12,175
Speaker 3:  logistical problem that you're trying to solve as your decision making, g

154
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:15,215
Speaker 3:  pcha, gp PT is your friend. I find sometimes when we're making a really,

155
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:15,935
Speaker 3:  really big,

156
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:20,935
Speaker 3:  daunting life decision, what I personally struggle with

157
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:25,655
Speaker 3:  is when there's so many moving pieces before you can even

158
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:29,455
Speaker 3:  make the decision. Like, so like I, I personally really

159
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:33,175
Speaker 3:  struggle with like the whole, there's so much to figure out before we even

160
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:36,975
Speaker 3:  do the thing of it all, that it's actually been really,

161
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:40,615
Speaker 3:  really nice to have a tool that like

162
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:44,525
Speaker 3:  got rid of I would say three quarters of that, right? Like

163
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:48,645
Speaker 3:  there isn't that much to figure out. We can figure it out with our computer

164
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:53,245
Speaker 3:  and like with a glass of wine in two hours. I can do a lot of that like

165
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:57,965
Speaker 3:  figuring out like the groundwork before actually having to

166
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:01,885
Speaker 3:  make a decision or do the big thing. And that was like personally

167
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:05,965
Speaker 3:  and like emotionally a huge, a huge crutch and a huge

168
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:06,485
Speaker 3:  help for me.

169
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:10,885
Speaker 2:  I love that. Thank you so much. I'm how, how far are you along? Are you on

170
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:14,765
Speaker 2:  unpacking? Are we, are we like 10% of the way there? 0%

171
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:16,085
Speaker 2:  of the way? There we're

172
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:17,725
Speaker 3:  Like 3% of the way there.

173
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:23,325
Speaker 2:  I mean, I, I moved over a year ago And

174
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:27,445
Speaker 2:  I think 18 months ago maybe. And I'm still somewhat

175
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:30,965
Speaker 2:  unpacking, so yeah. Yeah, that's just how it goes,

176
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:35,365
Speaker 2:  g Godspeed. Good luck and all right, thanks Esther.

177
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:35,925
Speaker 2:  Thanks

178
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:38,165
Speaker 3:  V Love talking to you. Bye.

179
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:42,925
Speaker 2:  Next up Allison Johnson is our senior smartphone

180
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:46,725
Speaker 2:  reviewer, which means she's had to test a lot of different AI

181
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:50,485
Speaker 2:  assistance over the last two years. Here's what she found most useful.

182
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:52,365
Speaker 2:  Definitely my favorite,

183
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,165
Speaker 4:  Like, and it's not even close, is using

184
00:11:56,585 --> 00:12:00,565
Speaker 4:  AI to put stuff on calendars. I don't know how it's possible

185
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:04,005
Speaker 4:  to be bad at calendars, but I am bad at doing

186
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:08,245
Speaker 4:  calendars. If there's like a way to mess up putting something on a

187
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:12,285
Speaker 4:  calendar, I will do it. Like without fail, I'll put something on the wrong

188
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:13,085
Speaker 4:  day or

189
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,805
Speaker 4:  the wrong calendar. And my husband's like, what are you talking about? You

190
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:21,445
Speaker 4:  don't have an appointment this weekend? I'm like, actually I do. So the bar

191
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:25,245
Speaker 4:  is already really low. I think that's important that like AI

192
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,005
Speaker 4:  really can't mess this up more than I am already messing it up.

193
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:33,765
Speaker 4:  So it's the perfect candidate for like a

194
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:37,685
Speaker 4:  BAI can do this. This has been something that's been like in the

195
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:41,045
Speaker 4:  works with Gemini on Android phones for a while.

196
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:42,045
Speaker 4:  And

197
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:46,525
Speaker 4:  I like, to be honest, the first like

198
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:51,245
Speaker 4:  few weeks, maybe a month, I tried it, it like consistently

199
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:55,205
Speaker 4:  got stuff wrong and like would insist that I

200
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:59,125
Speaker 4:  was leaving. I had a flight out of the wrong airport And

201
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:03,165
Speaker 4:  I was like ready to give up on this whole concept, but it's, I don't know

202
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:06,605
Speaker 4:  what they did, they did something behind the scenes. It works, it like

203
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,405
Speaker 4:  works so well

204
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,925
Speaker 4:  that I am just like never gonna

205
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:17,725
Speaker 4:  do my own calendar again. I think on an Android

206
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:21,525
Speaker 4:  phone you'll like summon Gemini and you

207
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:25,485
Speaker 4:  tap something that says ask about this screen and then if

208
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,685
Speaker 4:  there's it, it'll kind of like take a screenshot and it looks for dates and

209
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:33,325
Speaker 4:  stuff. And if this sounds like

210
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:35,445
Speaker 4:  did we need AI to do that?

211
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:40,645
Speaker 4:  Yes and no. It'll, it, it's really smart actually.

212
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:44,565
Speaker 4:  It'll ask you like follow up questions about what's on the screen.

213
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,205
Speaker 4:  It can sort out like time zones,

214
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:52,685
Speaker 4:  like it will, will put something on my calendar

215
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:55,645
Speaker 4:  for the correct Eastern time time zone

216
00:13:57,105 --> 00:14:00,925
Speaker 4:  and that that'll be reflected. So it's like, it's

217
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:04,885
Speaker 4:  the ideal kind of like AI tool I think where

218
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:08,405
Speaker 4:  it's, it's sort of low stakes. I wasn't doing it

219
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:12,045
Speaker 4:  great to begin with and it's pretty easy.

220
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:17,325
Speaker 4:  So I, that's like my first AI on

221
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:21,325
Speaker 4:  a phone thing where I'm like, yes, a hundred percent I want this and

222
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:23,765
Speaker 4:  I'm going to keep using it for the rest of time.

223
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:28,025
Speaker 2:  And so this is like android, Android phones only. There's

224
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:30,185
Speaker 2:  no hope for us on iOS yet.

225
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:34,225
Speaker 4:  There is Hope iOS has it. It is an Apple intelligence

226
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:37,785
Speaker 4:  feature. It's like pretty good.

227
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:42,985
Speaker 4:  I would say not as good as Gemini. It doesn't do the like follow

228
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,665
Speaker 4:  up questions. It did get tripped up on a time zone

229
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:51,205
Speaker 4:  thing once. But again, if the bar is

230
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:54,565
Speaker 4:  very low for you and it is for me, it's like

231
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:58,645
Speaker 4:  something to start with. And then you, you fix a couple things and

232
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:00,085
Speaker 4:  and you usually get there.

233
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:04,365
Speaker 2:  So like what's been most useful for you in terms of like these calendar

234
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:08,445
Speaker 2:  adding, is it like flights? Is it, I don't know, I

235
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:11,805
Speaker 2:  don't have kids, but I have been told by parents that

236
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:15,525
Speaker 2:  kids schedules are absolutely banana bonkers

237
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:19,565
Speaker 2:  appointments is everything, like is there a particular thing

238
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:23,285
Speaker 2:  that this calendar AI Magic is, is best for?

239
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:27,445
Speaker 4:  It is a hundred percent the kids stuff And I didn't fully

240
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:31,525
Speaker 4:  grasp it until you have a kid in school or like my kid's in

241
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:35,365
Speaker 4:  daycare. But it's like a preschool program and you'll get an email

242
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:39,245
Speaker 4:  with the most insane list of dates and

243
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:43,005
Speaker 4:  it's like crazy Hair day is Friday and it like, the

244
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:46,805
Speaker 4:  information will not be complete. You know, it's like Raptor

245
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:50,725
Speaker 4:  visit on such and such day, wear

246
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:54,605
Speaker 4:  your pajamas to school on this day and going through

247
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:58,285
Speaker 4:  all those things and adding on a calendar manually is a

248
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:01,645
Speaker 4:  nightmare. And also it sucks if you send your kid to pajama day and they're

249
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:05,365
Speaker 4:  not wearing pajamas. Like, it's so sad. But this is like

250
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:09,205
Speaker 4:  a thousand percent the best use case for it. 'cause you do the

251
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:13,165
Speaker 4:  screenshot, it scans the whole thing and it's like, I

252
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:16,965
Speaker 4:  added all this to your calendar and then, then your kid isn't like

253
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,485
Speaker 4:  sad when they show up on crazy hair day. But to be

254
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:24,605
Speaker 4:  fair, my kid has crazy hair day every day. So we're covered there,

255
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:27,885
Speaker 2:  But my immigrant parents would've been like, you're not doing that. Just

256
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,645
Speaker 2:  be sad. So like,

257
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:33,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah, maybe I'm depriving him of like a learning

258
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:38,325
Speaker 4:  experience where it's like, well sometimes you don't do crazy

259
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:42,365
Speaker 4:  hair day on the right day. But for the most part

260
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,325
Speaker 4:  I think it's been good for everybody.

261
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:47,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Is there anything else that you found particularly useful?

262
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:52,005
Speaker 4:  We were having like the worst time with

263
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:55,805
Speaker 4:  kid bedtime. This is a thing that happens throughout like early

264
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:59,565
Speaker 4:  parenthood. Like kids sleeps great. You're like,

265
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:03,645
Speaker 4:  this is amazing. I can read a book and like relax at night and then

266
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:06,805
Speaker 4:  all of a sudden it goes completely off the rails and you're like

267
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:11,045
Speaker 4:  negotiating every little tiny thing and you're like, please, dear God,

268
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:15,125
Speaker 4:  I just, I need this hour to myself. So I was like

269
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,325
Speaker 4:  kind of desperate And I went to the, to the AI

270
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,445
Speaker 4:  And I was like, describe the situation we're having his age. And like,

271
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:28,085
Speaker 4:  I was like, get help me out. Like what can we do? And it goes and

272
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:31,965
Speaker 4:  finds whatever relevant like things on Reddit, there are like,

273
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:35,845
Speaker 4:  it's, it's always Reddit, like there's so many parenting things on

274
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:39,685
Speaker 4:  Reddit, but it kind of like brought it all back and was like, you

275
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:43,485
Speaker 4:  could try this, this, and this. And I was like, okay, I wanna

276
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:47,405
Speaker 4:  try this thing and this thing. Can you put this all together

277
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:50,885
Speaker 4:  in a a a I called it a playbook

278
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:55,485
Speaker 4:  'cause like I needed to communicate it to my husband and right.

279
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:59,565
Speaker 4:  He, he will get overwhelmed if I just kind of sit down.

280
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:03,445
Speaker 4:  I'm like, we're doing this thing. He has two passes, he can use the passes.

281
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:06,485
Speaker 4:  We sit for five minutes and the, you know, it's like so

282
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:10,245
Speaker 4:  convoluted, but it spit it all, it, it like

283
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:14,285
Speaker 4:  explained everything. There were subheads. It was very

284
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:15,045
Speaker 4:  like logical.

285
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:20,765
Speaker 4:  And the funniest thing is the thing it could not

286
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:24,725
Speaker 4:  do. I was like, great, can you put this in a Google doc for me? And

287
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:27,405
Speaker 4:  I was like, I'm sorry, I can't,

288
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:29,165
Speaker 4:  I don't

289
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:31,325
Speaker 2:  Understand. It's your Gemini though. I know.

290
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:32,165
Speaker 4:  I'm like, this is the Google

291
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:32,925
Speaker 2:  Platform.

292
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:37,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like I have all the little like plugins for all the,

293
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:40,125
Speaker 4:  I don't know why it couldn't do a Google Doc, but it literally was like,

294
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:44,325
Speaker 4:  you can use command, you know, v or whatever, like

295
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:47,565
Speaker 4:  copy and paste it and it the, I was like, okay,

296
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,925
Speaker 4:  don't explain copying and pasting to me machine.

297
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,405
Speaker 4:  But the, the kicker is like, this honestly

298
00:18:56,545 --> 00:19:00,165
Speaker 4:  did work. Like it's, it's probably a little more complicated

299
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:04,365
Speaker 4:  than it needs to be. And we've, we've like tweaked the system a little

300
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:08,205
Speaker 4:  bit. But like, I sent my husband the playbook, he

301
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:11,965
Speaker 4:  read it like we, we went into

302
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:15,845
Speaker 4:  bedtime, like just ready. We were like a united

303
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:19,725
Speaker 4:  front and, and it has worked. So

304
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:24,085
Speaker 4:  did, did Gemini just like read a bunch of Reddit

305
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:27,965
Speaker 4:  threads back to me and like format it probably.

306
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:33,285
Speaker 4:  Do I feel good about that? I don't, I'm not a hundred percent sure

307
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:36,445
Speaker 4:  but like I, I need that kid to go to sleep

308
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:42,245
Speaker 4:  and that has happened. So I, I'm like, well, alright,

309
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:46,805
Speaker 2:  My real life bedtime story AI thing was like, for a while

310
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,885
Speaker 2:  I was just like really struggling to fall asleep. So my

311
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:54,525
Speaker 2:  spouse actually was just asking AI to generate

312
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:58,965
Speaker 2:  bedtime stories for me. Like I was a child. That's

313
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:02,445
Speaker 2:  a adorable, just like based on our family.

314
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:06,765
Speaker 2:  So like, aw, they generated a story about

315
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:10,725
Speaker 2:  my cat Pete becoming a cult leader and how

316
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:14,325
Speaker 2:  Pablo our other cat brought upon his downfall.

317
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:18,765
Speaker 2:  And I don't know what prompt they used, but it was

318
00:20:18,795 --> 00:20:21,445
Speaker 2:  like kind of good. And

319
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:22,165
Speaker 4:  Oh my God,

320
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:26,365
Speaker 2:  If I were to like try and publish the story, I wouldn't because it's just

321
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:30,165
Speaker 2:  so hyper specific. But if I just needed like a quick really

322
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:33,965
Speaker 2:  funny bedtime story to listen to for

323
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,125
Speaker 2:  myself to fall asleep,

324
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:40,645
Speaker 2:  we've actually kind of done that every once in a while and

325
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:44,005
Speaker 2:  just been like, oh my gosh. Absolutely shocked. So yeah,

326
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:48,765
Speaker 2:  it was like, forget the title of it, it, but it was just like, PD

327
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:52,725
Speaker 2:  starts a cult was the title And I was the number

328
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:56,685
Speaker 2:  one cult follower. I didn't use any critical thinking, oh my in this AI story.

329
00:20:57,185 --> 00:21:01,045
Speaker 2:  And I was like, oh, that's actually quite accurate. Pablo, our other

330
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:04,085
Speaker 2:  cat would be the one to what? Like what is,

331
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,645
Speaker 4:  What is a cat if not a cult leader, where

332
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:08,885
Speaker 2:  They like, yeah. So you

333
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:11,885
Speaker 4:  Do their bidding, they're a little bit evil.

334
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:16,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean like ideally it would, would it have meant more if my spouse

335
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:20,285
Speaker 2:  had actually written that story and, and like

336
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:24,445
Speaker 2:  presented it? Yes, but I needed, I am the child in this

337
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:25,005
Speaker 2:  scenario.

338
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:26,165
Speaker 4:  I needed oh gosh,

339
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,805
Speaker 2:  To go to bed right away. So they just like whipped it up

340
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:34,325
Speaker 2:  and that was like a good running saga for a week.

341
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:35,205
Speaker 2:  And I was like, yeah,

342
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:36,365
Speaker 4:  I love that.

343
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:40,045
Speaker 2:  This is actually kind of cute and adorable. So, you know, I wish just, I

344
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:40,165
Speaker 2:  would

345
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:43,445
Speaker 4:  A hundred percent read Pete the cult leader, by the way.

346
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:47,085
Speaker 2:  I'll see if I can get the transcript because that was please,

347
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:51,895
Speaker 2:  that was truly just fundamentally the most,

348
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:55,415
Speaker 2:  I, you know, I actually almost didn't go to bed. I was laughing so hard.

349
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:56,175
Speaker 2:  Right?

350
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,495
Speaker 4:  That's the danger. It was.

351
00:21:57,765 --> 00:22:01,455
Speaker 2:  That is the danger. But we're just trying to help people go to bed,

352
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:03,815
Speaker 2:  help their kids go to bed. We just want some rest.

353
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:05,415
Speaker 4:  We all just want some rest.

354
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:10,575
Speaker 2:  That's, that's all we want. Thank you Allison. I I'm sure the

355
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:13,935
Speaker 2:  parents will now have some other tools in their arsenal.

356
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:19,095
Speaker 4:  Please. Yeah, message me on threads. We'll, we'll brainstorm, we'll bring

357
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:22,975
Speaker 4:  Gemini into it. Yeah, we, we'll get through it together.

358
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:27,375
Speaker 2:  So we're gonna go to break and when we come back, Jake will tell me his

359
00:22:27,405 --> 00:22:31,295
Speaker 2:  tips for how to best use AI for search. 'cause you

360
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:34,975
Speaker 2:  know, AI sometimes do be lying. See you soon.

361
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:10,645
Speaker 2:  We are back. So it's pretty hard to search for anything on the web these

362
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:14,525
Speaker 2:  days without an AI large language model butting in and telling

363
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:18,325
Speaker 2:  you to put glue on pizza or something like that. Jake Kakis is our

364
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:22,205
Speaker 2:  executive editor and he's been figuring out how to use AI

365
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:25,805
Speaker 2:  to help him find actually accurate information.

366
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:28,365
Speaker 2:  A thing that I thought could not be done

367
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:32,485
Speaker 13:  Well for one, I it is actually changing how

368
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:36,605
Speaker 13:  I search online. You know, I think for good reason people are are very skeptical

369
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:40,325
Speaker 13:  of using Chachi, BT or Gemini as a search engine, right? Sometimes it's

370
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:43,605
Speaker 13:  wrong. It is. That is In fact very true. But one thing that's interesting

371
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:47,405
Speaker 13:  is that over the years I've heard Google executives saying like, oh, you

372
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:50,645
Speaker 13:  know, all all these kids, all these people who, who grew up smartphone first,

373
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:54,405
Speaker 13:  you know, they, they don't, they don't search the same way all of us do,

374
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:58,005
Speaker 13:  right? And I, I'm in my mid thirties, I think anybody, you know, my age,

375
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:01,965
Speaker 13:  anybody who's been using Google for, for decades, when, when you do a search,

376
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:05,645
Speaker 13:  right, you, you're very precise and specific, right? You, you enter a couple

377
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:09,885
Speaker 13:  keywords to get exactly what you want, right? If, if you want to figure

378
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:13,805
Speaker 13:  out how much RAM the iPhone 16 has you, you just type in iPhone

379
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,845
Speaker 13:  16 ram, you're not gonna type out that whole question. They's a bunch of

380
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:20,685
Speaker 13:  extra words, they're gonna get filtered out. They might, you know,

381
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:25,005
Speaker 13:  pull up search results you don't want with chat CB t it, you really do

382
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:28,925
Speaker 13:  just type in the question. And that allows you to get more specific

383
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:33,245
Speaker 13:  and get nuances that you wouldn't be able to get. And, and this might, okay,

384
00:25:33,245 --> 00:25:36,965
Speaker 13:  my example right now is one that I use for work, but I think it, it, it

385
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:40,645
Speaker 13:  shows what these tools can do in a way that a normal search engine couldn't.

386
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:44,325
Speaker 13:  So recently we covered that Reddit says it wants to become a search engine,

387
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,685
Speaker 13:  right? That's like, that's really weird. That's a big idea. And so

388
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:52,285
Speaker 13:  I wanted to make sure, okay, has Reddit said before that it wants to become

389
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:56,225
Speaker 13:  a search engine? So I went to Google, right, typed in Reddit search

390
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:59,265
Speaker 13:  engine. Well that's not a very good search because

391
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:04,625
Speaker 13:  number one it it, first off you just get a ton of results of

392
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:08,545
Speaker 13:  of from Reddit, right? All the results are from Reddit about search engines.

393
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:11,745
Speaker 13:  Okay, well so now you gotta, you gotta know how to filter out Reddit searches.

394
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:15,265
Speaker 13:  That's easy. So I filter out Reddit searches. Now it's just a bunch of stories

395
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:18,865
Speaker 13:  about how everybody's using the Google hack where you just type in Reddit

396
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:22,825
Speaker 13:  to your search, right? Okay. So because the, the, the keyword

397
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:26,745
Speaker 13:  search is, is too messy, there's too many results, I

398
00:26:26,745 --> 00:26:30,265
Speaker 13:  can't actually find what I need here. So I go to chat GBT to see, okay,

399
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:33,985
Speaker 13:  can it find this for me? So I type in, hey, I'm looking for examples of

400
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:38,585
Speaker 13:  Reddit, the company or its executives saying that they

401
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:42,505
Speaker 13:  want the company to be seen as or operate

402
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:43,460
Speaker 13:  like a search engine.

403
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:48,965
Speaker 13:  And that's like pretty specific, right? And it's able to sort through

404
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:51,965
Speaker 13:  all of that and it came back to me with a bunch of results and it says,

405
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:55,925
Speaker 13:  okay, Reddit hasn't said it wants to become a search engine,

406
00:26:56,105 --> 00:27:00,005
Speaker 13:  but here are some similar quotes from

407
00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:03,975
Speaker 13:  executives where they're saying things about how

408
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:07,655
Speaker 13:  Reddit's thinking about search or how search is a valuable opportunity.

409
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,895
Speaker 13:  And so it's able to, you know, sift through all these

410
00:27:12,145 --> 00:27:15,575
Speaker 13:  other stories that are irrelevant, but have the right keywords and find

411
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:19,335
Speaker 13:  the specific things. Now here's the trick, right? Everybody's worried about

412
00:27:21,065 --> 00:27:24,645
Speaker 13:  AI being wrong, right? And I think when it comes to quotations,

413
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:28,525
Speaker 13:  that's an area where AI is really likely to make stuff up. And so

414
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:31,605
Speaker 13:  particularly for our jobs, we have to make sure everything is correct. And

415
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:35,565
Speaker 13:  so fortunately, you know, now CH A BT does the thing where it

416
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:38,445
Speaker 13:  will give you web links. So I clicked through these and in this case they

417
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:41,685
Speaker 13:  were all right. And so that was fantastic, that was really useful. And I

418
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:45,125
Speaker 13:  was able to use this to help me suss out whether they had made claims like

419
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:49,005
Speaker 13:  this before. I will say as a counter example, I tried a very

420
00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:52,885
Speaker 13:  similar thing when Apple said, okay, we're gonna make all

421
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:56,845
Speaker 13:  of the glass for the iPhones in the us. And I was

422
00:27:56,845 --> 00:28:00,755
Speaker 13:  like, okay, Che GBT, how much of

423
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:04,675
Speaker 13:  the glass is already made in the us? And it just, it just

424
00:28:04,675 --> 00:28:07,475
Speaker 13:  made up a quote, it just made up a quote for me. Yeah, right. So you gotta

425
00:28:07,475 --> 00:28:10,955
Speaker 13:  check. You have to check. But I think it's the same thing with right, with

426
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:14,155
Speaker 13:  Google where you have to have the skillset.

427
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:18,515
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, this is like a super interesting example because I have a much

428
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:22,475
Speaker 2:  sillier problem that really mirrors what you were saying. Like,

429
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:27,435
Speaker 2:  so I have been watching Law and Order SVU because I found

430
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:30,475
Speaker 2:  out my spouse had never seen an episode of Law and Order recently. And I

431
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,195
Speaker 2:  was like, what this is

432
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,035
Speaker 13:  Are there are like 900, there's

433
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:36,875
Speaker 2:  Like 20 thou, there's 24 or 25 seasons of

434
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:40,715
Speaker 2:  law and order. S-V-U-I-I actually wasn't aware that

435
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:44,635
Speaker 2:  it was still going, but we started watching it and you know,

436
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:50,155
Speaker 2:  he had seen clips before and he is like, I did ice, does ice tea

437
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:53,355
Speaker 2:  always have a ponytail in, in law and order

438
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:57,275
Speaker 2:  SVU. And I was like, well, you know, he changes up his, look, I don't recall

439
00:28:57,295 --> 00:29:00,435
Speaker 2:  him wearing suits all the time either in the first season.

440
00:29:01,195 --> 00:29:04,475
Speaker 2:  'cause I think normally he wears something more like a leather jacket. So

441
00:29:04,715 --> 00:29:08,595
Speaker 2:  I went into Google And I was like, when does ice tea lose the ponytail in

442
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:12,835
Speaker 2:  SVU? I got nothing useful.

443
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:17,035
Speaker 2:  And then I was like, okay, let me try the Reddit thing. Let me see if there's

444
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:20,435
Speaker 2:  a Reddit community that talks about it. All I found were Reddit's voting

445
00:29:20,455 --> 00:29:24,235
Speaker 2:  on whether they like bald ice tea or ponytail ice

446
00:29:24,255 --> 00:29:27,635
Speaker 2:  tea better. And I could see that there was like some who's winning,

447
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:32,515
Speaker 2:  it was pretty even. There were like people just who were

448
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:36,715
Speaker 2:  pro ponytail iced tea, pro bald iced tea. But

449
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:40,115
Speaker 2:  you know, I wasn't getting a, when does he he change his look thing? So I

450
00:29:40,115 --> 00:29:43,725
Speaker 2:  went to perplexity because, you know, I'm trying like, like you, I'm testing

451
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:47,725
Speaker 2:  all these things and perplexity calls itself an AI search engine first. And

452
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:51,925
Speaker 2:  it told me like the exact season And I was like, oh my God.

453
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:56,005
Speaker 2:  And there were like links saying the exact season. So I was like, oh, at

454
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:59,765
Speaker 2:  the end of season three, beginning in season four, that's when he changes

455
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:03,285
Speaker 2:  his look. That's early. It's very early considering there's 24

456
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:07,325
Speaker 2:  seasons of this show. But it, it gave

457
00:30:07,345 --> 00:30:11,165
Speaker 2:  me the answer of like exactly when that, that like, I'll, I'll,

458
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:15,185
Speaker 2:  I'm in season three now, so we'll, we'll see if at the end, at when

459
00:30:15,185 --> 00:30:18,985
Speaker 2:  we switch to season four, whether he becomes bald.

460
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:23,345
Speaker 2:  But it, it, it, it's a very silly example, but it's, it's kind of what you

461
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:24,505
Speaker 2:  were referring to.

462
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,185
Speaker 13:  No, I think that's so interesting and, And I think it really speaks to the

463
00:30:28,185 --> 00:30:31,745
Speaker 13:  fact that the types of searches you can do are changing

464
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:35,585
Speaker 13:  and, And I think that is the big thing to tap into, right? And so

465
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:40,345
Speaker 13:  I do think there are people who are maybe missing out as a result of,

466
00:30:40,565 --> 00:30:44,175
Speaker 13:  of being too skeptical that

467
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:48,335
Speaker 13:  AI can be useful. So I actually had another really interesting

468
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:51,935
Speaker 13:  chat BT use case literally just this past week.

469
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:57,045
Speaker 13:  Tell me about it. So I've been trying to get work done

470
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,285
Speaker 13:  in my apartment

471
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:03,965
Speaker 13:  and so I I, I have this big open room And I wanna kind of put up

472
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:07,725
Speaker 13:  a wall to, to turn it into a bedroom, right? Split it in half, it's a little

473
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:10,805
Speaker 13:  bedroom, little office. And so I started

474
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:14,485
Speaker 13:  thinking, okay, let's, let's just chat g PT for ideas.

475
00:31:15,905 --> 00:31:19,845
Speaker 13:  And honestly it was not very helpful, right? I I, I described the

476
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:23,685
Speaker 13:  project. It, it didn't really, you know, I think it's, it's

477
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:27,365
Speaker 13:  not great at like giving me image generation that, that is consistent,

478
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:31,265
Speaker 13:  coherent and makes sense. I already had pretty clear ideas on

479
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:35,145
Speaker 13:  my own of like where to put this wall. So like it wasn't

480
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:38,745
Speaker 13:  too complicated. So that didn't really help me. But one thing I

481
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:42,745
Speaker 13:  did was that you can keep going back to the same chat GBT

482
00:31:42,745 --> 00:31:46,625
Speaker 13:  thread over and over again. And so, you know, I've, I've been, this is something

483
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:50,505
Speaker 13:  I've been working on for like months at this point and you know,

484
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:53,425
Speaker 13:  every time I had an idea I would just go back to this thread and, and you

485
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:57,025
Speaker 13:  know, I don't have anybody to toss these ideas around with, right? Like,

486
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:59,945
Speaker 13:  I don't have like a professional I can, I can talk to because I need to

487
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:00,585
Speaker 13:  hire that person.

488
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:05,415
Speaker 13:  And so I, you know, I would like bounce things back And I, it would gimme

489
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:08,455
Speaker 13:  some, some ideas to think through. And anyway,

490
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:12,695
Speaker 13:  I finally got a contractor to work with me

491
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:17,455
Speaker 13:  about a week ago and the contractor sends over a,

492
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:21,735
Speaker 13:  a quote, right? And so I paste the quote into

493
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:25,295
Speaker 13:  chat GBT and it has like a breakdown of all the, all the work this person's

494
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,215
Speaker 13:  supposed to do for me. And I say, Hey, are there any questions I should

495
00:32:28,235 --> 00:32:32,215
Speaker 13:  ask about this? And Chachi BT goes, well

496
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:36,575
Speaker 13:  it doesn't list the closet that you wanted to add. And that was a mind

497
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:40,245
Speaker 13:  blowing moment for me because I had told chat bt months ago

498
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:44,325
Speaker 13:  that I needed to put up a wall to add a closet And I had told the contractor

499
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:48,125
Speaker 13:  this in person, but in their estimate they, they had forgotten

500
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:51,765
Speaker 13:  to include that. And it had noticed that

501
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:55,285
Speaker 13:  they didn't include it And I had missed it. I had missed that the closet

502
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:59,085
Speaker 13:  wasn't there. And you know, that's like pretty important, right? It is important

503
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:03,005
Speaker 13:  that we, we have in writing ahead of time the, the work that this

504
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:06,165
Speaker 13:  person is gonna be doing. And the fact that I had missed it, I, I thought

505
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:10,045
Speaker 13:  it was like, yeah, that, that really, really sent me for a trip.

506
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,765
Speaker 2:  That gets to another thing that I've been thinking about, like in my testing,

507
00:33:12,815 --> 00:33:16,765
Speaker 2:  which is like the best scenarios I found

508
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:20,605
Speaker 2:  for AI chatbots is just like

509
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:24,525
Speaker 2:  thinking of it as me talking to myself in the mirror, but the mirror version

510
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:28,445
Speaker 2:  of me has like a Google access. Yeah, yeah. And like a,

511
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:32,605
Speaker 2:  a running list of everything that I said I wanted. So like, I

512
00:33:32,605 --> 00:33:36,485
Speaker 2:  don't know if I believe all of the hype where these

513
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:39,685
Speaker 2:  big tech companies are like, AI is gonna be your companion. It's gonna be

514
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:43,485
Speaker 2:  what, like, I I find it more useful when I think of it as like I'm talking

515
00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:47,445
Speaker 2:  to myself because I don't have a sounding board And I need a

516
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:50,645
Speaker 2:  sounding board. And all the other people in my life who I would use as a

517
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:54,365
Speaker 2:  sounding board are one tired of hearing me talk about this

518
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:58,885
Speaker 2:  or too currently unavailable. So like, I

519
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:02,285
Speaker 2:  like you, I, I have these like different project things that I've been like

520
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:06,005
Speaker 2:  iterating on, brainstorming on where it's just like, ooh, I don't wanna

521
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:09,565
Speaker 2:  bother someone just yet 'cause I am going to take

522
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:12,885
Speaker 2:  something to someone and do a real in life meet person

523
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:17,045
Speaker 2:  hashing out of ideas. But I wanna go in prepared. I wanna like

524
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:21,245
Speaker 2:  have thought through the stuff already. I wanna know what questions

525
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:25,205
Speaker 2:  I should ask or like, have I missed something after like what I said

526
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:28,325
Speaker 2:  those things. And in that sense it's been pretty

527
00:34:28,905 --> 00:34:32,725
Speaker 2:  useful. Still not useful at times,

528
00:34:32,915 --> 00:34:36,685
Speaker 2:  like in the beginning, which gets to my other issue with AI is that you have

529
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:40,645
Speaker 2:  to do so much training for it to get to that like little nugget,

530
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:45,285
Speaker 2:  which is pretty labor intensive, but when it works you're just kind of like,

531
00:34:45,345 --> 00:34:46,885
Speaker 2:  ah, look at that, look

532
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,445
Speaker 13:  At that. No, that's such a good way to think about it. Like I, I I think

533
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:52,685
Speaker 13:  you're right and it's, it's funny, like I think people get very concerned,

534
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:57,005
Speaker 13:  rightfully so about like where this is taking away

535
00:34:57,005 --> 00:35:00,525
Speaker 13:  people's, people's jobs. And I think in these cases, like

536
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:04,685
Speaker 13:  it really is just talking to myself. It's, it in a lot of ways it's, it's

537
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,845
Speaker 13:  like talking to, yeah, it's, you're right. It's like talking to myself with

538
00:35:07,845 --> 00:35:10,205
Speaker 13:  Google who's just able to spit stuff back at me. Yeah.

539
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:14,445
Speaker 2:  I wish we talked about this kind of way to use AI more instead of like

540
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:18,325
Speaker 2:  the, I get why companies do the flashy marquee versions, but

541
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:22,005
Speaker 2:  this I feel like is more useful framing,

542
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:26,605
Speaker 13:  I will say there's a limit to this. There are also those stories of the

543
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:30,445
Speaker 13:  people who like go off the deep end and like, chat GBT

544
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:34,565
Speaker 13:  told me I can run through a wall. And you're like, no, no, no, no.

545
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:38,645
Speaker 13:  Yeah, no, no. Like, you still gotta still

546
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:42,245
Speaker 13:  have to like use all of your like, good judgment and instincts here

547
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:46,605
Speaker 13:  if you use it rationally. I think there are actually some like very

548
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:50,835
Speaker 13:  like simple ways it can kind of, you know,

549
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,795
Speaker 13:  just make you more productive or

550
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:58,835
Speaker 13:  able to think through things a little bit more clearly. It's not like I,

551
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:02,595
Speaker 13:  I would've not been able to accomplish these things without

552
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:06,795
Speaker 13:  ai, but you know, it, it was a lot easier and a lot more fun

553
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:10,755
Speaker 13:  than having to search through a million

554
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:15,675
Speaker 13:  forums on, you know, how walls are put up right

555
00:36:15,815 --> 00:36:19,515
Speaker 13:  now. It it, it's true. That does lead to the downsides, right? It, you know,

556
00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:23,155
Speaker 13:  we, we, we've been writing quite a bit about how Google

557
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:26,595
Speaker 13:  search traffic is declining And I think some of this is because of AI

558
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:30,995
Speaker 13:  and it's like, right, okay, so all these, you know, construction

559
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:34,875
Speaker 13:  forums that I probably would've read through, you know, are, are not getting

560
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:37,555
Speaker 13:  my traffic. And that absolutely leads to issues.

561
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:42,675
Speaker 13:  On the other hand, it, it's hard to argue that that

562
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:46,595
Speaker 13:  would've been a better experience for me than having a tool that can

563
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:47,795
Speaker 13:  just gimme a readout.

564
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:51,955
Speaker 2:  Totally. And you know, we'll see. Like, I don't think you

565
00:36:51,955 --> 00:36:55,235
Speaker 2:  can put it back in the box at this point. So you might as well figure out

566
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,445
Speaker 2:  how to make it work for you in some ways,

567
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:03,845
Speaker 2:  some ways like find the practical because it's getting

568
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:07,605
Speaker 2:  shoved down your throat whether you like it or not. At least

569
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:11,445
Speaker 2:  with search, it's helping with the fact that Google

570
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:13,005
Speaker 2:  is no longer what it used to be.

571
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:17,245
Speaker 13:  There is this idea forever that Google could not be toppled. Right? Right.

572
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:20,885
Speaker 13:  Nobody could build a better search engine than Google. And it's true.

573
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:24,405
Speaker 13:  I I think like nobody has built a better search engine than Google.

574
00:37:24,835 --> 00:37:28,685
Speaker 13:  However, it turns out that this other product is quite

575
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:32,525
Speaker 13:  competitive and it has challenges. It absolutely does.

576
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:36,565
Speaker 13:  But so does Google. And I think the, the key is

577
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:40,045
Speaker 13:  knowing what the difficulties are and knowing where you need to be careful

578
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,885
Speaker 13:  and apply your judgment in both cases.

579
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:46,175
Speaker 2:  That's so simple. But also the

580
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:49,855
Speaker 2:  rope, the applying, the applying your good judgment

581
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,695
Speaker 2:  I think is a thing that we're all so,

582
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:54,535
Speaker 13:  So much less fun if you just believe everything it says. Yeah.

583
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:58,655
Speaker 2:  So much less fun. And also like you can have good judgment or believe

584
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:02,535
Speaker 2:  you have good judgment and then find, oh, I got fooled, I gotta

585
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:07,015
Speaker 2:  practice a little bit more. But to your point, the good judgment

586
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:11,055
Speaker 2:  part is key. Well that was enlightening. Thank you so

587
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,615
Speaker 2:  much for, you know, talking with me about how you're

588
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:19,135
Speaker 2:  evolving your search process. Like I think that was like really helpful

589
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:23,295
Speaker 2:  to just chat that out and also made me realize that I also am

590
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:27,095
Speaker 2:  kind of going through that same process myself. But yeah,

591
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:28,375
Speaker 2:  thank you so much.

592
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,695
Speaker 13:  Yeah, no problem. Good to talk with you. Thanks for having me. Yeah,

593
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:34,535
Speaker 2:  Last up, Travis produces The Vergecast and he's

594
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:39,045
Speaker 2:  actually been vibe coding. We found someone who actually has vibe coded

595
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:43,205
Speaker 2:  using Google Gemini to help him with admin for tabletop

596
00:38:43,205 --> 00:38:43,925
Speaker 2:  role playing games.

597
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:48,405
Speaker 14:  I run an RPG online for some friends

598
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,885
Speaker 14:  over, what are we using now? I think we're using Discord

599
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:57,045
Speaker 14:  now. This is an original world. It is inspired by

600
00:38:57,115 --> 00:39:01,085
Speaker 14:  Pokemon. And so what the players are doing is

601
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:03,805
Speaker 14:  they are these trainers, they're going around and

602
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,845
Speaker 14:  capturing these creatures or finding other trainers

603
00:39:08,845 --> 00:39:12,645
Speaker 14:  who have their own creatures to battle against them. And this is

604
00:39:12,945 --> 00:39:16,925
Speaker 14:  an original rule set that I created. And one of the

605
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:20,805
Speaker 14:  things that I wanted this world to have was that

606
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:24,965
Speaker 14:  the creatures would essentially be randomized, like, I don't

607
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:28,325
Speaker 14:  know if procedurally generated is the right term for this, but

608
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:32,325
Speaker 14:  basically like I wrote a rule set of like, here's everything that a

609
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:35,685
Speaker 14:  creature could be like here are the moves that it potentially could have.

610
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:38,885
Speaker 14:  Like here's how many bonuses it can have at this level.

611
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:43,565
Speaker 14:  But I didn't want to like have a bunch of lists printed out where

612
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:47,405
Speaker 14:  I just like rolled, diced, like see on each table, like each thing that

613
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:51,165
Speaker 14:  the creature would be. So I fed the rule

614
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,405
Speaker 14:  set into Gemini and told it

615
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:59,045
Speaker 14:  what I wanted it to vibe code for me. And so

616
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:02,565
Speaker 14:  I will now share with you and our video

617
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:06,845
Speaker 14:  audience the app, And I will do my best to describe it

618
00:40:07,545 --> 00:40:10,565
Speaker 14:  for the audio audience here is

619
00:40:11,555 --> 00:40:15,375
Speaker 14:  the Crystal Spirits generator. Oh, these are called crystal spirits, which

620
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:19,215
Speaker 14:  I think also sounds like a Boone's farm style. Pretty wild. Okay, so

621
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:23,135
Speaker 14:  crystal spirits Generator. Generator at the top of the page it

622
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:26,775
Speaker 14:  lets you select number of spirits you wanna generate from one to four.

623
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:30,335
Speaker 14:  The level of the spirits that you're generating from one to six,

624
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:35,175
Speaker 14:  which biome they're going to be generated in this world has

625
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:38,055
Speaker 14:  color coded biomes according to the visible white spectrum.

626
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:43,135
Speaker 14:  So I'm going to generate, let's see, two spirits,

627
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:47,495
Speaker 14:  let level three in the, the blue biome

628
00:40:47,685 --> 00:40:50,295
Speaker 14:  Alright, would generate. And so we've got

629
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:54,975
Speaker 14:  it. It also automatically determines their initiative order for combat

630
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,255
Speaker 14:  as soon as they're generated

631
00:40:58,835 --> 00:41:02,815
Speaker 14:  and gives them a name randomized from a list of I think

632
00:41:02,815 --> 00:41:06,735
Speaker 14:  about 200 real animals and fictional creatures that

633
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:10,695
Speaker 14:  I also fed into Gemini. So we've got Octopus Crab

634
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:14,775
Speaker 14:  is the first creature that was generated. It is a water creature.

635
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:16,655
Speaker 2:  This is amazing.

636
00:41:16,845 --> 00:41:20,815
Speaker 14:  It's two xt, it's Combat Die is a D eight. It, it's a drag. It's time strike

637
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:24,215
Speaker 14:  is too. So it's interesting, like the way that you do this, it's like

638
00:41:25,145 --> 00:41:28,885
Speaker 14:  you ask Gemini for a cake and then it gives you a cake

639
00:41:29,025 --> 00:41:32,565
Speaker 14:  and then you taste the cake and you're like, can you make me another cake?

640
00:41:32,585 --> 00:41:36,565
Speaker 14:  But like, use less. It's just like you're getting all

641
00:41:36,565 --> 00:41:40,485
Speaker 14:  of these like fully formed cakes, right? Right. So each time it'll

642
00:41:40,485 --> 00:41:44,125
Speaker 14:  like create this thing and then, you know, you have to test it to make sure

643
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:47,165
Speaker 14:  that it's implemented the rules correctly and then you make a little tweak.

644
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:50,485
Speaker 14:  So, so yeah, this is what I've been doing with my time with Job And I

645
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:54,645
Speaker 2:  Oh my goodness. How long did this actually take you to make? Because

646
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:58,885
Speaker 2:  like, you know, I think we've heard the term vibe coding a bunch

647
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:03,165
Speaker 2:  recently in all of these, you know, developer conference

648
00:42:03,245 --> 00:42:07,045
Speaker 2:  keynotes. Did you have like the basics of

649
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:11,285
Speaker 2:  programming in your head? Like did did that help inform how

650
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:14,685
Speaker 2:  you were gonna do this? Or did you just go like, here are the rules,

651
00:42:15,105 --> 00:42:16,325
Speaker 2:  Gemini make a thing.

652
00:42:16,845 --> 00:42:20,445
Speaker 14:  I went, here are the rules. Gemini make a thing. Like, I know very, very

653
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:24,445
Speaker 14:  basic coding. It was something that I was actually really good at

654
00:42:24,465 --> 00:42:28,125
Speaker 14:  as a kid. And then my life, like, it was one of those moments where

655
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:31,445
Speaker 14:  two branching paths present to themselves And I went on the one that

656
00:42:32,265 --> 00:42:35,365
Speaker 14:  didn't make me an insanely rich engineer.

657
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:40,205
Speaker 14:  But yeah, so I mean like I'm, I'm really into

658
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:44,645
Speaker 14:  like tabletop games in general, like board games and like what is a,

659
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,965
Speaker 14:  what are, what is a, what are instructions to a board game other than like

660
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:52,045
Speaker 14:  a extremely simple set of like rules and code, right? So

661
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:56,045
Speaker 14:  it's not like too far of a stretch to take that and then give that to

662
00:42:56,265 --> 00:42:59,805
Speaker 14:  Gemini and ask it to create an interactive out of it.

663
00:43:00,465 --> 00:43:04,365
Speaker 14:  The, the parts that take a lot of time, like it, it

664
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:07,765
Speaker 14:  basically like what you're seeing here are like, there are a bunch of it,

665
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:11,685
Speaker 14:  it's a very simple looking app, but there are buttons that have like different

666
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:15,165
Speaker 14:  colors associated with them. Like I didn't ask it to do any of that. Like

667
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:19,045
Speaker 14:  it picked all the fonts, it like picked the emoji that it uses when it's

668
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:21,925
Speaker 14:  showing that something is like a water element. All of that stuff like Gemini

669
00:43:21,925 --> 00:43:25,725
Speaker 14:  came up with by itself. But the thing that

670
00:43:25,725 --> 00:43:29,645
Speaker 14:  does take time is like you experiment using it, you realize that

671
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:33,605
Speaker 14:  it misinterpreted a rule that you gave it, and then you have

672
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:37,565
Speaker 14:  to convince it that it's wrong. Because sometimes

673
00:43:37,565 --> 00:43:41,325
Speaker 14:  it'll be like, well I did that for you. And you're like, no, you did like,

674
00:43:41,325 --> 00:43:42,365
Speaker 14:  please try again.

675
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:46,485
Speaker 2:  Was it just something that you were like, Hmm, I don't wanna have all

676
00:43:46,485 --> 00:43:50,085
Speaker 2:  these sheets, let me see if AI can do the thing. Or was it something that

677
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:53,805
Speaker 2:  you found other game masters have been doing that you've heard of? Like,

678
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:57,885
Speaker 2:  is this a Travis original idea? Did you find it on Reddit? Like

679
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,765
Speaker 2:  what, what sparked this as like a reason to use ai?

680
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:06,205
Speaker 14:  So there are, there are a bunch of, of systems that work

681
00:44:06,305 --> 00:44:10,285
Speaker 14:  for existing like games. Like for example, Dungeons and

682
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:14,045
Speaker 14:  Dragons. There are plenty of places online that you, you can

683
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:18,085
Speaker 14:  go to and your, your character sheets are already in there. Like, you know,

684
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:21,685
Speaker 14:  the, the Dungeon Master, basically all they have to worry about is coming

685
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:25,485
Speaker 14:  up with whatever challenges the players are going to have to face next.

686
00:44:26,035 --> 00:44:29,925
Speaker 14:  Like all of the rules for the enemies are baked in, like

687
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:33,765
Speaker 14:  rolling the dice. That's all, all baked in because this is an original game

688
00:44:33,765 --> 00:44:37,725
Speaker 14:  system that I came up with And I don't know

689
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:41,405
Speaker 14:  how to code something like that. For me, I figured I would just

690
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:45,485
Speaker 14:  see if it worked and yeah, I think

691
00:44:45,485 --> 00:44:49,445
Speaker 14:  it worked a lot better than I expected it to.

692
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:53,765
Speaker 14:  I mean, in terms of ai, like I

693
00:44:53,765 --> 00:44:57,685
Speaker 14:  wouldn't want to use it to ask it. Like, Hey,

694
00:44:57,825 --> 00:45:01,565
Speaker 14:  so what should happen next in this story? I'm like, the entire

695
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:04,245
Speaker 14:  point of playing the game is that we are coming up with what happens next

696
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:08,085
Speaker 14:  in the story. So I wouldn't wanna use it for that, but I think

697
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:11,765
Speaker 14:  for sort of this admin use case,

698
00:45:12,905 --> 00:45:16,725
Speaker 14:  I'm, I'm pretty happy with it. It, it does something that would be

699
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:20,645
Speaker 14:  a lot more complicated for me to do on the

700
00:45:20,705 --> 00:45:24,365
Speaker 14:  fly. Like it would be possible, but I would just be like, hang on

701
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:27,845
Speaker 14:  everybody. And then I like, I gotta roll a D 100 right now.

702
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:32,525
Speaker 14:  Okay, the first part of the animal is fish. You know,

703
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:36,525
Speaker 14:  like, I could, I could do that, but instead I

704
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,365
Speaker 14:  basically wrote all of that down and then told Gemini like,

705
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,685
Speaker 14:  make a thing that does that for me. I

706
00:45:42,685 --> 00:45:46,205
Speaker 2:  Feel like you just ex described what I think,

707
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:50,165
Speaker 2:  you know, the real use case of AI should be, which is

708
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:54,125
Speaker 2:  taking the tedium out because to your point, I can

709
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:58,045
Speaker 2:  just imagine all the various dice that you have clattering on

710
00:45:58,045 --> 00:46:00,645
Speaker 2:  a table and then it falls off the table and then you're like, hang on guys,

711
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:04,085
Speaker 2:  I gotta figure this out. Oh, now I gotta find the dice. Oh, my cat is taking

712
00:46:04,085 --> 00:46:04,685
Speaker 2:  the Dyson

713
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:49,565
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back time for me to confess the very, very

714
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:53,205
Speaker 2:  silly thing that I have been using AI for. So

715
00:47:53,865 --> 00:47:57,565
Speaker 2:  to, to bring it back a bit, a couple of years ago,

716
00:47:58,605 --> 00:48:02,525
Speaker 2:  I kind of fell into the astrology rabbit hole on

717
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:06,365
Speaker 2:  TikTok. And I'm not talking about, oh, you just look in your weekly horoscope

718
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,885
Speaker 2:  and you look at your sun sign, I'm an Aries, and you go, oh, this is what's

719
00:48:09,885 --> 00:48:12,885
Speaker 2:  gonna happen for Aries. No, I got into the extremely

720
00:48:13,615 --> 00:48:17,525
Speaker 2:  nerdy version of this, which is natal birth charts. Oh

721
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:21,205
Speaker 2:  yeah, it takes your time of birth where you were born,

722
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:25,605
Speaker 2:  and depending on the status of the stars in the sky at that

723
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:29,365
Speaker 2:  point in time, you can apparently learn a lot about yourself and

724
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,165
Speaker 2:  what's gonna happen. And it's absolutely, it's

725
00:48:33,465 --> 00:48:36,945
Speaker 2:  absolutely crazy. I wanna preface this by saying that I don't really

726
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:40,785
Speaker 2:  believe in a lot of it, but there's been some batshit things happening over

727
00:48:40,845 --> 00:48:44,825
Speaker 2:  the last couple of years, and when you feel that there's no hope, I don't

728
00:48:44,825 --> 00:48:48,745
Speaker 2:  know, sometimes I feel a little better going and looking at my natal

729
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:49,585
Speaker 2:  chart and going, oh,

730
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:54,865
Speaker 2:  mercury is in retrograde and that's why everything is sucking

731
00:48:55,445 --> 00:48:58,705
Speaker 2:  yay. You know, and just going on with my life because

732
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:03,375
Speaker 2:  that I, I don't know, that's there. So at the start of this journey,

733
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:07,655
Speaker 2:  I was using the AP CoStar, you may have heard of it. It's an

734
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:11,695
Speaker 2:  AI powered astrology app and it's pretty well

735
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:15,455
Speaker 2:  known for being very sassy in its horoscopes, but

736
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,975
Speaker 2:  also very surface level. Like, if you wanna go deep

737
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:23,935
Speaker 2:  into stuff and kind of get some really nitty gritty

738
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:27,935
Speaker 2:  insights, which, you know, it starts off being fine just getting roasted

739
00:49:27,955 --> 00:49:31,815
Speaker 2:  by an AI saying like, girl, mercury

740
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:35,675
Speaker 2:  re me, mercury retrogrades happening. So get your shit

741
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:39,595
Speaker 2:  together, you sad sack. Like, you know, that kind of vibe of thing. You know,

742
00:49:39,595 --> 00:49:42,875
Speaker 2:  after a while you get really into something, you wanna learn more, you

743
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:47,325
Speaker 2:  want something more direction in your life because the chaos

744
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:51,445
Speaker 2:  of the world is getting really un unmanageable.

745
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:55,645
Speaker 2:  So, you know, CoStar wasn't cutting it for me And I was trying all these

746
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:59,405
Speaker 2:  different apps inputting my birth time. Nothing seemed to be

747
00:50:00,035 --> 00:50:03,805
Speaker 2:  answering the questions I had when I was in these

748
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:07,565
Speaker 2:  moments of like, dear God, I need, I need something to tell me

749
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:11,405
Speaker 2:  it's gonna be okay. So one day I was just on

750
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:14,685
Speaker 2:  the site astro seek.com, and then I scrolled down, I went, ah,

751
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:19,385
Speaker 2:  it has listed everything out so that you can copy

752
00:50:19,635 --> 00:50:23,305
Speaker 2:  paste the entire details of your birth chat into

753
00:50:24,975 --> 00:50:28,885
Speaker 2:  chat GPT, and then you can just have chat GPT, save your

754
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:32,845
Speaker 2:  birth chart as a memory and then you can ask it, whatever. So

755
00:50:32,845 --> 00:50:36,565
Speaker 2:  basically I have been asking chat GPT stuff like, you know,

756
00:50:36,845 --> 00:50:40,725
Speaker 2:  I am planning this project, what transits of planets

757
00:50:40,725 --> 00:50:44,605
Speaker 2:  in the sky support me being successful? When am I supposed to manifest

758
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:48,245
Speaker 2:  certain things? And like I said, I don't actually believe in all of this

759
00:50:48,525 --> 00:50:52,245
Speaker 2:  nonsense, but I am trying to make sense of a senseless

760
00:50:52,295 --> 00:50:56,085
Speaker 2:  world and I've actually found it kind of useful to,

761
00:50:56,925 --> 00:51:00,725
Speaker 2:  I don't know, just go to Chachi PT and ask my unhinged questions

762
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:04,645
Speaker 2:  when I'm feeling just a little out of my mind and

763
00:51:04,715 --> 00:51:08,165
Speaker 2:  just need to be like brought down to earth a little bit. And you know, at

764
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,125
Speaker 2:  least I'm not using Chad GPT as a therapist. I have a real person for that.

765
00:51:11,345 --> 00:51:15,325
Speaker 2:  But yeah, I go to it with a bunch of different timing and astrology questions

766
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:19,165
Speaker 2:  and go like, oh, thank you Chad. GPT. My Mercury is in the ninth house

767
00:51:19,305 --> 00:51:23,245
Speaker 2:  and in Aries. And that does mean I am a direct communicator, thank you.

768
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:26,325
Speaker 2:  Some very silly placebo type things.

769
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:31,205
Speaker 2:  I probably just confess to all of you that I am neurotic as hell And I amm

770
00:51:31,205 --> 00:51:34,805
Speaker 2:  using AI for a very, very silly purpose. But

771
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:39,285
Speaker 2:  hey, I've downloaded every AI powered

772
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:43,285
Speaker 2:  astrology app at some point during the past five years. Do I think

773
00:51:43,285 --> 00:51:47,245
Speaker 2:  this is a particularly healthy coping mechanism? No, absolutely

774
00:51:47,245 --> 00:51:51,165
Speaker 2:  not. But it is what it is and it's, I don't know, it's working for

775
00:51:51,165 --> 00:51:54,285
Speaker 2:  me. So that's what I've been using AI for.

776
00:51:55,255 --> 00:51:59,165
Speaker 2:  Don't at me that astrology is fake because I already know

777
00:51:59,705 --> 00:52:03,565
Speaker 2:  and agree with you. Just let me have this, Ms. Cleo isn't

778
00:52:03,565 --> 00:52:07,365
Speaker 2:  around anymore. Just let me have this. Okay, so that's it
