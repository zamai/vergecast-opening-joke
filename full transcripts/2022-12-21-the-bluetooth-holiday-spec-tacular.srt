00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,470
Speaker 3:  so hard. Let me tell you

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,110
Speaker 4:  So hard.

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,870
Speaker 3:  Whatever you think Bluetooth jeopardy is, when I say we're gonna play Bluetooth

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,710
Speaker 3:  jeopardy, it is so much harder than you think it's gonna be. You're gonna

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,790
Speaker 3:  watch a struggle through that.

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,030
Speaker 4:  We do. Great. We

23
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,630
Speaker 3:  Did. It was fun. We had a good time. Yeah, and then we're gonna

24
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,350
Speaker 3:  interview the former executive director of the Bluetooth

25
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,390
Speaker 3:  sig, Dr. Mike Foley. We tried to get the current director of the Bluetooth

26
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,630
Speaker 3:  sig. That's the standards body that oversees Bluetooth. It's the holidays,

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,270
Speaker 3:  so he couldn't do it. Mike Foley, the former director, he's the one who launched

28
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,870
Speaker 3:  Bluetooth 3.0. He oversaw Bluetooth. Man's a shark

29
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,510
Speaker 3:  key joined us. He had some very interesting things to say about the status

30
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,550
Speaker 3:  of Bluetooth, how political it is and where it might be going. I mean it

31
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,870
Speaker 3:  all in all, when you think of the holidays, you think of one hour

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,070
Speaker 3:  of extremely deep Bluetooth conversation. Alex, I don't know what you think

33
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,190
Speaker 3:  of.

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,070
Speaker 4:  That's all I think about. I wanna know the Codex.

35
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,910
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I think about Codex. The children are sleeping, the gifts are

36
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,670
Speaker 3:  wrapped. The little blue pairing lights are blinking. It's gonna be great.

37
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,230
Speaker 3:  Alex, what headset are you on right now?

38
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,630
Speaker 4:  I'm on my AirPods Pro, I think.

39
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,710
Speaker 3:  How's the Bluetooth?

40
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,830
Speaker 4:  You know, it's fine. It's not shutting off right now because I'm not leaving

41
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,630
Speaker 4:  my house. Every time I leave my house, it dies like just instant

42
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,030
Speaker 4:  shuts down, but I'm, I'm on the road to Texas

43
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,390
Speaker 4:  and it, it sounds, it sounds good enough.

44
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,590
Speaker 3:  I'm very happy to be with you in this moment, in this holiday season

45
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,270
Speaker 3:  and season of giving and love. When I think about how to

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,150
Speaker 3:  express my love for you and the Vergecast audience, it is

47
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,870
Speaker 3:  definitely one hour of talking about Bluetooth.

48
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,070
Speaker 4:  A hundred percent. It was actually on my Christmas wishlist this year

49
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,910
Speaker 3:  And get ready everyone. All right. Like I said, Bluetooth

50
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,750
Speaker 3:  jeopardy. It is so much harder than you think.

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,710
Speaker 4:  We brought it.

52
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,630
Speaker 3:  Get your minds in the holiday spirit. We're gonna take a break. We're gonna

53
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,910
Speaker 3:  come back. We're gonna play around with Bluetooth jeopardy

57
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,910

58
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,830
Speaker 5:  on an Airbnb right now. That might mean your extra guest room or maybe

59

Speaker 5:  expenses or maybe just a little something for yourself, your home

85
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,900

87

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,240
Speaker 3:  saying Jeopardy?

119

126
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,960

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,080
Speaker 7:  this data cable. Alex Kranz, I

135
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,000
Speaker 4:  Want you to know my strategy today is to just hit the buzzer as soon as

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,520
Speaker 4:  Sean starts asking the questions every time, but I think

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,200
Speaker 4:  maybe what is scuzzy?

138
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,360
Speaker 3:  Wow, I know that's wrong.

139
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,440
Speaker 7:  Wrong. Eli Patel.

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,600
Speaker 3:  What is the 2.5 millimeter headphone cable

141
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,480
Speaker 7:  Incorrect?

142
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,280
Speaker 3:  No. Well, I was worth the shot. If it's U usb, I'm gonna be so mad. Chris,

143
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,880
Speaker 3:  can you just try and see if it's u sb?

144
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,240
Speaker 8:  I'm gonna keep my lead here.

145
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,200
Speaker 7:  The correct response in this case is RS 2 32. Wow. I

146
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,640
Speaker 7:  would've also accepted cereal.

147
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,040
Speaker 8:  Definitely had the one right in the back pocket.

148
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,640
Speaker 4:  Scuzzy is like cereal.

149
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,280
Speaker 3:  No, it's

150
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,440

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,520
Speaker 3:  See I I knew it was something

311
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,560
Speaker 7:  Like that. Once again, Chris Welch had the last correct answer so let's continue

312
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:22,760
Speaker 7:  on.

313
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,760
Speaker 8:  Okay, let's see what happens when we do Pair me please for a

314
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,080
Speaker 8:  thousand.

315
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,720
Speaker 7:  This Bluetooth speaker with the most recent number one on our

316
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,400
Speaker 7:  best Bluetooth speaker list@theversion.com. This is claiming it

317
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,200
Speaker 7:  offers pristine, detailed sound quality with a surprising

318
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,080
Speaker 7:  amount of bass for its size. All at a rugged design you

319
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,880
Speaker 7:  could take anywhere. Chris Welch,

320
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,760
Speaker 8:  It's possible that I wrote this article possible.

321
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,280
Speaker 8:  What is the bows SoundLink Flex.

322
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,600
Speaker 7:  Unfortunately that is the correct answer.

323
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,680
Speaker 3:  Unfortunately

324
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,680
Speaker 4:  This was

325
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,920
Speaker 8:  Cheating. That's good. That's not very fair. Even I can acknowledge that.

326
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,920
Speaker 7:  Good. Let's keep the good times. Rolling. Chris Welch, your next category

327
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,280
Speaker 8:  Hack week for 600, please.

328
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,000
Speaker 7:  In 2004, Nokia and Sony Ericks had admitted some of their

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,920
Speaker 7:  handsets were vulnerable to this, a method of hacking into

330
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,440
Speaker 7:  a Bluetooth-enabled device and accessing personal information.

331
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,640
Speaker 7:  Alex Kranz,

332
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,240
Speaker 4:  What is Blue Nerfing

333
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,040
Speaker 7:  Correct?

334
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,080
Speaker 9:  Yes. Come

335
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,040
Speaker 3:  On man. It's the worst outcome

336
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,120
Speaker 7:  And be like do continuous. To slide into oblivion.

337
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,960
Speaker 3:  First of all, I would like some points for even knowing that Blue

338
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,520
Speaker 3:  Scarfing was a term and having that in my brain. I can't remember

339
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,040
Speaker 3:  people's names. I forgot my own child's name the other day and I'm hold it

340
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,920
Speaker 3:  on to blue scarfing. That's worth a thousand points. With

341
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,560
Speaker 7:  The last correct answer, we have Chris Welch with 1800 points,

342
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,000
Speaker 7:  Alex at negative 2,800 and negative 3,600.

343
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,840
Speaker 3:  I'm sorry. The moral victory of knowing that Blue scarfing was a real word

344
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,760
Speaker 3:  is very high and I'm currently the winner. I'm just putting that out there.

345
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,880
Speaker 4:  I want you to know, I did not know it was a real word. I thought you made

346
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,160
Speaker 4:  it up.

347
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,240
Speaker 3:  I can't believe I confused Blue Scarfing and Bluejack. That's a rookie Bluetooth

348
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,160
Speaker 3:  jeopardy mistake.

349
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,200
Speaker 7:  Crad, wanna continue this?

350
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I'm gonna do a RI for 1000.

351
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,040
Speaker 4:  That was my really good Sean Connery impression.

352
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Speaker 3:  That's good, thanks.

353
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,360
Speaker 7:  This year the Bluetooth standard organization thought this company

354
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,480
Speaker 7:  was trying to get a free ride by putting Bluetooth brand

355
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,440
Speaker 7:  in cars without paying requisite product declaration fees. Those

356
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,840
Speaker 7:  last five words are in air quotes. We're getting its cars certified.

357
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,880
Speaker 7:  Nelia Patel,

358
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,600
Speaker 3:  Who is Stelmanis or fca? It's one of, they're the same company.

359
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,160
Speaker 7:  Yes, it's

360
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,520
Speaker 3:  Correct, yes. I'm deeply aware of when Chrysler is doing dumb things.

361
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,800
Speaker 3:  My zone.

362
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,920
Speaker 7:  Nela, you're next.

363
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,760
Speaker 3:  Oh no, I can't. I can't. You can't follow the highs with the lows.

364
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,840
Speaker 3:  Let's go with spectacular for 600.

365
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,360
Speaker 7:  This subset of Bluetooth War 0.0 was previously known as

366
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,640
Speaker 7:  wiry, which was intended for such industries as fitness, security and home

367
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,720
Speaker 7:  entertainment. It later tried to track the novel Coronavirus

368
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,280
Speaker 3:  Wiry.

369
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,040
Speaker 7:  I will accept wiry as a pronunciation

370
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,280
Speaker 3:  And we know what wiry is.

371
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,240
Speaker 7:  You probably know what the answer to this one is.

372
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,880
Speaker 3:  I do because I can guess. I mean, just,

373
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,160
Speaker 7:  Just, just, just guess

374
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,960
Speaker 3:  What is Bluetooth? Ellie?

375
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,560
Speaker 7:  The correct answer is Bluetooth, low energy

376
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,720
Speaker 3:  There. Kick

377
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,520
Speaker 7:  Us off again.

378
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,200
Speaker 3:  Spectacular for 800.

379
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,000
Speaker 7:  These are sets of specifications or rules that determine how a Bluetooth

380
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,760
Speaker 7:  device is used, whether it's hand three has land access or even an

381
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,320
Speaker 7:  iPod accessory. Nii.

382
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,840
Speaker 3:  What are Bluetooth profiles?

383
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,720
Speaker 7:  Yes,

384
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,600
Speaker 3:  I knew this is my category.

385
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,880
Speaker 7:  And one more.

386
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,360
Speaker 3:  Now I want to stop.

387
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,160
Speaker 3:  Let's go with bluetooth.com for 200.

388
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,600
Speaker 7:  This is the standards organization and they've already buzzed in

389
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,720
Speaker 7:  the standards organization that oversees the development of Bluetooth standards

390
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,400
Speaker 7:  and licensing of the Bluetooth technologies and trademarks to manufacturers.

391
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,840
Speaker 7:  The answer. Chris Welch,

392
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,960
Speaker 8:  What is the Bluetooth sig?

393
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,160
Speaker 7:  Yes.

394
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,000
Speaker 4:  How did he

395
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
Speaker 8:  Know? Just got in ahead of Eli.

396
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,400
Speaker 7:  Next one, Chris.

397
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,880
Speaker 8:  Okay, let's do RI for 600

398
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,640
Speaker 7:  On the company's website. This speaker is listed to have

399
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,320
Speaker 7:  nine ways to listen to audio, none of which is pairing via

400
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,920
Speaker 7:  Bluetooth. Alex crayons.

401
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,560
Speaker 4:  What is the Sonos? Chris?

402
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,880
Speaker 4:  Nod or or or turn away.

403
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,160
Speaker 3:  Give gimme,

404
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,920
Speaker 4:  Gimme tips.

405
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,440
Speaker 7:  We're moving on. Anybody else? Wanna try the Eli Patel?

406
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,800
Speaker 3:  What is the HomePod mini

407
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,200
Speaker 7:  Dad might be true. The answer is the apple HomePod.

408
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,720
Speaker 8:  I think the judges can accept that. Yeah.

409
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,640
Speaker 7:  Next ne Eli, you're up again. I

410
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Speaker 3:  Gotta say the exhilaration of this run. It's too much.

411
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,760
Speaker 4:  You're almost into the

412
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,560
Speaker 3:  Positives. Pair me please for 400

413
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,480
Speaker 7:  And the answer. A daily double. Just kidding.

414
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,400
Speaker 7:  There's no round two.

415
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,640
Speaker 3:  Thank God.

416
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,120
Speaker 7:  In 2021, this device had a surprise upgrade

417
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,840
Speaker 7:  that added Bluetooth audio support four years after its initial

418
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,480
Speaker 7:  release. Chris Welch,

419
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,600
Speaker 8:  What is the Nintendo Switch?

420
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,760
Speaker 7:  That's correct, right pick again.

421
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,040
Speaker 8:  Let's just close out the bluetooth.com for a thousand.

422
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,040
Speaker 7:  And here's the clue. Recently it was announced Bluetooth would be

423
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,720
Speaker 7:  expanding into this frequency spectrum band and according to

424
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,520
Speaker 7:  bluetooth.com it will pay of the way for the next 20 years

425
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
Speaker 7:  of Bluetooth innovation.

426
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,760
Speaker 7:  And we're running out of time. Well

427
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,040
Speaker 4:  I'm trying to type faster into my phone to Google it but it's not working.

428
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,800
Speaker 3:  I was just like I can't cheat fast enough.

429
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,120
Speaker 7:  And the correct response response in this case is

430
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,800
Speaker 7:  the six gigahertz spectrum band.

431
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,240
Speaker 3:  I could have guessed

432
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,800
Speaker 7:  That. Also handy for certain forms of wifi. Next

433
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,960
Speaker 7:  let's go again with Chris.

434
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Speaker 8:  Let's do hack week for 203.

435
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,520
Speaker 7:  Former campaign aids to this elected official told

436
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,920
Speaker 7:  West Wing playbook. She does not use Bluetooth headsets for security reasons

437
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,200
Speaker 7:  and insists on using wired headphones instead. Eli,

438
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
Speaker 3:  Who's Kamala Harris?

439
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,920
Speaker 7:  That's correct.

440
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,040
Speaker 3:  This story is great.

441
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:17,720
Speaker 7:  Go again.

442
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,520
Speaker 3:  I'm so close to the positive. Let's go with hack week for 800.

443
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,000
Speaker 7:  Limited to class two Bluetooth radios. This form of Bluetooth attack

444
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,760
Speaker 7:  creates a backdoor for hackers, which could allow them to list it

445
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,000
Speaker 7:  on the phone conversations.

446
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,560
Speaker 4:  Give us a hint just like a

447
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,320
Speaker 7:  Little hint. I have a hint. It is not blue snrp.

448
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,600
Speaker 4:  Is it Jingly

449
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,760
Speaker 7:  Puff? Okay, we're out of time. It's blue. Bu

450
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,280
Speaker 3:  So far in this episode of Jeopardy, we've heard about Bluejack, blue snaring

451
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,440
Speaker 3:  and now blue bugging. There's

452
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,240
Speaker 4:  Nothing left in hack

453
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,320
Speaker 3:  Week. I was gonna say tooth spoofing with no G at the end.

454
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,080
Speaker 7:  I like it.

455
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,200
Speaker 3:  All right, we gotta knock down this Genesis category. Let's

456
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
Speaker 3:  go to Genesis for 200.

457
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,880
Speaker 7:  The king with a dental problem. United, Denmark, and

458
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,400
Speaker 7:  Norway in 9 58 ad Alex Kranz, who

459
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,560
Speaker 4:  Is Harold Bluetooth.

460
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,480
Speaker 7:  I will accept that it is King Harold Bluetooth goon.

461
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,240
Speaker 4:  That's misspelled. Someone misspelled this. His name is

462
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,600
Speaker 4:  Harold.

463
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,200
Speaker 7:  Go again.

464
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,720
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna do Genesis for 400 and hope Eli doesn't get it

465
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:20,920
Speaker 4:  right.

466
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,640
Speaker 7:  Intel Nokia and this industry leader met to plan

467
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,480
Speaker 7:  the standardization of Bluetooth in 1996. Chris

468
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,880
Speaker 7:  Welch.

469
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,560
Speaker 3:  What is Qualcomm?

470
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,560
Speaker 7:  No nela.

471
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,920
Speaker 3:  Who is Sony Erickson?

472
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,120
Speaker 7:  Erickson is the correct answer. Dammit. We'll give you the points.

473
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,080
Speaker 3:  Yes. Oh, I'm at zero. I'm done. No more answers from me. I

474
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,960
Speaker 3:  bought myself bags in negative territory. You're not bluejack this away

475
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Speaker 3:  from me. Pori for 400.

476
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,800
Speaker 7:  He said this about Bluetooth. There are quality issues. The bandwidth

477
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,520
Speaker 7:  isn't high enough and even if it does get there someday, people don't want

478
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,760
Speaker 7:  to recharge their headphones. Ni Eli.

479
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,800
Speaker 3:  Who is Steve Jobs?

480
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,120
Speaker 7:  Yes.

481
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,640
Speaker 3:  That's a classic Steve Jobs

482
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,560
Speaker 7:  Quote. As we go into our last two questions, we have Chris Welch, the lead

483
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,920
Speaker 7:  with 2000 ni Eli at 400 and Alex

484
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,040
Speaker 7:  at negative $3,000.

485
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,600
Speaker 4:  I can still bring this around.

486
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,360
Speaker 7:  That leaves our final question, Genesis for 600

487
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,360
Speaker 7:  and the answer is this was the first mobile

488
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,040
Speaker 7:  phone to include Bluetooth in 2001.

489
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,560
Speaker 3:  Somewhere Deiter Bone is crying that he can't be answering this question

490
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:29,880
Speaker 3:  right now

491
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,880
Speaker 7:  And nobody is buzzing in.

492
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,360
Speaker 3:  Can we say company?

493
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,920
Speaker 7:  You can say whatever you like. Whether you get the points or not. We'll depend

494
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,800
Speaker 7:  on how close it is. Eli,

495
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,600
Speaker 3:  What is the Nokia N 92.

496
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,480
Speaker 7:  Not even close. Anyone else?

497
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,880
Speaker 7:  3, 2, 1.

498
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,320
Speaker 7:  The answer is the Sony Erickson T 39.

499
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,440
Speaker 7:  I would've also accepted T 36.

500
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,240
Speaker 3:  Okay, I would like some points for saying brand name and letters and numbers.

501
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,840
Speaker 3:  You get that? I got the format of the answer correct.

502
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,200
Speaker 7:  Don't take his points away. He was in the

503
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,600
Speaker 1:  Positive.

504
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,720
Speaker 3:  I wasn't like, what is the HCC bacon? I was like, what are some letters

505
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:10,840
Speaker 3:  and

506
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,800
Speaker 7:  Numbers? Alright ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back with

507
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,680
Speaker 7:  final jeopardy.

508
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,600
Speaker 10:  This is David at The Verge and this is the Motorola hint. This is sort of

509
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,320
Speaker 10:  the smallest of the announcements that Motorola had today. It's a tiny

510
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,840
Speaker 10:  little Bluetooth headset. They don't want to call it a Bluetooth headset

511
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,880
Speaker 10:  cuz there's all sorts of stigmas with that, but it's a Bluetooth headset.

512
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,840
Speaker 10:  It's made to be super discreet and nice looking. It comes in this wood plus

513
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,240
Speaker 10:  a bunch of other materials that are designed to look really, really nice

514
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,480
Speaker 10:  in your ear. And on one level it's just a Bluetooth headset. You put it

515
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,200
Speaker 10:  in your ear, you make phone calls, you can do voice control on the phone

516
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,360
Speaker 10:  and there's all this cool Motorola assist in Motorola actions and stuff

517
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,240
Speaker 10:  that all work. But on the other hand, it's kind of extra special for a

518
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,160
Speaker 10:  Bluetooth headset for the one thing, it's time for another thing. It's super

519
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,280
Speaker 10:  sensitive so it's made to go in your ear just like this. And there's a sensor

520
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,240
Speaker 10:  on it that recognizes when it's in your ear and it'll automatically turn

521
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,240
Speaker 10:  on and connect and then as soon as you take it out, it'll disconnect. And

522
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,120
Speaker 10:  even if you're on a call, it'll route it straight back to your phone. So

523
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,560
Speaker 10:  it's made to be super simple and to basically be worn all day. But you can

524
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,520
Speaker 10:  have it come and go as you please. So it's $149. It's designed

525
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,600
Speaker 10:  to be used with the new Moto X and the Moto G, but it'll work with lots

526
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,200
Speaker 10:  of other phones too. There's some special stuff with the way that one x

527
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,280
Speaker 10:  works that makes it even better for voice actions. But the Moto hint is

528
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
Speaker 10:  designed as really, it's a wearable, it's not a Bluetooth headset though,

529
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,440
Speaker 10:  it's kind of a Bluetooth headset. So the hint is kind of a weird little

530
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,240
Speaker 10:  accessory. I'm not sure how many people are gonna get into it. I kind of

531
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,880
Speaker 10:  like it, but we'll see how it does when it comes out with the Mox. This

532
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,040
Speaker 10:  fall

533
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,520
Speaker 3:  2014.

534
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,320
Speaker 7:  Okay, we're back. This is our final jeopardy question.

535
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,160
Speaker 7:  The first version of Bluetooth used a modulation scheme

536
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,000
Speaker 7:  called this, which modulated carrier shifts between

537
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,200
Speaker 7:  two frequencies representing ones and zeros.

538
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,120
Speaker 7:  You have 30 seconds. Good luck.

539
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,240
Speaker 1:  I

540
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,720
Speaker 3:  Mean the police are coming because we're playing this music. I'm very,

541
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,120
Speaker 7:  All right, let's see what our contestants wrote. Chris, you're in the lead.

542
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,040
Speaker 7:  So let's begin. You have 2000 points. What was your

543
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,480
Speaker 7:  answer?

544
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,920
Speaker 8:  I have no answer, but I also wagered no money and I drew a

545
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,400
Speaker 8:  smiley face to,

546
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,080
Speaker 8:  to signal my victory.

547
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,640
Speaker 7:  Well played nek.

548
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,160
Speaker 3:  All right. I wagered $5,000 and I wrote

549
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,720
Speaker 3:  frequency shift pulsing.

550
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,400
Speaker 7:  Hmm

551
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,600
Speaker 3:  Huh

552
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:55,920
Speaker 8:  Interest.

553
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,040
Speaker 7:  That was not the answer. Let's see how much it's going to cost you. $5,000.

554
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,800
Speaker 7:  Okay,

555
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,400
Speaker 7:  Alex Cranz with negative 3000. What did you decide to dip your

556
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,080
Speaker 7:  pockets into?

557
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,800
Speaker 4:  So I put a billion dollars on the line

558
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,400
Speaker 4:  for binary baby shuffle.

559
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,840
Speaker 7:  Excellent, excellent. The correct answer was

560
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,000
Speaker 7:  gf, sk

561
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,320
Speaker 4:  I was close.

562
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,800
Speaker 7:  Gaussian frequency shift. Keach,

563
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,680
Speaker 3:  I got some words in there. Yes, that

564
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,080
Speaker 7:  Counts. I feel like some of your random words were, were among the right

565
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,960
Speaker 7:  words. Something

566
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,920
Speaker 8:  To do with the frequency.

567
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,320
Speaker 3:  You might use the word frequency and the word shift, which you

568
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,360
Speaker 3:  earned in the question.

569
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,360
Speaker 4:  He gets 2,500, give him 2,500. He earned it. Don't

570
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,000
Speaker 4:  put 'em in the

571
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,640
Speaker 7:  Negative. And the winner of today is Chris Welch with

572
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,440
Speaker 7:  2000 FTX tokens. Thank you. Her pledge.

573
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,520
Speaker 3:  Chris has won nothing. You know I would be in the lead if I'd

574
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,640
Speaker 3:  under, if I remembered the difference between Bluejack and Blueing. Yeah,

575
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,680
Speaker 3:  I just wanna put that out there.

576
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,280
Speaker 7:  We'll be right back with more of the Bluetooth holiday

577
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,240
Speaker 7:  spectacular.

578
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,150
Speaker 5:  Today's episode is sponsored by Airbnb. Airbnb lets you

579
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,790
Speaker 5:  book comfortable stays all around the world. So comfortable, they might even

580
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,670
Speaker 5:  feel like home, which might lead you to wonder could my place be an Airbnb?

581
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,590
Speaker 5:  And if it was, what could it earn? The exciting answer to that question

582
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,430
Speaker 5:  is that right now you could be sitting on an Airbnb and not even know it.

583
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,710
Speaker 5:  Maybe you have a spare room that's already a haven for visiting friends and

584
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,550
Speaker 5:  family. So why not make it an Airbnb and make some extra cash

585
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,470
Speaker 5:  instead of letting it sit empty. Some people Airbnb their entire homes

586
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,790
Speaker 5:  when they're away for holidays or a big trip. That's a great way to help

587
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,430
Speaker 5:  cover the plane tickets. Whether you could use a little extra money to stash

588
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,390
Speaker 5:  away for a rainy day or you're saving up for something fun, your home

589
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,470
Speaker 5:  might be worth more than you think. Find out how much at

Speaker 7:  earbuds that had pairing to multiple devices at once. That'd be great.

615
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,140
Speaker 3:  And Cranz is here. Hey

616

Speaker 4:  Cranz, I'm your friend who's pissed at Sean for his rude

617
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,740
Speaker 4:  scoring of me during Jeopardy.

618
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,220
Speaker 3:  Yeah, Sean, I don't know if you understand the point of this segment is revenge

619
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,660
Speaker 3:  taking, of course our inspiration from Bluetooth Notorious Pirate

620
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,380
Speaker 3:  who sought only revenge. I have not read anything about said pirate.

621
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,660
Speaker 3:  I just tease a pirate.

622
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,700
Speaker 7:  The Verge has been about a revenge for a very long time. It's, it's, it's

623
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,500
Speaker 7:  fitting that we bring it back for Christmas.

624
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,180
Speaker 3:  Sean and I are, we are, these are founders. We founded this whole site on

625
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,700
Speaker 3:  revenge. So this is all fitting. Okay, let's talk about Bluetooth in the

626
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,460
Speaker 3:  context of the holidays, Chris, it's, you cover the, the headphones space

627
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,020
Speaker 3:  pretty carefully. It seems like the moment for Bluetooth

628
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,060
Speaker 3:  right now is everyone has hit the bandwidth limits of Bluetooth as

629
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,940
Speaker 3:  we know it and they're doing stuff next to it. They're doing stuff

630
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,180
Speaker 3:  on top of it. What is going on here?

631
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,500
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean I think they're all trying to just kind of stand out with their

632
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,460
Speaker 8:  headphones quality. Samsung has their own Kodak. You've got Sony with

633
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,700
Speaker 8:  ldac, which is actually kind of spread between a bunch of headphones makers

634
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,860
Speaker 8:  and then there's, there's Qualcomm Snap track and sound, which might

635
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,700
Speaker 8:  be CD quality sometime soon. But you're gonna need new earbuds and who knows,

636
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,740
Speaker 8:  probably a new phone. I

637
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,100
Speaker 7:  Got pitches literally today.

638
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,460
Speaker 4:  We're not just CD quality yet.

639
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,140
Speaker 8:  I mean Sony's close-ish. Samsung says they can do

640
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,180
Speaker 8:  a 24 bit audio on the Buds two Pro, but like the actual bit rate is

641
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,500
Speaker 8:  unclear. So who knows what quality it actually is. It's all just a mess.

642
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,420
Speaker 8:  But like yeah, the idea is that they can say like these products are now

643
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,980
Speaker 8:  hi-fi or just sound better than they did before. So you upgrade and buy a

644
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,380
Speaker 8:  new set of headphones your buds or

645
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,540
Speaker 4:  They'll now work with title.

646
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,460
Speaker 8:  Yeah title but no Spotify hi-fi which was announced almost two years ago

647
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,500
Speaker 8:  and has yet to come to fruition.

648
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:27,540
Speaker 7:  So the protocol itself is like just a few megabits per second,

649
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,020
Speaker 7:  right? That's, that's all you can transmit between Bluetooth devices at a

650
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,180
Speaker 7:  time. And so that's the the hesitation here.

651
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,100
Speaker 8:  Yeah that and plus like the actual, so the file codex that's Apples used

652
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,360
Speaker 8:  the AAC codec forever. They felt no need to ever go beyond that

653
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:41,960
Speaker 8:  so far.

654
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,920
Speaker 3:  By the way, apple will claim that the actual Kodak they use between

655
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,880
Speaker 3:  the phone and AirPods is they're tweaking it all the time

656
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,640
Speaker 3:  and improving it all the time. This is what they claim. Is it stock AAC

657
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,280
Speaker 3:  or is Apple messing with it AC on the edges all the time to do

658
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,120
Speaker 3:  some proprietary AirPod stuff that no one else has access to?

659
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:05,440
Speaker 3:  We don't know. We can't verify what they're actually doing between their

660
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,400
Speaker 3:  own devices and their closed ecosystem. And this is what everyone else seems

661
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,360
Speaker 3:  to be doing right? Like you, you are stuck with a handful of codex that you

662
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,720
Speaker 3:  can license from Snapdragon or Sony or whatever, but you're stuck with some

663
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,560
Speaker 3:  basic limitations of Bluetooth and then you have to add

664
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,520
Speaker 3:  on to them or do something proprietary to add more features or

665
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,160
Speaker 3:  more sound quality. And that doesn't seem like the industry is settled on

666
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,240
Speaker 3:  standards. It seems like Samsung is basically like what wouldn't it be cool

667
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,400
Speaker 3:  if everyone bought Samsung headphones and they bought the Oxy phone?

668
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,480
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean when you have like seven different codex, there's just a lot

669
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,920
Speaker 8:  going on and I don't know how anybody really keeps it straight. Like someone

670
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,360
Speaker 8:  who just goes and buys a new pair of headphones from like Sennheiser or Bowers

671
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,320
Speaker 8:  and Wilkins, like they support stuff like Apex and like Apex HD and

672
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,080
Speaker 8:  Apex Lossless. Even that one standard has like four

673
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,960
Speaker 8:  tiers of different supporters. So it's gotten

674
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,840
Speaker 8:  a bit jumbled. I

675
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,000
Speaker 7:  Think part of this is that the standards aren't very good.

676
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,000
Speaker 7:  Like I j I just wrote about this with the steam deck. If you wanna set up

677
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,840
Speaker 7:  your Bluetooth earbuds and hear what you're doing on your game system, the

678
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,400
Speaker 7:  default is that it uses a profile that is not low

679
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,160
Speaker 7:  latency. It's supposed to be like high quality instead of low latency. And

680
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,680
Speaker 7:  so you have this tremendous lag and I swing a sword and I don't hear it till

681
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,560
Speaker 7:  almost entire second is passed. Where's my woosh? I wanna hear my woosh.

682
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,640
Speaker 7:  But they have to, they have to choose between the high quality of their low

683
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,200
Speaker 7:  latency. You don't get both automatically.

684
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,880
Speaker 8:  So it's Sony if you use the LDAC Kodak and you choose like the highest setting,

685
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,960
Speaker 8:  I think it's like nine, 960 like kilobits per second. It gets like really

686
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,640
Speaker 8:  unstable when it cuts out constantly. So even that like at its best quality

687
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,440
Speaker 8:  just doesn't work very well. So I think if there is like a next step to come

688
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,560
Speaker 8:  and it sounds like Qualcomm has new chips coming for phones that ends

689
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,760
Speaker 8:  some for headphones too. That'll like make things more stable and hopefully

690
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,120
Speaker 8:  keep that higher quality and actually so you can enjoy it, not just have

691
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,920
Speaker 8:  cutouts all the time.

692
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,960
Speaker 3:  So Apple uses a C, other people are using other proprietary code acts like

693
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,920
Speaker 3:  ldac and Snap Track and sound. Yeah, great name. But

694
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,720
Speaker 3:  it sounds like there's an actual Bluetooth audio Kodak

695
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,200
Speaker 3:  upgrade coming with lc three. It sounds like there's

696
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,720
Speaker 3:  functionality updates coming with or cast. What's going on there?

697
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,360
Speaker 8:  So I haven't really looked into AutoCast much. I think it's just gonna be

698
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,800
Speaker 8:  one of those things where you can compare with like multiple devices at once

699
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Speaker 8:  or like, like several phones can compare to one speaker. Things like that.

700
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,880
Speaker 7:  Theoretically I love this idea you're gonna be in your airport or your hospital

701
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,080
Speaker 7:  and you're listening to your music on your earbuds, but you've also apparently

702
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,040
Speaker 7:  opted in to connect to like the local acast access point.

703
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,440
Speaker 7:  And so you'll hear your airport at Outspent and instead of them trying to

704
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,240
Speaker 7:  like pump up the sound to a ridiculous level which blows at everybody's

705
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,920
Speaker 7:  ears just so they can get through the earbuds that you have on, it'll just

706
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,720
Speaker 7:  go directly there and hopefully also not blow out your ears

707
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,560
Speaker 4:  Like magic.

708
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,560
Speaker 3:  Yeah. They're gonna find a way to use that for advertising in in one second.

709
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,120
Speaker 3:  I'm just,

710
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,960
Speaker 3:  I just, I just know how this goes. Yeah that seems interesting, right? Like

711
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,920
Speaker 3:  everything is wireless, there are new seat back. I think United has new seat

712
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,680
Speaker 3:  backs entertainment units that have Bluetooth but the actual

713
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,560
Speaker 3:  like lc three Kodak functionality, it's not

714
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,320
Speaker 3:  out yet. When's that coming?

715
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,400
Speaker 8:  I think it's starting to rollout my latest version of Android supports it

716
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,440
Speaker 8:  and there's some earbuds that will get updates for it but it's not so much

717
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,000
Speaker 8:  about quality. Like it's about more efficiency and so it's not so much gonna

718
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,000
Speaker 8:  like change the game in terms of like you know, like lossless streaming or

719
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,480
Speaker 8:  any of that. It's just gonna be more efficient and should work better

720
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,880
Speaker 4:  So it'll approve battery life.

721
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,080
Speaker 8:  Yeah, stuff like that.

722
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,960
Speaker 3:  So Chris just like let's run down the list here. So Sony has l a,

723
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,920
Speaker 3:  it tops out at nine 90. You're saying it's unreliable. There's standard

724
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,880
Speaker 3:  Bluetooth SBC which tops out at 3 28.

725
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,880
Speaker 3:  The fact that we're only at CD quality and I get why people say CD quality

726
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,400
Speaker 3:  cuz once you get above it it's very hard for people to hear the difference.

727
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,320
Speaker 8:  Like right, I mean most people say that you can't even tell the difference

728
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,200
Speaker 8:  between like AAC and CD quality and that's what Apple said for years and

729
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,800
Speaker 8:  years and years until suddenly there was spatial audio and and

730
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,760
Speaker 8:  lossless on Apple Music.

731
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,040
Speaker 3:  But Apple stuff even over wireless, there's no lossless over any wireless

732
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,320
Speaker 3:  connection to an Apple product. Right? Right. And even on a phone they kind

733
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,880
Speaker 3:  of want you to plug in a different DAC to get lossless out of it. So just

734
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,400
Speaker 3:  compare and contrast these, these codex for me, like inside of

735
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,320
Speaker 3:  Bluetooth there's a bunch of ways to get audio out

736
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,840
Speaker 3:  and most of them are hitting a limit and then

737
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,560
Speaker 3:  there's the functionality stuff like or cast pair stuff to any TV you're

738
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,200
Speaker 3:  walking by simply there's Apples H one

739
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,040
Speaker 3:  and H two chips where they're, they're controlling the connection more

740
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,520
Speaker 3:  directly in a proprietary way than no one else has access to. There's fast

741
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,080
Speaker 3:  pair and Android. What's left of this standard? Like what's the point?

742
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,960
Speaker 8:  I think it's just a case where people just build on top of it and build on

743
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,760
Speaker 8:  top of it and build on top of it and CFR they can push it. I mean you've

744
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,240
Speaker 8:  also got like spatial audio and all that stuff that's on the AirPods coming

745
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,160
Speaker 8:  soon to the pixel buds pro that's already on Samsung earbuds. So let's just

746
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,160
Speaker 8:  like how can we build on top of just the core earbuds experience and keep

747
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,120
Speaker 8:  selling new pairs? Cuz if they sound great then that's not all that matters.

748
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,760
Speaker 8:  Obviously they want to like isn't

749
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,680
Speaker 4:  The core experience though kind of crummy Like I, I think

750
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Speaker 4:  we, we all make the sacrifice of using these earbuds because they're way

751
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,600
Speaker 4:  more convenient and also because everybody got rid of the port to plug

752
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,240
Speaker 4:  in regular ear earbuds but they're still kind of crummy. Like we were talking

753
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,760
Speaker 4:  about this before we started recording. Anytime I leave my house, if I touch

754
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,600
Speaker 4:  the door just right, it'll disconnect my

755
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,400
Speaker 4:  earbuds consistently. Right. And for

756
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,120
Speaker 4:  years like it has to actually send the audio signal to both

757
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,720
Speaker 4:  earbuds because it can't communicate through your body

758
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,360
Speaker 4:  because Bluetooth's like biggest problem is dealing with the fact that water

759
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,080
Speaker 4:  exists, right? Like it feels like we Bluetooth has a limit and everybody's

760
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,840
Speaker 4:  just like we're gonna keep piling on top of the garbage pile because we don't

761
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,480
Speaker 4:  have anything else.

762
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,040
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think it's gotten a bit better in that regard. Like I think most

763
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,960
Speaker 8:  of the recent earbuds and headphones I reviewed have much fewer cutout to

764
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,800
Speaker 8:  them. They used to like there are like parts of the city where I would walk

765
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,680
Speaker 8:  down and most stuff from like a few years ago would always drop out and constantly

766
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,880
Speaker 8:  cut out. But now it's gotten a lot better.

767
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,520
Speaker 4:  The Union square station was like an earbud killer

768
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,200
Speaker 4:  for years,

769
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,680
Speaker 8:  Right? That and like Bryant Park in a lot of areas,

770
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,920
Speaker 7:  I think it's one of the most intriguing things about the standard is that

771
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,800
Speaker 7:  you know, the one constant with every standard is that companies

772
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,560
Speaker 7:  love to rebrand it to sell you shit, to make it seem like you need

773
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,440
Speaker 7:  their proprietary shit to make things work. Even though it's actually a standard

774
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,200
Speaker 7:  like H D M I C C or USB versus

775
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,120
Speaker 7:  Thunderbolt. But here this is, this is a situation where

776
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,600
Speaker 7:  each of these companies is actually improving Bluetooth

777
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,360
Speaker 7:  in some way and it's a problem that the standard isn't

778
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,160
Speaker 7:  good enough that they are pulling it in all these different

779
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,400
Speaker 7:  proprietary directions.

780
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,560
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I don't think Apple ever says that AirPods or Bluetooth headphones,

781
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,120
Speaker 3:  I think they're over it, right? They're just AirPods, you connect 'em to

782
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,960
Speaker 3:  your iPhone and they work great and they pair to iCloud to your Mac and your

783
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,800
Speaker 3:  Apple TV and whatever else. You just see Samsung trying to run the same

784
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,840
Speaker 3:  playbook. You see Google trying to run the same playbook and underneath

785
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,320
Speaker 3:  it all is the sense that okay Bluetooth is a connectivity

786
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,440
Speaker 3:  protocol and we can just run whatever Codex and whatever control software

787
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,320
Speaker 3:  over that protocol to make the connection more stable. And I do not see

788
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:10,400
Speaker 3:  a ton of investment into making Bluetooth itself better for all the

789
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,040
Speaker 3:  devices in the ecosystem to play better together. The way that you honestly

790
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,840
Speaker 3:  see it with wifi, you actually do see it with h dmmi

791
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,920
Speaker 3:  like when we did the h dmmi spectaculars cuz of HDMI 2.1 and like

792
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,840
Speaker 3:  VR R came out and now all the TV support variable refresh and it all, I

793
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,400
Speaker 3:  would say it sort of works like it works more than it doesn't in a way that

794
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,280
Speaker 3:  Bluetooth, you know, the refrain is it'll be better next year. Then

795
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,160
Speaker 3:  there's all the other stuff Bluetooth is supposed to do, like run

796
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,880
Speaker 3:  your smart home and form Bluetooth le connections to pair wifi

797
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,880
Speaker 3:  devices to your phone and it's fine at that stuff. I think

798
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,720
Speaker 3:  in that, in those cases it's a utility, right? You bought a smart

799
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,320
Speaker 3:  plug you need to get it into home kit, you can just like wave your phone

800
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,360
Speaker 3:  at it and it'll like pick up a Bluetooth connection and pair your smart plug.

801
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,400
Speaker 3:  But that's neat. But I fundamentally like Bluetooth as a

802
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,480
Speaker 3:  protocol has now been shoved into like this thing that

803
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,280
Speaker 3:  headphone makers have to use that they would like to run away from as fast

804
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,360
Speaker 3:  as they can or they would like to hide as much as they can.

805
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,440
Speaker 7:  If you look back at the last 15 years of Bluetooth and, and I always think

806
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,320
Speaker 7:  back to like the Motorola, like HT eight 20 like

807
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,240
Speaker 7:  cinnamon bun stereo headphones that I bought my wife.

808
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,680
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Which were like the first Bluetooth stereo headphones and I think about

809
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,640
Speaker 7:  how shitty those were in so many ways.

810
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,000
Speaker 7:  Not like the pairing and the audio quality everything you had to do the

811
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,640
Speaker 7:  memorization of like like how many seconds do I hold down which button on

812
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,560
Speaker 7:  which side to make them pair properly? And like if I look at every like

813
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,360
Speaker 7:  five year span, I wanna say that audio quality and connectivity

814
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,800
Speaker 7:  and pairing have improved substantially from like one five year block to

815
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,080
Speaker 7:  the next.

816
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,040
Speaker 3:  Chris do you think audio quality is improved substantially from one five

817
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,080
Speaker 3:  of your block to the next? I think this is like the heart of what we're kind

818
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,920
Speaker 3:  of talking about here is yeah sort of

819
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,680
Speaker 8:  It's easy to fall down a well of like what matters most like the Kodak or

820
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,960
Speaker 8:  like the mastering of a song like Apple even has their own like custom mastering

821
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,520
Speaker 8:  of songs. They've got this whole program called Mastered for iTunes or not

822
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,680
Speaker 8:  iTunes anymore but Apple Music. And so they have like their own files of

823
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,560
Speaker 8:  songs that you don't get on Spotify from Amazon. So like is that what sounds

824
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,120
Speaker 8:  good or is it the Kodak or is it the he headphone tuning or what on the whole

825
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,320
Speaker 8:  I think they sound better than like five years ago. Like if you compare something

826
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,000
Speaker 8:  like the SONY thousand XM five versus the thousand XM three or

827
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,280
Speaker 8:  twos. Yeah there's been some improvements. I mean it's a slow incline. I

828
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,600
Speaker 4:  Mean I've got the the XM threes or the the noise

829
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,880
Speaker 4:  canceling ones to the 1000 XM threes.

830
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Speaker 4:  Is that what they were called?

831
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,200
Speaker 8:  Love the name. Yeah.

832
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,160
Speaker 4:  Would I really notice a difference not in the noise

833
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,960
Speaker 4:  canceling but in just like listening to music would I really notice a

834
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,000
Speaker 4:  a big difference on the

835
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,040
Speaker 8:  Fives? Depends how much of an audio person you are. I think that that's part

836
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,520
Speaker 8:  of it too. Like most people have like the first, well not most people, like

837
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,320
Speaker 8:  a lot of people still have it their first pair of AirPods and they love those

838
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,120
Speaker 3:  Spoken like a true audio person Chris.

839
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,200
Speaker 8:  Exactly.

840
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:02,480
Speaker 4:  I remember here being like it's CD quality, not yet. Yeah

841
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,200
Speaker 3:  And he's like yeah how smart are your ears? Crayons. Exactly. Really

842
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,480
Speaker 3:  saying

843
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,400
Speaker 4:  Very dumb.

844
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,120
Speaker 3:  I think there's that but it's also just you've got whatever the artist

845
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,480
Speaker 3:  made, you've got music, then you've gotta compress it to deliver it over

846
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,880
Speaker 3:  a streaming service because most of them are still not lossless. Then you've

847
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,200
Speaker 3:  gotta compress it again to send it to your headphones and then your headphones

848
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,920
Speaker 3:  have to do a bunch of work to like reproduce the sound. And that chain is

849
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,440
Speaker 3:  like, I agree with you. It's hard to isolate it Chris, but it's also this

850
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,960
Speaker 3:  is, this is the last thing Bluetooth is actually in charge of, right? Right.

851
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,080
Speaker 3:  Like I don't think most people want to use like Bluetooth

852
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,680
Speaker 3:  mice like right like any, like if you're a gamer, a Bluetooth

853
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,640
Speaker 3:  master's, I'm not gonna do it for you. Like they could not make this protocol

854
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:49,800
Speaker 3:  fast enough or reliable enough for that purpose. Right?

855
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,720
Speaker 3:  If I was like I'm gonna run my smart home on Bluetooth. Most vir cast listeners

856
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,600
Speaker 3:  know that as there's like a suicidal idea. Like you shouldn't just

857
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:56,960
Speaker 4:  Don't do that,

858
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,880
Speaker 3:  Right? Bluetooth in cars is whole like today,

859
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,720
Speaker 3:  like the dumbest thing, I was sitting downstairs, my wife got in our car

860
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,200
Speaker 3:  and drove away and my phone just paired to the car and the phone call I was

861
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,080
Speaker 3:  on transferred to the car, she drove away, right? It's still

862
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,960
Speaker 3:  just like dumb for that stuff in like hilarious ways. Google

863
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,600
Speaker 3:  Maps is still faking phone calls to send navigation guidance to

864
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,560
Speaker 3:  car stereos across the country because Bluetooth are like too stupid to

865
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,480
Speaker 3:  communicate well in all those scenarios. That's weird. So what

866
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,440
Speaker 3:  you're left with like the innovation appears to be in music and they are

867
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,320
Speaker 3:  just up against hard bit rate constraints that make it

868
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,200
Speaker 3:  impossible to do the next thing. And so you get, I

869
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,160
Speaker 3:  think Chris, you and I have laughed at this kind of like yo-yo from Apple

870
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,160
Speaker 3:  where last year they're like yep we're outta space and Bluetooth, wink wink,

871
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,800
Speaker 3:  we're do some Apple stuff and this year they're like, wait actually special

872
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,240
Speaker 3:  audio's a thing we might not need the room. Bluetooth is just fine because

873
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:58,160
Speaker 3:  I think they know if AirPods ditch Bluetooth, that's like a nuclear

874
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,080
Speaker 3:  move for them but people still need AirPods to connect to their Windows PCs

875
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,360
Speaker 3:  or whatever.

876
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,120
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So like what happens next year they have some kinda like custom code

877
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,720
Speaker 8:  decorator platform that they use like on top of Bluetooth or like beside

878
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,640
Speaker 8:  it I think like maybe last year that person spoke out of turn and then all

879
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,840
Speaker 8:  of a sudden this year there were rumors of the AirPods Pro two having some

880
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,080
Speaker 8:  new Kodak or like Lossless streaming that didn't happen. So now all of a

881
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,120
Speaker 8:  sudden they're like, yeah, you know what, Bluetooth works great, we love

882
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,000
Speaker 8:  it. Good, good times when the AirPods max two come along And

883
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,840
Speaker 8:  if those still use Play-Doh Bluetooth and aac, I'll be kind of

884
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,360
Speaker 8:  surprised cuz like two generations of $500 headphones that

885
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,040
Speaker 8:  still stick to this old very buggy standard that we've all talked about here

886
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,400
Speaker 8:  is not the best thing. So we'll see what happens I guess next year.

887
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,440
Speaker 3:  Happy holidays everyone. Bluetooth will be better next year.

888
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,640
Speaker 3:  We gotta take a break. We're right back with more of the Vergecast Bluetooth

889
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,600
Speaker 3:  holiday spectacular.

890
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,360
Speaker 12:  For 120 years Cadillac has been an industry leader in luxury

891
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,320
Speaker 12:  vehicles. Now they're redefining their future, starting with the all

892
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,600
Speaker 12:  electric lyrics. U v Cadillac's first ever electric vehicle isn't

893
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,160
Speaker 12:  a gasoline powered model with an electric system swapped in. It's something

894
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,880
Speaker 12:  completely different, built from the ground up to be truly original.

895
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,880
Speaker 12:  The Cadillac lyric pairs high performance luxury with the latest automotive

896
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,280
Speaker 12:  technology including available super crews. The first true

897
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,200
Speaker 12:  hands-free driver assistance technology of its kind. It comes with

898
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,160
Speaker 12:  an easy to use 33 inch diagonal advanced L E D screen and the

903
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,280
Speaker 12:  on a full charge. Actual lyric range will vary based on several factors

904
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,800
Speaker 12:  including temperature, terrain, battery, age loading, use and maintenance.

905

00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,390
Speaker 14:  My favorite story this year was the cut cover story

912
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,110
Speaker 14:  on Megan Markle by Allison p Davis. I have read

913
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:44,430
Speaker 14:  probably a zillion pieces about Megan Markle that hardly told me anything

914
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,390
Speaker 14:  I didn't know already. And Allison who's really I think one of the

915
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:52,310
Speaker 14:  best profilers writing profiles right now, just did a

916
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:56,030
Speaker 14:  really impressive job painting a picture of what it is actually like to

917
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:59,270
Speaker 14:  be her or even in her presence right now and how sort of

918
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,910
Speaker 14:  weirdly normal but also weirdly abnormal it is

919
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:07,350
Speaker 14:  to be her. And it was just one of those pieces that I wanted to put directly

920
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,350
Speaker 14:  into my veins. David Haskell editor-in-chief

Speaker 14:  the other day was saying how the magazine just feels so alive.

922
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:18,550
Speaker 14:  And that really is very true. As soon as we're bored of something, we

923
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,310
Speaker 14:  do something else and try something else and it's just

Speaker 3:  We're back. So we're onto our next segment of the Bluetooth holiday spectacular.

933
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,990
Speaker 3:  We're gonna interview Dr. Mike Foley, who was the CEO

934
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,670
Speaker 3:  and executive director of the Bluetooth sig with me on that.

935
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,590
Speaker 3:  Alex Kranz here. Hey Alex, is she here?

936
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,910
Speaker 3:  Oh, are you on the right microphones? No,

937
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,750
Speaker 3:  yeah, you're in your, you're you're using your car's mic and speakers right

938
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,790
Speaker 3:  now. That's what's happening.

939
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,990
Speaker 15:  I have no idea the switch. It's

940
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:27,790
Speaker 3:  Fine. The car sounds worse than ever. We're gonna definitely gonna talk

941
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:31,670
Speaker 3:  to Mike Foley about why the car sounds bad that's coming up. Chris

942
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:35,510
Speaker 3:  Welch is also here. Hey Chris. Hey. Hey Chris. Do me a favor.

943
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,710
Speaker 3:  In the spirit of the holidays, describe to people what the Bluetooth sig

944
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,470
Speaker 3:  is. So

945
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:42,710
Speaker 8:  The Bluetooth sig SIG stands for special Interest group is a collection of

946
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,390
Speaker 8:  all these companies from Microsoft, from Intel, from Apple that kind of like,

947
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:49,710
Speaker 8:  you know, guide the way and choose what goes where and what to focus on for

948
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:50,750
Speaker 8:  each version of Bluetooth spec.

949
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,750
Speaker 3:  I always think of the people that run these trade groups as being

950
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:58,750
Speaker 3:  politicians more than engineers. What should people be listening for

951
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,830
Speaker 3:  in our conversation with Dr.

952
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:04,270
Speaker 8:  Foley? Yeah, it does seem like a lot of politics and a lot of just, just

953
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:07,750
Speaker 8:  sitting down and talking and trying to just find some common balance between

954
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,510
Speaker 8:  like what the Bluetooth sig wants and what these companies want. Be it Samsung

955
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,230
Speaker 8:  or Apple or whoever to kind of build out features or include them in the

956
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,710
Speaker 8:  spec. Cause we talked about, you know, like Apple and Samsung having their

957
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,190
Speaker 8:  own kind of side things on top of Bluetooth. And so you'll hear kind of what

958
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:23,190
Speaker 8:  that tussle entails about like when companies wanna keep things for themselves

959
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,310
Speaker 8:  or just bring them over to the spec in general at wide. And so it's a pretty

960
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,160
Speaker 8:  interesting conversation. Mike's been gone for a while, but even back when

961
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,640
Speaker 8:  he was there you can hear that there was a lot of fascinating stuff going

962
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:31,880
Speaker 8:  on.

963
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah, and honestly the, the current director of the Bluetooth said couldn't

964
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,560
Speaker 3:  do it cuz it's the holidays. But I would say, I said this to Chris right

965
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,480
Speaker 3:  after this conversation that having the former person is actually

966
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,320
Speaker 3:  better cuz he was raw, he was not shy, he

967
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,440
Speaker 8:  Was very raw.

968
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,560
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So this is a great conversation again, truly

969
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,400
Speaker 3:  the the holiday spirit comes through in every moment of talking to Dr.

970
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,120
Speaker 3:  Mike Foley, former CEO and executive director of the Bluetooth

971
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,480
Speaker 3:  sig. Let's run that interview.

972
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:08,320
Speaker 3:  Dr. Michael Foley. You are the former executive director and

973
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,160
Speaker 3:  CEO of the Bluetooth sig. I'm currently the CEO and founder of

974
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,840
Speaker 3:  I Y S. Welcome to the holiday. Spectacular.

975
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,880
Speaker 16:  Well thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.

976
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:21,080
Speaker 3:  I can't tell you how excited I am to talk to you about Bluetooth in this

977
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,960
Speaker 3:  the holiday season. Let's start, you were at the SIG for

978
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:28,360
Speaker 3:  a a while. From 2004 to 2012, you let it,

979
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,560
Speaker 3:  you brought Bluetooth 3.0 to market. You let a

980
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,360
Speaker 3:  merger with another standards body called the library forum. Tell me,

981
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,240
Speaker 3:  in your role is the person who leads the standard, what's the

982
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,240
Speaker 3:  structure of your day? Do you wake up and say, I gotta take over the library

983
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,040
Speaker 3:  of people or they're gonna come get us? Do you do politics all day?

984
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,080
Speaker 3:  What is that tribe like?

985
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:52,200
Speaker 16:  It, it's interesting. I looked at kind of my role within the

986
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,160
Speaker 16:  SIG as kind of three prongs. One, I led the

987
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,840
Speaker 16:  organization, you know, we had a team at the time of about 60

988
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,680
Speaker 16:  people that worked for the Bluetooth sig. So I led that

989
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,600
Speaker 16:  group in that group, did the websites, did the tools

990
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,560
Speaker 16:  for Bluetooth, helped with members create the specifications

991
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,120
Speaker 16:  and publish them. So that in and of itself was a fairly

992
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,120
Speaker 16:  big role. And then kind of the second pillar

993
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,480
Speaker 16:  was evangelizing the technology and working with

994
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,440
Speaker 16:  member companies on having them

995
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,440
Speaker 16:  implement Bluetooth in their products. Cuz remember when I started

996
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,320
Speaker 16:  this, there were very few products that had Bluetooth in them.

997
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:38,760
Speaker 16:  So getting Bluetooth just into products and being kind of a real

998
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,680
Speaker 16:  technology was key at that point in time.

999
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,200
Speaker 16:  It's not like today we're 5 billion devices a year shipped with Bluetooth.

1000
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,080
Speaker 16:  I mean there was 50,000, a hundred thousand very small numbers at

1001
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,800
Speaker 16:  that time. So it was a different beast. And then the other

1002
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,080
Speaker 16:  one was more marketing and PR

1003
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,240
Speaker 16:  and analyst relations to promote the technology

1004
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:05,120
Speaker 16:  within the industry, but also to the consumer

1005
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,240
Speaker 16:  and try to convince them that the scenarios

1006
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,400
Speaker 16:  that Bluetooth was enabling was good for them, better for

1007
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,320
Speaker 16:  them. So that we'd create consumer demand to try to get companies to

1008
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,240
Speaker 16:  adopt the technology into them as well. So I kinda looked at it

1009
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,040
Speaker 16:  as three key areas.

1010
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,560
Speaker 3:  You led the Bluetooth sig in what you're describing as a pivotal

1011
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,520
Speaker 3:  moment. I would agree it was a pivotal moment. It's before phones were everywhere.

1012
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,400
Speaker 3:  It was certainly before wireless headphones were everywhere. We have a quote

1013
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,280
Speaker 3:  here from you in 2005 when you gave an interview and gadget where I

1014
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,960
Speaker 3:  used to work. The quote is probably next year to be able to stream music

1015
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,640
Speaker 3:  to your car stereo from your phone. I mean that's like incredible,

1016
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,440
Speaker 3:  right? We're far beyond that. But in that time, 2005,

1017
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,120
Speaker 3:  2006, it wasn't clear that Bluetooth was gonna win, right? There was like

1018
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,880
Speaker 3:  a competitive dynamic between Bluetooth, other wireless standards with

1019
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,520
Speaker 3:  wifi for a while, which I thought was always very fascinating. And then now

1020
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:03,880
Speaker 3:  with other things like thread and matter, there was a moment when Bluetooth

1021
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,680
Speaker 3:  was competitive for like smart home networking. How did you think about where

1022
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,440
Speaker 3:  Bluetooth was in the market in 2005 and where do you think it is now?

1023
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:15,520
Speaker 16:  Well, you're right, it's hard to believe back then. But there

1024
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,440
Speaker 16:  was a real question whether Bluetooth would ever be adopted

1025
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,360
Speaker 16:  or used in products. And that was highlighted by

1026
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:27,160
Speaker 16:  I, I worked for Microsoft before I joined the Bluetooth

1027
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,240
Speaker 16:  sig. And one of the first things I did was an analyst

1028
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,120
Speaker 16:  who were to get some feedback on where analysts thought the technology and

1029
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,000
Speaker 16:  try to convince them where it was going was a good idea and the like.

1030
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,000
Speaker 16:  And the first call I had with an analyst, his first

1031
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,080
Speaker 16:  question was, you know, how stupid are you? You le left a great

1032
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,960
Speaker 16:  job at Microsoft to run this technology that will be dead in a

1033
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,920
Speaker 16:  year. You know? And so that that made me think a little

1034
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,640
Speaker 16:  bit, well may maybe I'm not that smart, you know, maybe this wasn't such

1035
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,000
Speaker 16:  a good idea, but the scenarios that Bluetooth

1036
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,960
Speaker 16:  was enabling I thought were compelling and so

1037
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,840
Speaker 16:  did many other people. So convincing, you know, companies

1038
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,560
Speaker 16:  to adopt those and things was very important. And

1039
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,400
Speaker 16:  Bluetooth had, you know, some technical features, some other

1040
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,760
Speaker 16:  features that made it appealing for those scenarios and

1041
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:24,280
Speaker 16:  better than the other technologies for the initial

1042
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,720
Speaker 16:  scenarios that Bluetooth was used. You mentioned wifi and

1043
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:32,560
Speaker 16:  WiFi's, you know, at the time. Excellent and still excellent

1044
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,920
Speaker 16:  networking technology and it's used for other things now as well.

1045
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:40,120
Speaker 16:  But you know, home routers and laptops, networking was

1046
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,280
Speaker 16:  its killer scenario, if you will. And at least at

1047
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:48,160
Speaker 16:  the time, the 2004 56 timeframe,

1048
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:52,080
Speaker 16:  it really wasn't appropriate for, you know, the

1049
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:56,080
Speaker 16:  earpiece, the headset that you mentioned purely because

1050
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,720
Speaker 16:  of power requirements, latency as well, but

1051
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,120
Speaker 16:  primarily power and and cost. And so Bluetooth really

1052
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,000
Speaker 16:  was a good technology for those initial scenarios.

1053
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,800
Speaker 16:  And then of course we were able to keep adapting it and

1054
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,640
Speaker 16:  tweaking it for other use cases. And now today,

1055
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,760
Speaker 16:  which this kind of second wave of scenarios really started

1056
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,960
Speaker 16:  with Bluetooth four, Bluetooth low energy,

1057
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,080
Speaker 16:  which was the last speck that came out while I was

1058
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,760
Speaker 16:  running the organization. And that's really enabled Bluetooth to go

1059
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:34,200
Speaker 16:  into the health and fitness devices, the sensors

1060
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:38,200
Speaker 16:  that are just all sorts of new devices that

1061
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,560
Speaker 16:  really, even in the 2004, 2005

1062
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,400
Speaker 16:  timeframe, even Bluetooth wasn't properly suited for

1063
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,240
Speaker 16:  at that point because it wasn't low enough energy for these sensor type

1064
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,200
Speaker 16:  devices So, you know, once we got a foothold into the market, we were

1065
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,160
Speaker 16:  able to expand and improve the technology for more

1066
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,040
Speaker 16:  and more use cases.

1067
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:02,560
Speaker 3:  Tell me what that sales pitch was like, you go into Apple or

1068
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,320
Speaker 3:  Samsung or Dell or whatever, they're evaluating

1069
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,080
Speaker 3:  their range of standards to support. Do you have like a PowerPoint deck

1070
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,520
Speaker 3:  where there, do you do bribes under the table? What does that sales job look

1071
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,840
Speaker 3:  like? You take 'em golfing.

1072
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,480
Speaker 16:  I did that, yes,

1073
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,680
Speaker 16:  because I'm a golfer as as well. So it, there were

1074
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,560
Speaker 16:  some rounds of golf involved, but more times you would, you'd

1075
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,440
Speaker 16:  go meet with companies and yes, you'd have a PowerPoint

1076
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,880
Speaker 16:  deck that you would present. You know, the, the numbers, the

1077
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,680
Speaker 16:  faxes, you saw 'em and lots of conversations with them

1078
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,200
Speaker 16:  and gonna typically one meeting and one, you know,

1079
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,920
Speaker 16:  PowerPoint deck wouldn't be enough to, to close the deal. So

1080
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,840
Speaker 16:  there was a journey and they developed relationships and friendships

1081
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:52,800
Speaker 16:  with these, you know, people that are building the products

1082
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,440
Speaker 16:  and go from there. One meeting that stands out vividly

1083
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:00,400
Speaker 16:  with that was as going into Sony and trying

1084
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,080
Speaker 16:  to convince their TV team to use Bluetooth for

1085
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:08,120
Speaker 16:  your remote control, you know, the, at that time they were

1086
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,440
Speaker 16:  mainly IR based, but Sony was

1087
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:15,400
Speaker 16:  promoter or a proponent of using a different

1088
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:19,520
Speaker 16:  RF technology for the remote control. So it's a,

1089
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,560
Speaker 16:  it wasn't a very easy sell or, or meeting and stuff, but you,

1090
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,520
Speaker 16:  you start that way and go from there. And now Bluetooth is

1091
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,000
Speaker 16:  used in the vast majority of TV remote

1092
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,520
Speaker 16:  controls. You know, it didn't happen overnight but over time and

1093
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,960
Speaker 16:  continuing and you know, they told me the couple of things that were really

1094
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,360
Speaker 16:  needed and the spec before they could use 'em in a TV remote. So then you

1095
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,080
Speaker 16:  fix the spec to address those issues then

1096
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,040
Speaker 16:  you know, eventually it gets used there

1097
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,400
Speaker 3:  All. If you're gonna talk about Sony and Bluetooth, I gotta throw to Chris

1098
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,120
Speaker 3:  here so we can talk about some Codex stuff. Chris.

1099
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:57,160
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I guess, I mean I guess you were kind of gone before they

1100
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,680
Speaker 8:  came out with ldac and the whole spec to raise the bit rates,

1101
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,480
Speaker 8:  but I guess like what part of that did you play? Did you see it coming and

1102
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,720
Speaker 8:  like how do you feel now about like where things are headed? You've got Samsung,

1103
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,320
Speaker 8:  their earbuds do like 24 bit audio now. Like what's the ceiling for what

1104
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,400
Speaker 8:  is possible with the Bluetooth audio in your mind?

1105
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,720
Speaker 16:  Oh, I mean I pretty much the audio is migrating

1106
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,640
Speaker 16:  towards being run over the low energy channel rather than

1107
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,480
Speaker 16:  the, you know, a traditional Bluetooth channel and a couple

1108
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:29,440
Speaker 16:  of, I think really exciting things where the specs

1109
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,240
Speaker 16:  were just updated for that one running over low audio

1110
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,960
Speaker 16:  to be able to broadcast a, a stereo stream to

1111
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,080
Speaker 16:  multiple headphones. I think, you know, for sharing music between people

1112
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:45,160
Speaker 16:  or you know, in a a bar type environment where they have

1113
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,600
Speaker 16:  three games on, you can put your headphone onto whichever

1114
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,240
Speaker 16:  games you know you wanna listen to do hear that

1115
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,840
Speaker 16:  audio stream. And so I think there's a lot of cool things

1116
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,560
Speaker 16:  where, you know, Bluetooth audio is going to and

1117
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,520
Speaker 16:  being able to have though a basic functionality

1118
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,320
Speaker 16:  that allows interoperability between products from different

1119
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,320
Speaker 16:  manufacturers but then also enable manufacturers if

1120
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:15,240
Speaker 16:  they wanna put improvements on top of that. Whether, you know it's a

1121
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,480
Speaker 16:  different Kodak or different bit rates, things like that to

1122
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:21,960
Speaker 16:  enable, you know, their own products or products with their

1123
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,880
Speaker 16:  partners to work better. I think that's a positive, you know, that

1124
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,520
Speaker 16:  you keep the interoperability so you can use products from different

1125
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,400
Speaker 16:  manufacturers but manufacturers are able to innovate on top

1126
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,360
Speaker 16:  of that as well and add their own, you know, special sauce if you will

1127
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:41,440
Speaker 16:  to make what they believe even improve products. And I, I,

1128
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,840
Speaker 16:  I think that's great. I think the technology should enable that.

1129
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,520
Speaker 3:  Wait, is that the political answer or is do you believe that because I don't,

1130
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:52,000
Speaker 3:  I just to be clear, I do not like that. Is

1131
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,120
Speaker 3:  Microsoft doing embrace Xtend extinguish, right where Apple uses,

1132
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,040
Speaker 3:  I'm just pick on Apple cuz everybody knows AirPods, but I know Samsung wants

1133
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,240
Speaker 3:  to use this and I know Google wants to do this. Apple gets used AirPods,

1134
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,040
Speaker 3:  they leverage Bluetooth, this spec, they build proprietary extensions

1135
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,640
Speaker 3:  that no one else can access. Eventually everyone loves AirPods and then they

1136
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,120
Speaker 3:  leave the spec behind and they leave everyone else high and dry. And I can

1137
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,960
Speaker 3:  pick on Apple, but Microsoft invented this playbook, it was called

1138
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,480
Speaker 3:  Embrace extended extinguish with the web. Do you believe that that

1139
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,440
Speaker 3:  outcome can be managed by the Bluetooth SIG or you can avoid it or

1140
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,480
Speaker 3:  is that just the dynamic of the tech industry?

1141
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:30,760
Speaker 16:  Well I, you know, when I was involved with the

1142
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,880
Speaker 16:  SIG you would see some of that and a lot of

1143
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:39,000
Speaker 16:  the initial innovation was done that way and then it would be

1144
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,560
Speaker 16:  rolled back into the specification and now, you know,

1145
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,120
Speaker 16:  I can't speak for Apple with what they've done with some of their products

1146
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,560
Speaker 16:  and stuff if they'd ever want to roll that back into the spec.

1147
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,480
Speaker 16:  But back in my day when I was there, things like

1148
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,200
Speaker 16:  usability to make, you know, one of the early issues with

1149
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,080
Speaker 16:  Bluetooth was nobody could figure out how to pair devices and, and

1150
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,080
Speaker 16:  get them to work together

1151
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:05,480
Speaker 3:  And let tell you that's not an early issue.

1152
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:11,240
Speaker 16:  Yeah, fair enough. But it is better now Yeah,

1153
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:15,160
Speaker 16:  than it was then. And there was a, a major push in

1154
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,960
Speaker 16:  a whole spec, you know, it's Hallmark feature was secure

1155
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,320
Speaker 16:  simple pairing, which made pairing easier and that

1156
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,720
Speaker 16:  introduced a lot of the ways you pair today with it just works and things

1157
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,120
Speaker 16:  like that. And a lot of

1158
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:34,160
Speaker 16:  that spec came from companies that, you know,

1159
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,600
Speaker 16:  had already been working to improve the pairing

1160
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,360
Speaker 16:  experience because, you know, they, they saw the flaws in it

1161
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,120
Speaker 16:  at, at the time and those were rolled back into the spec.

1162
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,880
Speaker 16:  Now some of the things that have done since then to enhance pairing

1163
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:53,200
Speaker 16:  hasn't been rolled back into the spec yet. Whether that ever will or

1164
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,120
Speaker 16:  not, you know, I'm, I'm not close enough to the Bluetooth organization now

1165
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,880
Speaker 16:  to know if there's an appetite for members to do that or not,

1166
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,840
Speaker 16:  but I think it can work and I don't believe that all

1167
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,720
Speaker 16:  companies when they're extending a spec or improving upon

1168
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,400
Speaker 16:  it, you know, are are trying to, to wipe out the

1169
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,360
Speaker 16:  competition. Sure they're trying to win and have the best products out there.

1170
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:20,480
Speaker 16:  If the spec is so complete, if

1171
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,120
Speaker 16:  you will, then it doesn't allow for that innovation. And that was something

1172
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:28,080
Speaker 16:  we discussed a lot with each spec is where you

1173
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,840
Speaker 16:  draw that line, you know, how much is in the spec and

1174
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,760
Speaker 16:  how much is company Inno company's innovation on top of that. And

1175
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,680
Speaker 16:  that was debated, you know, with with every spec all the

1176
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,200
Speaker 16:  time. And again, I'm not in those meetings today,

1177
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:47,200
Speaker 16:  but I would assume that is still a major conversation piece

1178
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,640
Speaker 16:  is how much you put in the spec and how much you lead for company innovation.

1179
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:55,080
Speaker 4:  Can you kind of walk us through how you have those conversations where you

1180
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:55,960
Speaker 4:  wanna roll it back?

1181
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:59,880
Speaker 16:  Well that, that's may sound like an absurd thing

1182
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,320
Speaker 16:  to do, but maybe I was just shameless, I would do that all the time

1183
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,520
Speaker 4:  And it worked. That's awesome.

1184
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,080
Speaker 16:  That didn't bother me at all. Well sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.

1185
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:15,000
Speaker 16:  But you know, what's the old saying, the worst they can do is say no,

1186
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:19,480
Speaker 16:  you know, and, and I'm no worse off than I was before

1187
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:23,760
Speaker 16:  having the conversation or or asking. And

1188
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:28,240
Speaker 16:  a, a lot of times also though, you would go and speak not

1189
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,160
Speaker 16:  only to Apple but also companies that were building

1190
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,080
Speaker 16:  the products to work with the Apple products because

1191
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,040
Speaker 16:  they would be more motivated to want that stuff standardized. So

1192
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,960
Speaker 16:  those features could also work with Android phones or you

1193
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,800
Speaker 16:  know, o other products depending on what they were making and

1194
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:52,160
Speaker 16:  they, you know, would then have those conversations with Apple as well

1195
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,800
Speaker 16:  that, you know, we had re really like to see this feature, that

1196
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,680
Speaker 16:  feature rolled into the standard and you know, obviously

1197
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,520
Speaker 16:  those companies would have a lot of pull as well.

1198
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:06,520
Speaker 4:  So when you have companies like Apple who are pretty vertically integrated

1199
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,840
Speaker 4:  now and they make the iPhones, they make the AirPods and everything else

1200
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:13,920
Speaker 4:  that kind of disincentivizes them from like working with

1201
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,840
Speaker 4:  the standard more closely because yeah, they can just say, say go kick rocks

1202
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:18,320
Speaker 4:  Jabra.

1203
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:22,440
Speaker 16:  Well yeah, any company that's in that situation and

1204
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,800
Speaker 16:  you know, the Samsung of the world, you know, there, there's a lot of

1205
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,560
Speaker 16:  companies that are in that position. So you're using Apple as an

1206
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,000
Speaker 16:  example. I'm not trying to pick on them, I don't think what you're saying

1207
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,680
Speaker 16:  is very true, but there's also the chip

1208
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:41,480
Speaker 16:  manufacturer, you know, the, the Qualcomms of the world

1209
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:45,440
Speaker 16:  that want to be able to create their silicon and

1210
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,840
Speaker 16:  have it work in products to all their customers, not just

1211
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,880
Speaker 16:  Apple or Samsung or, or whomever and not have to do

1212
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,720
Speaker 16:  special, you know, spins for the one company. Obviously,

1213
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:01,040
Speaker 16:  you know, a company like Apple or Samsung, they will, you know,

1214
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,560
Speaker 16:  but, but they'd prefer to be able to have that be as

1215
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,960
Speaker 16:  versatile as possible. So even when a company

1216
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:12,600
Speaker 16:  has their complete vertical solution, I forget exactly how

1217
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,160
Speaker 16:  you phrased it, but you know, creates their own ecosystem, there's still

1218
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,080
Speaker 16:  different layers in it, as I said, like the chip manufacturers and other

1219
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:24,040
Speaker 16:  people that are motivated to standardize some of this

1220
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,080
Speaker 16:  stuff as well.

1221
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:28,240
Speaker 3:  When you talked about stuff being in the standard and some stuff being built

1222
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,920
Speaker 3:  on top of it and there's always a debate about where the line is, who's in

1223
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,360
Speaker 3:  that debate, who go, who gets to be in those rooms. Are you all around a

1224
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,240
Speaker 3:  whiteboard drawing lines at different heights and like angrily pointing

1225
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,840
Speaker 3:  at them, like who's in the room and what does that debate actually sound

1226
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:45,680
Speaker 16:  Like? So the Bluetooth specifications are

1227
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:49,640
Speaker 16:  created by members and there's work groups

1228
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,040
Speaker 16:  where various members that are interested in that

1229
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,200
Speaker 16:  use case or that spec would participate in.

1230
01:06:57,090 --> 01:07:00,800
Speaker 16:  So there's the radio work group work group

1231
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,720
Speaker 16:  for hands free in the car work group, you know, for the low

1232
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,600
Speaker 16:  energy audio just e everything that comes out of Bluetooth. There's a

1233
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,760
Speaker 16:  work group involved and member companies that have

1234
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,960
Speaker 16:  expertise in opinion for lack the different word of,

1235
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,760
Speaker 16:  of how that should be implemented are sitting in the room

1236
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:23,360
Speaker 16:  and they'll, they'll debate that and they'll contribute to the spec

1237
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:26,960
Speaker 16:  and then also at the end of the day it's the board of

1238
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,200
Speaker 16:  directors that adopts the specification and that's

1239
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,160
Speaker 16:  when it gets published and companies can start building products based on

1240
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,960
Speaker 16:  it. And so the board of directors sets the

1241
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,840
Speaker 16:  goals for the specification, you know, these are the

1242
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,320
Speaker 16:  scenarios we wanna enable the enable, these are the new features we

1243
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,880
Speaker 16:  wanna enable, stuff like that. And then it goes to the work group and then

1244
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,800
Speaker 16:  when it's done, it comes back to the board of directors to, to sign off

1245
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,640
Speaker 16:  on. So I mean that's a way 10,000 level over simplification

1246
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,480
Speaker 16:  of how it's done. But those are the two main groups

1247
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,040
Speaker 16:  that are kind of around that table, if you will,

1248
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:10,000
Speaker 16:  for what goes in the spec and what doesn't go in the spec and where

1249
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,080
Speaker 16:  that line is drawn.

1250
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:14,320
Speaker 3:  So you got the members, you got the board of directors, they're talking about

1251
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:18,160
Speaker 3:  different parts of the, the spec. Just as a consumer, somebody who experiences

1252
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:22,120
Speaker 3:  Bluetooth every day, is there a part where you're like, all

1253
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,720
Speaker 3:  right, the world's great consumer technology and computer companies are gonna

1254
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:29,680
Speaker 3:  implement our spec, we don't have to worry about them, the car

1255
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:33,600
Speaker 3:  companies are now gonna put Bluetooth radios in their cars and

1256
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,200
Speaker 3:  that's a little dicey and maybe we should go babysit them a little bit cuz

1257
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,160
Speaker 3:  that like that's where the breakdown is, right? In the actual execution and

1258
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,560
Speaker 3:  the implementation of the standard. And some companies

1259
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,360
Speaker 3:  historically very good at it, some gigantic category of companies

1260
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,240
Speaker 3:  historically very bad at it. How do you make sure that consumer experience

1261
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:51,680
Speaker 3:  stays good?

1262
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:55,800
Speaker 16:  Well that's, that's a difficult one because the consumer

1263
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,760
Speaker 16:  experience isn't in the specification itself and that

1264
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:04,200
Speaker 16:  actually with Bluetooth anyway is very entrenched within the

1265
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:08,480
Speaker 16:  original grue of the organization and how it

1266
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:12,440
Speaker 16:  was formed that the user experience not be in the

1267
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,680
Speaker 16:  specification that that's something that really yes. That the companies

1268
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,880
Speaker 16:  can do on their own.

1269
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:19,960
Speaker 3:  Why is that?

1270
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:26,080
Speaker 16:  Well the, the, when Bluetooth

1271
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,880
Speaker 16:  formed, it was a lot of big companies

1272
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:34,000
Speaker 16:  coming together to do this specification and all of

1273
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,880
Speaker 16:  'em had very strong opinions on what

1274
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,640
Speaker 16:  the user interface should look like and how it should

1275
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,240
Speaker 16:  be. And you know, one of the things that when I first started

1276
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,120
Speaker 16:  working with Bluetooth, I worked for Microsoft and I was on the board of

1277
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,800
Speaker 16:  directors, I chaired the board of directors and things like that and I negotiated,

1278
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,640
Speaker 16:  there was part of the team that negotiated the deal for Microsoft

1279
01:09:56,650 --> 01:10:00,640
Speaker 16:  to join the Bluetooth sig and back in Redmond in

1280
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,400
Speaker 16:  the meetings, you know, one direction that I received very loud

1281
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,160
Speaker 16:  and clearly is, you know, some group of other companies

1282
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,760
Speaker 16:  is not gonna tell us what the user dinner base in Windows

1283
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:15,800
Speaker 16:  is. And you know, and one time when

1284
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,920
Speaker 16:  I, I went to Ericsson, you know, this was 99,

1285
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,520
Speaker 16:  2000 timeframe. So at that time Ericsson was a very

1286
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,360
Speaker 16:  big cell phone manufacturer and I had what I thought was

1287
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:30,880
Speaker 16:  a great idea for how Bluetooth should be in the phone and how it should

1288
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,760
Speaker 16:  implement with Windows and some with their head UI guy for

1289
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,720
Speaker 16:  phones and give them this idea. And he kind of

1290
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,200
Speaker 16:  stares blankly at me and I said, come on, I couldn't take you more than

1291
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,120
Speaker 16:  a week to implement this feature. And he said, no, it'll be

1292
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,080
Speaker 16:  six months because it'll take five and a half months for you to

1293
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:54,040
Speaker 16:  convince me to do it and then two weeks for me to do it. You know,

1294
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,280
Speaker 16:  so, so all these companies had very strong

1295
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,440
Speaker 16:  impressions of how the UI on

1296
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,120
Speaker 16:  the devices that they made and their experts at should

1297
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,680
Speaker 16:  work and you know, some kid from another company

1298
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:12,240
Speaker 16:  shouldn't come and tell them how it should be. And

1299
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,840
Speaker 16:  you know, know when I worked at Microsoft they wouldn't allow it. Erickson

1300
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,680
Speaker 16:  wouldn't, Nokia sure as heck wouldn't allow it. And so, you know,

1301
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,560
Speaker 16:  none of the companies involved back then would allow

1302
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,280
Speaker 16:  that. And so to kind of roll back to your question though,

1303
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,080
Speaker 16:  one of the things we did do is we had put out,

1304
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:35,440
Speaker 16:  you know, guidelines and the Bluetooth sig

1305
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:39,280
Speaker 16:  you, you mentioned the car scenario. One of the things we did is we

1306
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,840
Speaker 16:  did consumer focus groups and brought, you know,

1307
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,840
Speaker 16:  consumers, regular people that may or may not have ever used

1308
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,800
Speaker 16:  Bluetooth and stuck 'em in a car and stuck them in, you know, many, many

1309
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,440
Speaker 16:  different types of cars. Not always the same person but you know, different

1310
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,120
Speaker 16:  people in different cars and had them try to pair a

1311
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,000
Speaker 16:  phone with the car and sometimes as you

1312
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,800
Speaker 16:  said, it went very smoothly, sometimes it didn't. But there was some

1313
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,120
Speaker 16:  very clear things that consumers

1314
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,600
Speaker 16:  expected and kind of wanted to follow the flow through and

1315
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,480
Speaker 16:  some that the cars did that they weren't expecting at all. And so we

1316
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:21,280
Speaker 16:  were able to put that into a, a paper and give some guidelines and

1317
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,360
Speaker 16:  share that with all the car manufacturers that were members. And that

1318
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,800
Speaker 16:  helped some, you know, as you said, they're, they're still not all perfect

1319
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,200
Speaker 16:  than things, but I, I do think it's better than

1320
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:36,480
Speaker 16:  when cars first started implementing Bluetooth.

1321
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:40,920
Speaker 3:  So you have a PhD or an engineer by training. You used to work

1322
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:44,760
Speaker 3:  on the actual wireless standards at Microsoft. Every time

1323
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,360
Speaker 3:  I talk to someone in your position or someone who's been in your position

1324
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,160
Speaker 3:  as standards body, I come away thinking, oh this is a politics

1325
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,040
Speaker 3:  job. This person had to become a politician. Cuz what you are describing

1326
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,920
Speaker 3:  is less engineering and way more politics. Is that how you see it, that this

1327
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,360
Speaker 3:  is a, a political job?

1328
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:05,640
Speaker 16:  Well there's definitely that part of it and you're a salesman

1329
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,640
Speaker 16:  who's as well, no doubt about that. But I

1330
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,320
Speaker 16:  think at least in my own experience, having

1331
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,920
Speaker 16:  the technical background enabled me to

1332
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,800
Speaker 16:  speak to the people that were making the specifications, you know,

1333
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:24,480
Speaker 16:  at the radio level I understood that level at the upper

1334
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,440
Speaker 16:  layers, I understood that level and I think at least with Bluetooth and

1335
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,280
Speaker 16:  my personal experience, that helped a lot with the

1336
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,280
Speaker 16:  specifications. But as you said, with talking with

1337
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,560
Speaker 16:  members and press and analyst and stuff,

1338
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,640
Speaker 16:  I, I didn't use that part of my background nearly as

1339
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:43,880
Speaker 3:  Much.

1340
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:49,360
Speaker 3:  I wanna let Alex and Chris ask some questions to wrap us up. But here's my,

1341
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,400
Speaker 3:  my my final question. I look at the state of Bluetooth today

1342
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,000
Speaker 3:  and it can do a lot of things. It has more capabilities than ever,

1343
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:01,120
Speaker 3:  but it, it's narrowed to the audio use case in

1344
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:05,000
Speaker 3:  almost every circumstance, right? Like air AirPods and Galaxy Buds

1345
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,520
Speaker 3:  and Pixel buds are all great and they have all these capabilities and that's

1346
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,080
Speaker 3:  great and pairing with your car is great and spatial audio is

1347
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,200
Speaker 3:  whatever it is. But the universe of other things that

1348
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:20,040
Speaker 3:  Bluetooth could do has been supplanted by other

1349
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:24,120
Speaker 3:  lower power technologies has been supplanted by things like wifi, Bluetooth

1350
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,840
Speaker 3:  and wifi work together now in many cases, do you see that narrowing or

1351
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,080
Speaker 3:  am I missing something big?

1352
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:33,400
Speaker 16:  Well, it audio was the original killer use case and it

1353
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,200
Speaker 16:  went from voice audio to stereo audio and now it's going

1354
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:41,200
Speaker 16:  stereo audio over the low energy channel. And so

1355
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,000
Speaker 16:  audio has been, and I think will continue to be a,

1356
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,800
Speaker 16:  a major, major feature or part of what Bluetooth is

1357
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,800
Speaker 16:  and enables. I do think though in a lot of other

1358
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,040
Speaker 16:  devices like the medical, the fitness and things like that,

1359
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:00,000
Speaker 16:  Bluetooth can still be adopted and used there

1360
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:03,560
Speaker 16:  as well. Having the connection to pretty much every

1361
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,320
Speaker 16:  smartphone out there is still a, a big advantage for

1362
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,400
Speaker 16:  those other type of use cases and makes

1363
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:14,840
Speaker 16:  some other technologies, at least for the consumer

1364
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:18,920
Speaker 16:  side, harder to enter because you don't have that cell phone connectivity.

1365
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:23,000
Speaker 16:  Now in the industrial world and things like that where

1366
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,880
Speaker 16:  you're doing the entire vertical, you know, in-house if

1367
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,200
Speaker 16:  you will, if you're doing automation on a

1368
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,480
Speaker 16:  manufacturing floor, you know that that cell phone

1369
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,240
Speaker 16:  connection may not be as important because you'll just create your

1370
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,000
Speaker 16:  own basically access point or connectivity point for whatever

1371
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,960
Speaker 16:  technology you're using. So you use the best technology that's fit

1372
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,760
Speaker 16:  for that particular job. So I think that's a harder

1373
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:53,560
Speaker 16:  nut, if you will, for Bluetooth to crack than the more consumer

1374
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:57,160
Speaker 16:  ones where the phone is such a vital component in it.

1375
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:59,920
Speaker 8:  So I've been at the Verge for a while and I feel like there was a period

1376
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,800
Speaker 8:  a few years ago where we often wrote about BLE low energy and these

1377
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,840
Speaker 8:  beacons and this notion that you would like welcome into a store and the

1378
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,640
Speaker 8:  app for like Walmart or Target would like guide you to the aisle or shelf

1379
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,960
Speaker 8:  where the thing you wanted was, and that never really happened.

1380
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,800
Speaker 8:  So do you think like there are times where the tech industry just gets maybe

1381
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,080
Speaker 8:  too ambitious with Bluetooth and uses it in ways that sound nice and concept,

1382
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,520
Speaker 8:  but in practice or a hassle or not really what it's meant for when it comes

1383
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,040
Speaker 8:  down to it?

1384
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:28,040
Speaker 16:  Well, you're right, the, the low energy beacons, there's a lot of

1385
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:31,880
Speaker 16:  hype around those for a while and it might have been

1386
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,800
Speaker 16:  one of those, if you build it, they will come type of things, but

1387
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,480
Speaker 16:  not as many people came as, as some people had hoped.

1388
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,480
Speaker 16:  You know, even back at the beginning I was talking about the scenarios

1389
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,880
Speaker 16:  that you're enabling, you know, I tested with

1390
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:50,880
Speaker 16:  Bluetooth, low energy beacons around a target and you know, it'll

1391
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:54,520
Speaker 16:  show you where the item is and map you to it and stuff,

1392
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:59,080
Speaker 16:  but you know, I I don't really know how compelling that is. You know,

1393
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,800
Speaker 16:  most people can walk around the target and, and find the stuff and,

1394
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,720
Speaker 16:  and part of walking around the, the target is, is the journey

1395
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,080
Speaker 16:  that people enjoy when they're shopping it, you know, so

1396
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:14,040
Speaker 16:  pulling out your phone and having it do all of that, yeah, maybe

1397
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,000
Speaker 16:  has some value, but I don't know if it's really a killer type

1398
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,200
Speaker 16:  scenario. So the the, the scenarios have to be good and consumers

1399
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,720
Speaker 16:  have to, you know, want them and, and be willing to use them

1400
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,840
Speaker 16:  where the beacon scenario might not have been there. Now if you

1401
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,240
Speaker 16:  easily push good coupons to them and things like that and

1402
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:38,120
Speaker 16:  it saved them some money, then people might be more inclined to use

1403
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:39,640
Speaker 16:  that sort of application.

1404
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:44,080
Speaker 4:  What element of Bluetooth that you worked on was like just the part

1405
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,040
Speaker 4:  you really, really are super proud of and like you probably bring up

1406
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,840
Speaker 4:  in a conversation with people who know nothing about Bluetooth.

1407
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:55,360
Speaker 16:  Well, it was mentioned earlier about how

1408
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:59,640
Speaker 16:  Bluetooth and, and y came together and that turned

1409
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,600
Speaker 16:  into Bluetooth low energy in the, in the Fort Auto spec and

1410
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,440
Speaker 16:  that whole process and going through and working

1411
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,080
Speaker 16:  out the deal for that and getting this specification

1412
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:14,960
Speaker 16:  done, you know, that was really something and that really set

1413
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,800
Speaker 16:  the foundation for what Bluetooth is and became for the,

1414
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,480
Speaker 16:  for this last decade, you know, for the next 10 years af

1415
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:26,320
Speaker 16:  after that was done. So, you know, that was very

1416
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:29,040
Speaker 16:  good, very proud of that. And how, how that's turned out.

1417
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:32,640
Speaker 3:  Were you like, I gotta take these library guys, they're coming from me.

1418
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:36,680
Speaker 16:  No, no, no, no. They, they

1419
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,600
Speaker 16:  actually believed that the Bluetooth sig was probably the best way to get

1420
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,640
Speaker 16:  the technology out there as well, rather than

1421
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:47,880
Speaker 16:  recreating everything that the Bluetooth sig had. Because people I

1422
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,520
Speaker 16:  don't think realize, and the consumer shouldn't have to

1423
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,400
Speaker 16:  realize this, but you know, creating a standard like that and

1424
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,800
Speaker 16:  getting the technology out there takes a lot of time,

1425
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:02,800
Speaker 16:  energy, money, resources, infrastructure, just all

1426
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,760
Speaker 16:  these things and duplicating that for each technology is

1427
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,720
Speaker 16:  very wasteful in the industry. And so being able to

1428
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,640
Speaker 16:  bring those two together, you know, saved companies a lot of

1429
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,400
Speaker 16:  money, I think made it easier for the consumer when the actual

1430
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:22,320
Speaker 16:  low energy came out because it got put into phones right away because people

1431
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,280
Speaker 16:  made dual mode chip sets right away. And so it,

1432
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,080
Speaker 16:  it was definitely a win-win for both organizations, for

1433
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:33,800
Speaker 16:  the consumer, for the members, et cetera. So,

1434
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:37,720
Speaker 16:  no, it wasn't like you're going out and saying, you know, we, we have to

1435
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,800
Speaker 16:  just take over these guys.

1436
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:42,280
Speaker 3:  It's a nice low power wireless speck you have there. It would be a shame

1437
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,920
Speaker 3:  if anything happen

1438
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,520
Speaker 16:  To, yeah, exactly.

1439
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:48,720
Speaker 3:  All right, let's wrap it up here. Thank you so much, Mike for joining us

1440
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:52,680
Speaker 3:  on the Vergecast Bluetooth holiday. Spectacular. It would be

1441
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,720
Speaker 3:  a crime if I didn't ask this, our listeners would kill me. The joke we've

1442
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,840
Speaker 3:  had that a lot of folks, a lot of people who report on consumer technology

1443
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,880
Speaker 3:  have for years about Bluetooth is that Bluetooth will be better next year.

1444
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:05,400
Speaker 3:  And that has just always been the answer for a decade plus of Bluetooth

1445
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:09,000
Speaker 3:  in the spirit of the holidays. Will Bluetooth be better next year?

1446
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,240
Speaker 16:  Maybe? I dunno,

1447
01:20:15,950 --> 01:20:19,840
Speaker 16:  it's, it's pretty damn good now and it, it will continue

1448
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,840
Speaker 16:  to do more things.

1449
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,360
Speaker 3:  That's amazing. Mike, thank you so much for joining the broadcast Bluetooth

1450
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,840
Speaker 3:  holiday spectacular. This is great.

1451
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:27,080
Speaker 16:  All right, thanks.

1452
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,960
Speaker 3:  And with that, the Vergecast Bluetooth holiday spectacular

1453
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:40,200
Speaker 3:  comes to a close, children are sleeping or headsets are charging

1454
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:43,360
Speaker 3:  and Bluetooth. Well, honestly, we don't know if Bluetooth will be better

1455
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:47,320
Speaker 3:  next year, which we'll just have to try again. Thank you for joining us

1456
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:51,200
Speaker 3:  on the Vergecast Bluetooth holiday spectacular. We enjoyed having you. I

1457
