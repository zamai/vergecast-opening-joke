34
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,080
Speaker 4:  a bonkers fall tech season. So September

35
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,640

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,440
Speaker 4:  me that that's just, it's the bomb in the middle of my

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,240
Speaker 4:  calendar. But there is this Apple event. There's the Amazon event. There's

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,840
Speaker 4:  a Microsoft event. There's a Google event. Oh,

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,360
Speaker 5:  You've forgotten meta.

40
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,160
Speaker 4:  There's a meta event. It's just, it's all happening. There's

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,320
Speaker 5:  Also a one plus event. Mm. There's a Qualcomm event. Everybody

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,200
Speaker 5:  Love five G's on the beach, baby.

46
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,800
Speaker 4:  You love it. We've patent moat. You can anything you want, just pay us the

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,480
Speaker 4:  money. And they make everybody go to Hawaii. Yes, modems,

48
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,400
Speaker 4:  they love it. But just a like literally every week. So much so

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,320
Speaker 4:  that we made a calendar you can subscribe to on our website. It'll

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,760
Speaker 4:  just give you alerts and you can just like come look at events as this month

51
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,640

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,400
Speaker 4:  we make calendars? I cal. We did it. So just a

53
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,800
Speaker 4:  bonkers month, including today, the

54
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,600
Speaker 4:  antitrust trial of our lives like kicked off us

55
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,480
Speaker 4:  versus Google illegal monopoly

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,240
Speaker 4:  claims about the search engine and its dominance. The parallel is to us

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,480
Speaker 4:  versus Microsoft, which is 25 years ago.

58
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,280
Speaker 5:  Which to be clear, I was alive for.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,640
Speaker 6:  I think we all were.

60
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,320
Speaker 4:  I mean, I hope so.

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,880
Speaker 5:  I just wanna say like it Is this the trial of our lives? It could be.

62
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,520
Speaker 5:  Or was Microsoft

63
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,840
Speaker 4:  Mic. So the end of the Microsoft trials, what created Google and like created

64
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,920
Speaker 4:  the opportunity for Google to exist. I just, whatever that all happened,

65
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,920
Speaker 4:  it's all in the past. Addie Robertson was in the courthouse today listening

66
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,560
Speaker 4:  to opening arguments. It immediately got very technical. What is a search

67
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,120
Speaker 4:  engine? A real question our government is currently grappling with. We will

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,440
Speaker 4:  have Addie on the show on Friday. Obviously I'm very interested in this.

69
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,520
Speaker 4:  We're gonna focus on Apple today. But just a bonkers month has

70
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,400
Speaker 4:  kicked off with this Apple event and with this Google trial. Google trial

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,680
Speaker 4:  by the way, is for 10 weeks. So we'll be talking about this for the next

72
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,320
Speaker 4:  two and a half months. But we're not gonna talk about it today. Today we're

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,600
Speaker 4:  gonna talk about Apple Degreed.

74
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,600
Speaker 6:  Yes. Yeah.

75
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,320
Speaker 4:  No one wants to define what a search engine is today. Not

76
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,840
Speaker 6:  Is the in the slightest

77
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,760
Speaker 4:  Is. I have a lot to say about this, but we'll talk about it on Friday. Let's

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,040
Speaker 4:  talk about this Apple event. It, we were all recently here for Apple Vision

79
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,880
Speaker 4:  Pro. The vibes that one were excited. They were,

80
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,080
Speaker 4:  everyone was like kind of on edge, like they didn't know how it was would

81
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,720
Speaker 4:  go. There was a lot of expectations. They built a big structure in the middle

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,280
Speaker 4:  of campus and we had to go to it and there was like

83
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,640
Speaker 4:  new age music playing and then you ascended in a headset, whatever it, but

84
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,680
Speaker 4:  You know. It was that thing where it was like everyone wanted to know how

85
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,840
Speaker 4:  it would go. There was just a lot of curiosity in every direction. This event

86
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,440
Speaker 4:  was not that.

87
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,280
Speaker 5:  We kind of knew what was gonna happen.

88
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,000
Speaker 4:  We, we knew it was gonna happen. It was an iPhone. We know how to cover

89
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,520
Speaker 4:  new iPhones. Yeah.

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,800
Speaker 5:  We've done a few. Right.

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,360
Speaker 4:  There was just like an element of this where it was like, it was comfy. Like

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,160
Speaker 4:  everyone was just like back home. You know. So the vibes I think were just

93
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,800
Speaker 4:  like different because of that. And even to me, apple

94
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,560
Speaker 4:  like started off by saying like, this is our biggest event of the year. And

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,280
Speaker 4:  I was like, really?

96
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,560
Speaker 6:  I don't wanna say it was chill, but I feel like I was

97
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,200
Speaker 6:  chill in a way that I'm normally not for these events. I was just like, okay,

98
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,920
Speaker 6:  I can go into V Auto V mode. Yeah. Where it's just like,

99
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,000
Speaker 6:  I know what I'm doing. I'm not gonna freak out. I'm not on autopilot.

100
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,600
Speaker 6:  But like there's no like, oh my God.

101
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,360
Speaker 6:  Like last year when they called it the Ultra, I was like, oh my God, I have

102
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,200
Speaker 6:  to do so many find and replaces in this moment. My stress levels are through

103
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Speaker 6:  the roof. This was like, nah, no, I'm chill and cool. I know what's going

104
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,320
Speaker 6:  on.

105
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And they had us in the Steve Jobs theater, which is like an easy place

106
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,800
Speaker 4:  to kinda like do this work.

107
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,320
Speaker 5:  It's very comfortable. It's

108
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,680
Speaker 4:  It's comfy. That's right. Nice. The vibes of this event were comfy. It was

109
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,360
Speaker 4:  a video event again, which kind of made me sad. I was hoping that they would

110
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,480
Speaker 4:  come out on stage and actually do it. We all, all watch the video together.

111
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,280
Speaker 4:  Again, the point of this is actually us holding the phones in devices at

112
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,000
Speaker 4:  the end, not the presentation, but it's really weird to be

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
Speaker 4:  just watching TV with like a bunch of other people and Dan sitting next to

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,120
Speaker 4:  me taking pictures of the tv. Yeah, it's,

115
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,320
Speaker 5:  It's a very odd experience to spend an hour and a half taking photos of a

116
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,160
Speaker 5:  tv. It's a nice

117
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,080
Speaker 4:  Tv. It's a very nice tv. Yeah. So it opened with a video

118
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,200
Speaker 4:  of people celebrating their birthday and it was revealed that all the people

119
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,000
Speaker 4:  in the video had their lives saved by an Apple device. Fine.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,720
Speaker 4:  This is great. I'm happy all these people are alive. I'm dying to know

121
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,080
Speaker 4:  if Apple staged all those birthday parties.

122
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,720
Speaker 6:  It had to have been, the angles were too crisp. Right?

123
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,080
Speaker 4:  Like you watched that video was, and you're like, here, like at some point

124
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,840
Speaker 4:  the richest company on earth descended on this person. Yeah. And I was like,

125
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,440
Speaker 4:  here's what we'd like to do. We'd like you to have a birthday party.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,720
Speaker 5:  I have three kids, we have a lot of birthday parties. I've taken photos and

127
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,360
Speaker 5:  video at a lot of birthday parties and they never go that smoothly. No. Yeah.

128
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,840
Speaker 5:  As like You know that they came out with the cakes. With the candles.

129
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,440
Speaker 5:  Everyone had remembered to turn off the lights and didn't turn them back

130
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,760
Speaker 5:  on. I'll, I'll tell you also,

131
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,880
Speaker 4:  They were in, they were with them when they were waking up in the morning.

132
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah.

133
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,760
Speaker 5:  And I'll tell you one little side weird story. I got a lot of

134
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,360
Speaker 5:  dumb smart home stuff in my house, including like motion sensors. And what

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,280
Speaker 5:  happens is every time we go to like sing happy birthday, we'll turn off

136
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,600
Speaker 5:  the lights and then two words into happy birthday, the lights come back on

137
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,080
Speaker 5:  and So, we fight with the

138
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,960
Speaker 4:  Lighting switch. That's pretty good.

139
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,800
Speaker 5:  None of this happened in Apple's birthday parties. Yeah, I'm just saying

140
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,280
Speaker 5:  that and

141
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,360
Speaker 4:  All, and all the homes are beautiful. I was just like watching this. And

142
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,320
Speaker 4:  again, I think it's great that the features are helping real people. Apple's

143
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,560
Speaker 4:  obviously very proud of this. I was just watching this ad and I was like,

144
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,520
Speaker 4:  they had to, they had to do this. Like there were like a lot of cameras

145
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,200
Speaker 4:  up in these people and they had to like feel the emotions. It was just a

146
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,560
Speaker 4:  weird way also to enter this event for me. They

147
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,400
Speaker 5:  Had to produce it in a time span. And I don't know if you all know this,

148
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,520
Speaker 5:  but not everyone has the same birthday at the same time. So I'm guessing

149
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
Speaker 5:  that a lot of these are just fake.

150
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,480
Speaker 4:  I have the most questions about the birthday party video of almost any product

151
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,560
Speaker 4:  here. Like I, there's, we'll get to it. I have one big question about the

152
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,280
Speaker 4:  iPhone 15 Pro. It's huge. But the birthday party video,

153
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,960
Speaker 4:  the more you consider it, the more you're like the production of this had

154
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,760
Speaker 4:  to have been so weird. I

155
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,600
Speaker 6:  Like, if you think about, you always do it once for safety too, when you

156
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,640
Speaker 6:  do any video. Yeah. Like that's like the kind of behind the scenes thing.

157
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,320
Speaker 6:  So you had to have someone light this cake multiple times and bring it out

158
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,800
Speaker 6:  and be like, yeah, do it

159
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,040
Speaker 4:  Again. Did you notice the one? She's like, can I blow out these candles out?

160
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,000
Speaker 4:  And I was like, she said that for real. That was real. Oh, she was what?

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,360
Speaker 4:  Anyway, so that was like the opening of it. And then Tim Cook You know, it

162
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,960
Speaker 4:  was like, I wanna give you an update on the Vision Pro, which they just announced.

163
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,600
Speaker 4:  And he said, we're on track. The developers love it. I don't know what else

164
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,360
Speaker 4:  you would've said. Developers are deeply confused about our new product,

165
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,040
Speaker 4:  we're excited about the things we're seeing. It's on track to ship early

166
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,800
Speaker 4:  next year.

167
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,800
Speaker 5:  That's it.

168
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,520
Speaker 4:  That's, and that's all we got from Vision Pro. There are some stuff with

169
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,000
Speaker 4:  the iPhone where the, the pros can shoot spatial video for Vision Pro.

170
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,240
Speaker 4:  Some stuff with AirPods, which we'll get to that. That was all the updates

171
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,920
Speaker 4:  on the, on the Mac and Vision Pro. The Mac update was like, they're great.

172
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,880
Speaker 5:  People love the Mac.

173
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You know, like we continue to manufacture Macintosh's. And then

174
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,080
Speaker 4:  the other, just other video that we should talk about before we talk about

175
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,800
Speaker 4:  the products. They did a big skit in the middle of the Apple Watch

176
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,680
Speaker 4:  segment with Octavia Spencer, who was a great actress in the skit. Was

177
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,000
Speaker 4:  funny. Although it was cringey but funny. Yeah, it was, well it was well

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,960
Speaker 4:  done if you like that sort of thing. That's about

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,880
Speaker 4:  Apple's environmental efforts. They've announced a lot of

180
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,840
Speaker 4:  stuff. Elisa Jackson, by the way, used to run the E p A. She's their VP of

181
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,600
Speaker 4:  environment there. The series nine has recycled cobalt in the battery.

182
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,200
Speaker 4:  The sport loop is 82% recycled yarn. The manufacturing is carbon

183
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,080
Speaker 4:  neutral, on and on and on. There's a whole list. And then

184
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,200
Speaker 4:  they announced that the Apple watches its first carbon neutral

185
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,880
Speaker 4:  product with a logo on the side if you buy it with certain bands.

186
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,560
Speaker 6:  Yes. It has to be specific bands. It's like the

187
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,240
Speaker 4:  Ocean band will instantly harm the ocean. Yes.

188
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,000
Speaker 6:  That floral elastomer. It's not, it's not

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,240
Speaker 6:  biodegradable. Yeah.

190
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,880
Speaker 4:  The video is, it was fine. It's like, this is, if you're gonna announce a

191
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,800
Speaker 4:  litany of environmental accomplishments, that's like the

192
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,360
Speaker 4:  best way to do it. Like it was worth paying attention to. Yeah. But it was

193
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,880
Speaker 4:  also just like,

194
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,780
Speaker 4:  there's no reference frame for anything They were saying. They're like, other

195
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,140
Speaker 4:  companies plant trees. We plant forests and it's like, does Google Plant,

196
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:14,620
Speaker 4:  I don't know.

197
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,380
Speaker 7:  But they, I was like, okay, this is a clever way to stay all this and

198
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,140
Speaker 7:  like keep us engaged. But then they went and like repeated everything

199
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,220
Speaker 7:  that was said in the video in like a less funny, serious way. After

200
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,100
Speaker 7:  that, I was like, oh, I, I don't need to hear this again. It's,

201
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,780
Speaker 6:  It's also weird because it felt like the whole premise of the video was

202
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,740
Speaker 6:  skepticism and them answering that skepticism. So obviously if You know

203
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,220
Speaker 6:  anything about the environment, you're gonna be like, okay, how much of this

204
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,740
Speaker 6:  is greenwashing? Half of us have watched John Oliver talk about like

205
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,700
Speaker 6:  credits then why those aren't like real things, but they're like, no,

206
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,100
Speaker 6:  we have the answers here. Mother Nature is like kind of happy with

207
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,740
Speaker 6:  our answers. We're gonna have this really funny stare down that

208
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,940
Speaker 6:  is, I don't know, it was funny. It was funny. I just don't know. Like

209
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,420
Speaker 6:  You know. You're supposed to have Tim Cook in this video and I was like,

210
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,060
Speaker 6:  You know what Tim Cook can act, he can act like he's afraid of Octavia Spencer

211
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,020
Speaker 6:  and like as if he's on the spot. But at the same time, You

212
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,540
Speaker 6:  know back in your head that Apple is just doing that to kind of head off

213
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,100
Speaker 6:  the criticisms about greenwashing.

214
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,500
Speaker 4:  Right. This is like the frame of the video. That's what I mean. Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,260
Speaker 4:  By the way, Tim Cook spent years pretending to be afraid of Donald Trump.

216
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,980
Speaker 4:  So like, I mean like this is his greatest accomplishment is like

217
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,220
Speaker 4:  China Trump politics. Like he navigated Apple through, he is

218
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,420
Speaker 4:  a good actor, but it was just, it was, it's worth talking about. Like that

219
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,980
Speaker 4:  was a long video in the middle of this event, like really long.

220
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,980
Speaker 4:  And I think it speaks to sort of, again, just the general vibe of the whole

221
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,860
Speaker 4:  show was like, we have a lot of time to bring out Octavia Spencer

222
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,940
Speaker 4:  and do a skit about the environment. Like a long time. Yeah.

223
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,520
Speaker 4:  I just want, I wanted to start with that stuff because I think if you understand

224
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,120
Speaker 4:  that stuff, I think it puts the products in the context because the

225
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,040
Speaker 4:  products themselves are inherently iterative in like

226
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,040
Speaker 4:  meaningful ways. I think they're good. Like they seem cool and,

227
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,800
Speaker 4:  and again, big question about the 15 Pro, which we'll get to. Like there's

228
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,600
Speaker 4:  a mystery in the iPhone 15 Pro, which I'm obsessed with, but the vibe of

229
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,120
Speaker 4:  the event was like, we have enough time to do comedy.

230
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,840
Speaker 4:  All right, let's talk about the phones. iPhone 15

231
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,400
Speaker 4:  or the iPhone 14 Pro remix. Yes.

232
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,360
Speaker 5:  The iPhone 14 Pro two.

233
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,280
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. But not quite two. It's like, yeah, negative

234
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,120
Speaker 4:  0.5. Yeah, it's missing a camera and some stuff.

235
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Missing some promotion. But basically it is just like

236
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,640
Speaker 5:  last year's iPhone 14 was a remix

237
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,600
Speaker 5:  of the 13 Pro. The 15 is a remix, or a

238
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,640
Speaker 5:  repackaging is probably a better way to say it, of the 14 pro from last year.

239
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,400
Speaker 5:  So you get a 48 megapixel camera, you get the dynamic

240
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,880
Speaker 5:  island. What else?

241
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,840
Speaker 7:  Slightly brighter throw the,

242
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,080
Speaker 5:  The ac the A 16 processor. Yeah, they did update the screen. It's a little

243
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,760
Speaker 5:  bit brighter. And of course they added a USB C port, which was not on last

244
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,520
Speaker 5:  year's phone. So that's like the new thing. And they rounded the sides. It's

245
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,840
Speaker 5:  a little more comfortable to hold and the the glass is matte now. What do

246
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,160
Speaker 5:  you think, Allison?

247
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,240
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it feels like last year was very much like a skip

248
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,880
Speaker 7:  the upgrade year. And this is the one that like my husband

249
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,880
Speaker 7:  bless him, is still holding onto the iPhone 10 R. I'm like, wow,

250
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,880
Speaker 7:  wow. This would be the one, like there are enough things here that are different.

251
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,680
Speaker 7:  You're gonna get the dynamic island, which like every, I don't know,

252
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,120
Speaker 7:  app developer's gonna consider going forward. So yeah,

253
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,080
Speaker 7:  it's, it's not exciting. It's like we've seen all this before, but it's

254
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Speaker 7:  just the Right, it seems like a smart kind of like

255
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,080
Speaker 7:  packaging of everything. I

256
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,240
Speaker 5:  I, I'm, I just don't know if Apple's ever going to make this phone, whether

257
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,680
Speaker 5:  it's the iPhone fifteen, sixteen, seventeen or whatever. Exciting. Right?

258
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like it's, it's, it's, it's never going to be the one where they really

259
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,800
Speaker 5:  introduce new stuff to. It's never gonna be the one where they're pushing

260
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,600
Speaker 5:  the envelope on anything. But it is the mainstream one that most

261
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,360
Speaker 5:  people will buy or a lot of people will buy at least. And if you've had a

262
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,080
Speaker 5:  phone like the tennis or the 10 R or whatever, then

263
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,000
Speaker 5:  11 and you're upgrading now four or five years later, it will be

264
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,120
Speaker 5:  a meaningful upgrade for you. But it's hard to get excited about it because

265
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,840
Speaker 5:  we saw so much of this last year. Are

266
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,880
Speaker 6:  You telling me that you are not jazzed about color injected glass?

267
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,120
Speaker 5:  I will

268
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,560
Speaker 4:  Say the atomic level, Daniel, the glass

269
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,240
Speaker 5:  Felt nice. Like the, the, the, my main takeaway from touching these phones

270
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,280
Speaker 5:  today is they felt nice. They did,

271
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,880
Speaker 4:  They felt really, really nice. Like, like the,

272
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,640
Speaker 5:  The, the, even the, the pro models and the regular models less so, but

273
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,720
Speaker 5:  they, they like, for the past few years they've been so heavy and the edges

274
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,400
Speaker 5:  are sharp and like the stainless steel is nice, but like it's kind of

275
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,480
Speaker 5:  sticky and shows your fingerprints and stuff. These you pick up and they

276
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,280
Speaker 5:  just feel soft. Yeah. And they feel nice in your hand. We did,

277
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,560
Speaker 4:  We ran into people there who said that made them feel cheap, which is fascinating.

278
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,920
Speaker 5:  Yes, yes. They didn't have the perceived value because it wasn't as heavy.

279
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,040
Speaker 5:  And I was like, ah, yeah, I'll take the lighter phone. But You know, they,

280
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,320
Speaker 5:  they rounded the corner, the edges of the frame. It's still aluminum with

281
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,080
Speaker 5:  the iPhone 15, but it, it is nicer to hold. And the, the glass is

282
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
Speaker 5:  a soft mac glass in my experience that makes things slippery.

283
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,160
Speaker 5:  So. We'll see how that goes.

284
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,240
Speaker 6:  I mean, if you use a case, you're

285
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,200
Speaker 5:  Fine. You know, most people will use a case. So

286
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,640
Speaker 4:  You know, obviously the big news here is they, again, it's the iPhone 14

287
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,840
Speaker 4:  Pro minus. That's, that's how I think about this phone. So you're,

288
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,760
Speaker 4:  you're losing a camera, you're losing the Zoom camera. Yeah, the Ultra wide,

289
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,560
Speaker 4:  the telephone. Yep. But you, you get the main camera from the 14 pro, which

290
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,120
Speaker 4:  is a 48 megapixel. They're pixel bending. It kind of an interesting way.

291
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,960
Speaker 4:  Right. They're doing 24 megapixels by default. You can switch it to 12 in

292
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,880
Speaker 4:  the settings, which is interesting. Then you can crop it in different ways

293
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,130
Speaker 4:  to get two x. And then they've changed portrait mode,

294
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,650
Speaker 4:  which seems like a big deal. But I also, so much of the

295
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,570
Speaker 4:  hands-on area is just panic, but like

296
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,290
Speaker 4:  beautifully lit panic. And you're like, well that looks fine. And you're

297
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,090
Speaker 4:  like, like the light of heaven is, is up upon me. Everything

298
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,050
Speaker 4:  looks good in this. But they are capturing the depth map when you take

299
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,130
Speaker 4:  a photo now and you can go in a portrait mode later, which is cool.

300
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,410
Speaker 7:  And you can change the focus point later, which is like, isn't it

301
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,690
Speaker 7:  the dream of like digital photography

302
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,010
Speaker 5:  Tro baby. Yeah, I

303
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,250
Speaker 4:  Know. Yeah. It's been 10 years since we've been covering this idea. If you

304
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,530
Speaker 4:  don't know what Lightro is, Lightro is a a, you can go look at it on The

305
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,770
Speaker 4:  Verge from a million years ago, they shipped a, a whole camera

306
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,330
Speaker 4:  with like 50 lenses on the front.

307
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,690
Speaker 5:  Well, no, the the, the lightro that let you change the focus point was

308
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,570
Speaker 5:  that weird rectangular thing with one lens. Oh yeah. And

309
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,450
Speaker 5:  it allowed you after the fact to choose different focus points, which is

310
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,930
Speaker 5:  this, what is the iPhone's allowing you to do? Now what you're thinking of

311
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,810
Speaker 5:  is the light phone or the light camera that had

312
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,090
Speaker 5:  the, the spider's, I a of, of of lenses

313
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,450
Speaker 5:  switch cheese on the front quickly checking this and checking it. But yeah,

314
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,810
Speaker 5:  that, yeah. Which also I believe tried to accomplish a similar thing. But

315
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,850
Speaker 5:  Lightro was first. Yeah. The problem with the lightro was a, it took terrible

316
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,730
Speaker 5:  photos. B it was expensive and C like you couldn't do

317
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,650
Speaker 5:  anything with those photos. Yeah. Oh yeah. So it was a weird

318
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,530
Speaker 7:  Format. Right?

319
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,850
Speaker 4:  It

320
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,970
Speaker 5:  Was a weird format. Yeah. The only thing, I mean, I think the whole reason

321
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,450
Speaker 5:  it existed was to like try and get that technology into other things and

322
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,970
Speaker 5:  sell it to bigger companies, but it kind of fell. So David

323
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,650
Speaker 4:  Pierce wrote our Lights Review in 2012 and it is so broken now.

324
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,370
Speaker 4:  It is not even worth a year.

325
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,570
Speaker 5:  Pullover. Look it up.

326
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,810
Speaker 4:  But yeah, 11 years ago we, we covered a camera that could refocus The new

327
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,890
Speaker 4:  portrait mode can just do it. I will say Dan and I were playing with it at

328
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,690
Speaker 4:  the event. It got a little confused sometimes. But again,

329
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,410
Speaker 4:  it's the event. There's like 900 faces at, it's like, it's not a fair

330
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,250
Speaker 4:  testament. I

331
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,090
Speaker 5:  Think. I think this the feature of the, the main thing that I think

332
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,650
Speaker 5:  people would get from this is the ability to make a non

333
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,520
Speaker 5:  portrait photo portrait Yes. After the fact. And so like

334
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,800
Speaker 5:  so many times, like You know, I think of my wife taking photos of our kids.

335
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,600
Speaker 5:  She uses the normal camera mode and, and I, I always like switch it to portrait

336
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,360
Speaker 5:  or whatever, but she never does that switchover. But now if she doesn't do

337
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,000
Speaker 5:  the switchover, it doesn't matter. It captured the data and I can like turn

338
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,680
Speaker 5:  on the portrait mode after the fact. Yes.

339
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,800
Speaker 4:  It's unclear whether you get live photos at, at the same time

340
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,480
Speaker 4:  as the portrait capture. Oh yeah.

341
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,400
Speaker 5:  We'll have to follow up with that.

342
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So there again, lots of questions there, but basically you've got

343
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,360
Speaker 4:  what should be the 14 pro camera. I'd be shocked if

344
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,800
Speaker 4:  it was meaningfully different. I don't

345
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,440
Speaker 5:  Know that it's the exact same camera sensor. It's the same resolution

346
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,160
Speaker 5:  that we know. Yeah.

347
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,960
Speaker 7:  And you get the two times lossless crop.

348
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,120
Speaker 5:  Right. 'cause you can, it can go into the center of the sensor. And then

349
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,560
Speaker 5:  the, the Benning, as you were saying earlier, is kind of doing a unique thing

350
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,360
Speaker 5:  where it's going to 24 megapixels as opposed to normally.

351
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,440
Speaker 5:  And what the iPhone has done in the past with the Pro Max or the 14 Pro

352
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,200
Speaker 5:  is it just takes four of the 48 megapixels and turns 'em into one,

353
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,160
Speaker 5:  which produces a 12 megapixel image. Yeah. So this 24 is kind of

354
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,920
Speaker 5:  a strange way to do it. Like I'm not sure how they're calculating the data

355
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,720
Speaker 5:  there, but it does give you a meaningfully more resolution without like

356
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,960
Speaker 5:  blowing up your storage.

357
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,520
Speaker 4:  But

358
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,000
Speaker 7:  Does anyone need 24 megapixels? Like on the regular, like

359
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,760
Speaker 5:  People zoom a crop all the time, I think. Yeah, but I think so. Yeah.

360
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,080
Speaker 7:  T 12 of is a good

361
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,960
Speaker 5:  Amount. This is why I, my my opinion on, on phone cameras is that telephoto

362
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,480
Speaker 5:  is always more useful than Ultra wide because I watch people go like this

363
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,760
Speaker 5:  with their phones and then pinched zoom

364
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,400
Speaker 4:  To

365
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,840
Speaker 5:  Death and they take four pixels and snap that photo. Painful.

366
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,480
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

367
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,440
Speaker 5:  And like I see 'em do that all the time. And then the Ultra wide is like,

368
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,080
Speaker 5:  oh cool, we got this really cool architectural shot. It's like, I mean it's

369
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Speaker 5:  good for like getting a group of people.

370
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,400
Speaker 4:  Oh man, I love the Ultra wide. I don't what what you're talking about. You

371
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,720
Speaker 4:  are, you

372
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,400
Speaker 6:  Are not watching the,

373
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,320
Speaker 4:  It's so Moy, how are you take a band photo

374
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,480
Speaker 6:  Where you, you flip the, the TikTok photographers are always like flip your

375
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,000
Speaker 6:  camera upside down. Yeah, yeah. Get really down and then put it into Ultra

376
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Speaker 6:  wide. And then you have like this, I don't know, this insane

377
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,240
Speaker 4:  Shot. Basically what you're saying is no matter what people will find a way

378
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,720
Speaker 4:  to make a great camera look like shit. Yes. No matter what.

379
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,720
Speaker 4:  Interestingly, we, there's some modes in this camera that are new. So you

380
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,080
Speaker 4:  can shoot 48 megapixel pro raw. You can shoot

381
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,200
Speaker 4:  24, you can shoot 12 and then you can shoot 48

382
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,000
Speaker 4:  megapixel compressed in Apple's format. Which

383
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,080
Speaker 4:  they revealed that as a company. They

384
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,200
Speaker 4:  pronounced Heif Heif. So H E I F, which I

385
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,840
Speaker 4:  get why you would head towards Heif. But they said it on

386
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,840
Speaker 4:  stage and then they were all saying it. It's been like the iPhones have

387
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,360
Speaker 4:  shot in he e f for a long time. Yeah. This is the first time I've heard anybody

388
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,280
Speaker 4:  call it Heif. It was deeply confusing. And

389
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,800
Speaker 4:  they're like, this is what we've been calling like I, I

390
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,640
Speaker 5:  I think we need to have Vergecast listeners call in or

391
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,840
Speaker 5:  hit up Neli online and say, how do you pronounce Heif? And do

392
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,480
Speaker 5:  you say Heaf?

393
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,440
Speaker 4:  No one says Heif. People say, I'm sw I'm pushing the button that says

394
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,400
Speaker 4:  maximize compatibility and shooting in jpeg. That's what everybody says.

395
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,880
Speaker 4:  They

396
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,800
Speaker 7:  Say What is this and why doesn't it work? Why

397
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,400
Speaker 4:  Doesn't does it work anywhere? Yeah. But it's, I think it's fascinating that

398
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Speaker 4:  you're letting, they're letting consumers and the iPhone 15 shoot

399
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,880
Speaker 4:  48 megapixel compressed photos, which

400
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,680
Speaker 4:  I have no idea how these are gonna look. Yeah. Just none at all.

401
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,440
Speaker 4:  Again, in the, in the demo area with beautiful light, like

402
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,760
Speaker 4:  some of the most beautiful light I've ever seen in any room is in that demo

403
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,160
Speaker 4:  area. Looks great.

404
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,480
Speaker 4:  Very curious how it'll look anywhere else. And then it's also fascinating,

405
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,320
Speaker 4:  they're letting consumers shoot 48 Megale Pro raw, which

406
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,560
Speaker 4:  they shouldn't do from, from everything. I know

407
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,640
Speaker 4:  very few people should do this. Allison. Anything else catch your eye about

408
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,480
Speaker 4:  this camera? Yeah,

409
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,280
Speaker 7:  I don't know. I think like, I think the two times crop zoom

410
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,600
Speaker 7:  makes a lot of sense here. 'cause you don't have the telephoto and you're

411
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Speaker 7:  kind of like getting something for like two lenses

412
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,440
Speaker 7:  for the price of one. And then when on a phone where you already have a three

413
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,000
Speaker 7:  times lens, it's sort of like, well what was the point of this? So yeah,

414
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,840
Speaker 7:  having, having the big one move up to five times

415
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,040
Speaker 7:  You know makes sense. And then having this, this two times option is nice.

416
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,920
Speaker 7:  It's nice for portraits. Yeah. I like it in portrait mode. So that's what

417
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,120
Speaker 7:  I'm jazzed about.

418
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,480
Speaker 4:  And then, then there's the thing, they switched the port to USB C

419
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,800
Speaker 5:  But at USB 2.0 speeds very

420
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,680
Speaker 4:  Confusing. They

421
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,000
Speaker 6:  Took forever. They took forever to get to that. Oh yeah. I feel like everybody

422
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,080
Speaker 6:  was waiting for it. And it's like, okay, okay. This

423
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,400
Speaker 5:  Big reveal,

424
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,760
Speaker 4:  They did it in two parts. They said, let's talk about connectivity. And they

425
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Speaker 4:  said, let's start with wireless and you can, the whole room was like, no

426
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,200
Speaker 4:  one cares.

427
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:32,840
Speaker 5:  Like

428
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,160
Speaker 4:  We, you talk about five G again, you're gonna do this test again. But yeah.

429
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,720
Speaker 4:  So it's USB C the You know the word from Apple

430
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,120
Speaker 4:  basically is like the Europeans made us do it,

431
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,280
Speaker 4:  but it's time and we think people aren't gonna freak out. And to, to be clear,

432
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,800
Speaker 4:  there was applause in this room.

433
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,520
Speaker 5:  I mean also from

434
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,520
Speaker 4:  Apple's employees, that's also

435
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,120
Speaker 5:  Yes. Yes. This room full of Apple's employees clapped for apple's announcement.

436
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,320
Speaker 4:  Well there were some influencers there.

437
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,400
Speaker 4:  This inside baseball as journalists, we are not supposed to clap. So there's

438
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,720
Speaker 4:  It's like a big thing. Yeah. 'cause people assume the room is full of media

439
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,840
Speaker 4:  and they hear the clapping and it's like the media's clapping and it's like,

440
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,280
Speaker 4:  no, we're sitting on our hands. We're

441
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,520
Speaker 5:  Trying to type. Yeah, we're

442
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,280
Speaker 4:  Like typing as we can. It's like Apple employees. They're partners and

443
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,240
Speaker 4:  some people who don't have to play those same rules, but they clapped, they

444
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,600
Speaker 4:  clap for iCloud storage increasing the six and 12 terabytes. That

445
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,160
Speaker 6:  And who needs that much? Who needs 12 terabytes

446
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,200
Speaker 4:  Candy crush whales.

447
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,320
Speaker 4:  I don't, I I'm just guessing. I don't know. Because

448
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,040
Speaker 6:  Like I have, I have the plan where it's two terabytes and You know. I

449
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,120
Speaker 6:  I I feel for all my friends, I share it with six of my friends. Wow.

450
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Wow. You're generous.

451
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,720
Speaker 6:  I I am. And I use most of it. Yeah. And we still have like 1.5

452
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,240
Speaker 6:  terabytes

453
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:49,240
Speaker 5:  Left. So, well, if you go buy an iPhone 15 and take 48 megapixel pro

454
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,680
Speaker 5:  raw images, you'll you'll soak up that.

455
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah. What I know every professional is dying to do is have their phone instantly

456
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,160
Speaker 4:  and immediately choke their bandwidth out by offloading their 48

457
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,160
Speaker 4:  megapixel stills to iCloud. But so USB C we did it, we just

458
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,560
Speaker 4:  did the same thing. I said we're gonna talk about USB C Yeah. We talked about

459
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,600
Speaker 4:  wireless concept and iCloud great. They

460
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,320
Speaker 4:  added it to the phone. The, the, the vibe very much was like, well, we had

461
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,240
Speaker 4:  to do it, but we think it's gonna be fine. And no further discussion

462
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,600
Speaker 4:  was had

463
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,880
Speaker 5:  No, yeah,

464
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,280
Speaker 7:  They moved on pretty quickly.

465
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,600
Speaker 4:  There is a was is it $29?

466
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,560
Speaker 5:  It's $29 dongle. Oh my God. If you wanna convert your Lightning cable

467
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,280
Speaker 5:  to USB C Absolutely not. Why you would wanna do this When you can buy an

468
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,160
Speaker 5:  Apple branded USB c cable for $19 is beyond

469
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,000
Speaker 5:  me. But s Neli and I were trying to figure out why you would buy this earlier

470
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,360
Speaker 5:  today. Ah, maybe you have a Lightning accessory.

471
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,960
Speaker 4:  What Lightning access like a

472
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,000
Speaker 5:  Battery? I don't know man.

473
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,320
Speaker 4:  Because it's a cable. So like docks are out.

474
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah, docks are out because

475
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,960
Speaker 4:  You just, your phone will be flopping. It's not even a long, it's, it's just

476
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,120
Speaker 4:  a little wi of a cable. It's

477
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,920
Speaker 5:  Just, it's just like their USB A to USB C dongle except it goes from Lightning

478
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,760
Speaker 5:  to USB. So, so it's

479
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,680
Speaker 4:  Floppy. So your phone's gonna flop right outta your dock. Yeah. So that's

480
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,000
Speaker 4:  not it.

481
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,320
Speaker 4:  I, my answer was built-in Lightning cables and cars,

482
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,880
Speaker 5:  Which I don't think are a thing,

483
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,320
Speaker 4:  Which Dan doesn't believe that they exist, but some

484
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,560
Speaker 4:  things have built-in Lightning cables. Yeah.

485
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,400
Speaker 5:  Some really weird obscure accessories that like four people bought.

486
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And now those people have to pay $20. The outrage

487
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,320
Speaker 4:  in general, I think it's like a great move. Like I don't Yeah, I think Apple

488
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,200
Speaker 4:  held out. I think the Europeans made 'em do it. I

489
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,360
Speaker 5:  I will say, I was thinking about this 'cause last week, the show, I

490
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,440
Speaker 5:  said I really don't plug in my phone for anything. This is not gonna impact

491
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,520
Speaker 5:  me much at all. I use why I was charging, but the one time I do plug my phone

492
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,480
Speaker 5:  in is when I'm in the car and I use CarPlay and I'm going to upgrade my phone

493
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,560
Speaker 5:  and have a USB C port. And my wife is not going to upgrade her phone and

494
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,200
Speaker 5:  she's gonna have a Lightning port. And now I'm gonna have to deal with the

495
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,360
Speaker 5:  fact

496
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,880
Speaker 4:  Nobody one. You're gonna buy the dongle. Buy Don. Don

497
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,040
Speaker 4:  buy the Don.

498
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,680
Speaker 7:  We have, we have dueling cables in our car. And anytime, because I'm usually

499
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,720
Speaker 7:  on an Android phone and when I switch back to iPhone, my husband's like,

500
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,280
Speaker 7:  thank God.

501
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,040
Speaker 4:  Oh my God.

502
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,080
Speaker 7:  Put this away. We can use one cable like

503
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,840
Speaker 5:  God intended. Yeah. My, my wife will get in the car and it's set up for Android

504
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,960
Speaker 5:  Auto and she'll be like, and I have to like go through the settings menu

505
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,080
Speaker 5:  to turn on CarPlay.

506
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,480
Speaker 4:  It's very obvious. Who, who's gonna have to buy the dongle and it's you.

507
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,280
Speaker 4:  That's how that goes. Look, I think it's great. They, they didn't lock it

508
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,800
Speaker 4:  down. They didn't do any weird made for iPhone stuff. They, they're not nerfing

509
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,240
Speaker 4:  the cables at slower speed. Well they nerfed the entire phone to run a USB

510
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,080
Speaker 4:  two. But charging speed should be fine over USB C

511
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,960
Speaker 4:  15 watts. We think no matter what the cable, assuming you have a good cable

512
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,560
Speaker 4:  that doesn't light itself on fire. Yeah. A real part of the USB C experience

513
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,800
Speaker 4:  transfer speeds on the pros USB C It's a standard they can do. Like they

514
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,280
Speaker 4:  did it right? They did the thing they should've

515
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,160
Speaker 5:  Done. They could have put actual us like faster USB in it and

516
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,880
Speaker 5:  they could have like done more video out or whatever. But

517
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,680
Speaker 4:  For what? For 15?

518
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,080
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Why not? It's an $800 phone. They couldn't put USB

519
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,640
Speaker 5:  three in there. How long has you spent three three been around? You could,

520
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,520
Speaker 4:  You could say it a different way. It's an $800 phone. Yeah,

521
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,840
Speaker 4:  they, that's how Apple would prefer you to say it. This is the

522
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,640
Speaker 4:  garbage phone for 800 people. $800. Yeah. U USB two. Yeah,

523
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,640
Speaker 5:  But you're right. It does, it does mean that you can now travel with one

524
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,080
Speaker 5:  charging cable, which I know on a lot of people are excited

525
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,280
Speaker 4:  About. I was on my way here and I was packing my bag full of cables. The

526
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,680
Speaker 4:  one that routinely gets me stopped at the airport as a brown man. You ever

527
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,600
Speaker 4:  fly on September 11th as a brown man, the bag full of wires and

528
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,600
Speaker 4:  batteries? Oh, it was great. I loved every minute of it, but I was packing

529
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,400
Speaker 4:  my wires You know U S P C for everything. And then my one

530
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,880
Speaker 4:  sad little Lightning cable and I was like, oh buddy. Which

531
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,160
Speaker 5:  Now you'll just need for your AirPods Max. I was like, this is

532
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,120
Speaker 4:  Your last trip little guy. You're coming with me and

533
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,160
Speaker 4:  then you're never gonna be seen again. It's interesting. They didn't upgrade

534
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,440
Speaker 4:  the AirPods Max. They did not.

535
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,840
Speaker 5:  They don't

536
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,800
Speaker 4:  Even talk about those things

537
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,760
Speaker 5:  Anymore. No, no. The rumors were as of last week, according to

538
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,800
Speaker 5:  Mark Erman, that we will see upgrades for them next year with

539
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,280
Speaker 5:  the USB C port on it. But yeah, no, no word to the USB.

540
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,320
Speaker 5:  The AirPods Max. There's like the other, we talked about this last week as

541
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,040
Speaker 5:  well, but like the other Lightning products in Apple's lineups will remain

542
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,760
Speaker 5:  though. They, today they did quietly take off

543
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,960
Speaker 5:  the, their store the MagSafe Duo charger, which had a Lightning port on it.

544
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,520
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And the MagSafe battery, which also had a Lightning port, which were

545
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,080
Speaker 5:  taken off the store not to be spoken of. They did not talk about

546
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,240
Speaker 5:  upgrading those to USB C or anything because they

547
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,480
Speaker 4:  Suck.

548
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,240
Speaker 5:  But you can still buy AirPods mags for 549.

549
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,440
Speaker 4:  You can still buy an 10 a nine gen iPad for 3 29. Yeah.

550
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,880
Speaker 5:  Which is the iPad most people should buy.

551
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I bought it. Yeah. We, we just were like children.

552
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,800
Speaker 4:  You have this iPad, you cannot hurt it in any meaningful way.

553
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,880
Speaker 4:  It's encased in rubber. I I look, I think on the 15 the port is

554
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,720
Speaker 4:  there for charging. Yeah. That it's not, it is not. No one who

555
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,080
Speaker 4:  buys an iPhone 15 is worried about their data transfer speeds.

556
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

557
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,400
Speaker 4:  No. It just doesn't seem like a thing that's

558
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,760
Speaker 5:  Happening. Oh, they did? Oh, they also came out with USB C EarPods

559
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,600
Speaker 4:  Wire ear pods. Oh, the wire ear pods.

560
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,400
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Which, which I think people would more likely use on a 15 than a 15

561
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,600
Speaker 5:  Pro.

562
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,120
Speaker 4:  Here's a question. Are they gonna work on your Mac? Hmm. 'cause

563
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,680
Speaker 4:  that would be great.

564
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,880
Speaker 5:  I mean, your Mac has a headphone jack, but Sure. If you wanna use crappy

565
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,720
Speaker 5:  EarPods, do You

566
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,440
Speaker 4:  Know? You know how they That's true. Well, I just like a lot of people

567
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,400
Speaker 4:  carry the warrant for their phones. Yeah.

568
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:24,960
Speaker 5:  And

569
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,880
Speaker 4:  If it would be nice, it's unclear if that would happen. I bet it doesn't.

570
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,680
Speaker 4:  And if it, if it does work, like next year is Max don't have headphone track

571
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,640
Speaker 4:  anymore, right? Oh man. It's just coming. So that's a 15 I gr

572
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,360
Speaker 4:  a solid upgrade. Nothing spectacular

573
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,500
Speaker 5:  Comes in five colors. They all have normal names. Yeah. There's no dumb

574
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,580
Speaker 5:  marketing names on 'em. It's just pink, yellow, green, blue and black.

575
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,420
Speaker 8:  I love it.

576
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,620
Speaker 6:  Well you didn't want it to be like Barbie, lemon grass,

577
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,260
Speaker 4:  Sky. You did. You can, you can go black. Black. Yeah.

578
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,580
Speaker 4:  You got it. Obsidian. Pure.

579
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,060
Speaker 5:  It's not space black. It's not obsidian. It's black.

580
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,460
Speaker 4:  Before we break, we should talk about the prices real quick. Yeah. iPhone

581
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,380
Speaker 4:  prices are, eh,

582
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,660
Speaker 5:  Same. So most of them are the same. the iPhone 15, the 15 plus are the

583
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,260
Speaker 5:  same as the 14 and 14 plus from last year. So we're talking 7 99 to start

584
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,900
Speaker 5:  8 99 to start on those a hundred bucks more to, if you upgrade the storage,

585
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,220
Speaker 5:  the 15 pro comes with 128 gigs of storage.

586
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,020
Speaker 5:  Starts at 9 99. Same price as before. Where it gets weird is with a

587
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,740
Speaker 5:  15 pro Max, which is now 1199. A hundred

588
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,900
Speaker 5:  dollars more than starting price of last year. But it comes with

589
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,620
Speaker 5:  256 gigs of storage, which is twice as much as last year.

590
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,100
Speaker 5:  And the same price if you got this 256

591
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,140
Speaker 5:  gig model last year. So it's like kind of a sneaky price increase.

592
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,140
Speaker 5:  Like yes. You are getting a little more. One can argue that a hundred

593
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,020
Speaker 5:  dollars is a lot of money to charge for 128 gigs of storage in this one

594
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,700
Speaker 5:  could argue the 2020 third year for Lord, but it is

595
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,460
Speaker 5:  more expensive. So like if you want the pro Max with the five x telephoto

596
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,660
Speaker 5:  lens, you are going to pay more for it this year

597
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,140
Speaker 5:  than last year.

598
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:07,140
Speaker 4:  Amortized over your phone plan. Am you're already getting scammed.

599
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,780
Speaker 4:  Yes. Like you've signed up with a major American

600
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,940
Speaker 5:  Wireless carrier. Apple loves to talk about the trade-ins. They love to talk

601
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,180
Speaker 5:  about how your iPhone holds value and that you can recoup a lot of value

602
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,340
Speaker 5:  and things like that. They, it's, they put it on a slide now. The carrier

603
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,020
Speaker 5:  promotions. Yeah. Like that's how much they wanna talk about because they

604
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,220
Speaker 5:  wanna deflect the fact that they are now charging a $1,200 starting price

605
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,140
Speaker 5:  for a phone. Yeah,

606
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,660
Speaker 4:  That's what I'm just saying. You're, you're signed up to American Wireless

607
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,740
Speaker 4:  carrier like You know. You know what you're in for. They're just coming to

608
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,220
Speaker 4:  your ass. They're just, they're one of your kids keys to your car at

609
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,700
Speaker 4:  $1,200 out the window. All right. So that's the 15.

610
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,900
Speaker 4:  We should take a break. I, I need to emotionally prepare myself for the mystery

611
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,860
Speaker 4:  of the iPhone 15 Pro. There's a lot I'm dying

612
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,660
Speaker 4:  to know. We'll be right back.

615
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,620
Speaker 8:  you are a freelancer looking for your next gig. You get an email saying you

616
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,540
Speaker 8:  should apply for this amazing job, but it's competitive. So you need to apply

617
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,420
Speaker 8:  right now. Oh. And send them money to cover a few application

618
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,500
Speaker 8:  fees. Seems weird, but you really need this job.

619
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,860
Speaker 11:  Once you think critically, you realize it's a scam.

620
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:22,100
Speaker 8:  Cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneider says, scams like this can take

621
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,820
Speaker 8:  many forms, including employment scams that trick people into paying

622
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,020
Speaker 8:  bogus fees to apply for jobs that don't actually exist.

623
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,420
Speaker 8:  Scams like this are nothing new. But now money can be transferred easier

624
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:33,980
Speaker 8:  than ever.

625
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,380
Speaker 11:  Even though it's easy, don't lose sight of the fact that it's money.

626
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,480
Speaker 11:  And when you send money to someone you don't know, that's always a

627
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,240
Speaker 11:  risk. So think twice and be careful. If it seems too good to be true,

628
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,960
Speaker 11:  it probably is.

629

647
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,640
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. The Apple event. We talked about the 15. Obviously

648
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,440
Speaker 4:  the, the interesting phone is the 15 pro in this

649
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,000
Speaker 4:  lineup. They made it out of titanium this time. It's a very, I like it. It's

650
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,280
Speaker 4:  very nice.

651
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,320
Speaker 5:  It's some titanium.

652
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,160
Speaker 4:  Some titanium.

653
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,040
Speaker 5:  There's a titanium frame, but that also connects to an aluminum frame

654
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,640
Speaker 5:  on the inside. So it's like the part you touch is titanium, but then

655
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,800
Speaker 5:  inside of it isn't aluminum

656
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,600
Speaker 4:  Frame thermo mechanically bonded. Yes.

657
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,200
Speaker 5:  Doesn't that

658
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,840
Speaker 8:  Just mean melted? Turned

659
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,520
Speaker 4:  Pushed? Yeah.

660
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,720
Speaker 8:  It sounds cooler

661
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,840
Speaker 4:  If you say thermo. Okay. Have you ever bumped into anyone in a sauna? You've

662
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,440
Speaker 4:  been thermo mechanically welders gross. I don't,

663
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,840
Speaker 4:  but that's how metals work is my understanding. It's the lightest one ever.

664
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,920
Speaker 4:  Same size as before 6 1 1 6 0.7 inches. They're very proud

665
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,800
Speaker 4:  of titanium apple, by the way, famously used titanium and another product,

666
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,280
Speaker 4:  not the Apple Watch Ultra, the titanium power book. The single coolest power

667
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,200
Speaker 4:  book ever made, which

668
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,440
Speaker 5:  Lasted about six months before it looked like garbage because they painted

669
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,800
Speaker 5:  the titanium and it all F

670
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,360
Speaker 4:  Flaked off. And also the hinges broke. Let's not talk about it at this time.

671
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,840
Speaker 4:  They said it's more repairable, which is really a big deal for Apple. Yeah.

672
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,760
Speaker 5:  That's carrying on from the iPhone 14 from last year. So now it's with the

673
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,560
Speaker 5:  pro line as well is,

674
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,880
Speaker 4:  But they're, they're saying this word out loud. They're saying repairable

675
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,680
Speaker 4:  out loud. They're basically giving into regulators, right? The Yeah. California

676
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,640
Speaker 4:  regulators want things to be repairable. This is

677
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,360
Speaker 5:  The big capitulation show for Apple. They gave in on USB C to the Europeans.

678
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,520
Speaker 5:  They gave in to California on repair

679
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,880
Speaker 4:  Big a 17 pro processor. It's three in animators, which is the industry

680
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,440
Speaker 4:  first. That's A T S M C, extreme

681
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,640
Speaker 4:  ultraviolet chip. Like Yeah, that's a big deal.

682
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,720
Speaker 5:  And rumors are the Apple bought out T SMCs entire capacity for the three

683
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,280
Speaker 5:  nanometer chips. So I would not expect to see three nanometer chips from

684
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,200
Speaker 5:  anybody else anytime soon.

685
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,840
Speaker 4:  And then they said it's a breakthrough new G P U design for Apple, their

686
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,160
Speaker 4:  first new one. It's like, guys, you, you're on the M two chip.

687
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,480
Speaker 4:  So, but they're very proud as new G P U. What's a

688
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,360
Speaker 4:  20% faster new shader architecture. They

689
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,800
Speaker 4:  have a new neural engine that's supposed to be faster. Basically it's a,

690
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,120
Speaker 4:  it does

691
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,600
Speaker 5:  Hardware Ray tracing games. Yeah,

692
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,880
Speaker 4:  Games. They games a lot about games. Yeah. They talked a lot about games

693
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,240
Speaker 4:  at this

694
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,080
Speaker 6:  Thing. Just, just No, I'm just, listen, my phone is especially is like,

695
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,960
Speaker 6:  especially made for stupid games. If I wanna

696
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,160
Speaker 6:  play good games, it's not gonna be on my phone.

697
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,920
Speaker 4:  You this mobile gaming

698
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,000
Speaker 5:  System in the world, there a lot of stupid games on consoles too.

699
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,840
Speaker 6:  Okay. Fancy stupid games. Get to be on the console. I am not

700
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,800
Speaker 6:  playing Resident Evil on my phone because as I said, the phone is gonna

701
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,600
Speaker 6:  get chucked the second there's a jump scare and then my

702
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,520
Speaker 6:  expensive phone is going to be in pieces and AppleCare Plus or

703
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,480
Speaker 6:  whatever the, the thingy is, is not gonna cover. Oh, you were scared by

704
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,480
Speaker 6:  Resident Evil and you chucked your phone at the wall. Yeah,

705
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,560
Speaker 5:  Well their, their, their whole big claim is that this is the first time a

706
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:52,200
Speaker 5:  full console game experience is available on a mobile device. What was the

707
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,360
Speaker 5:  name of the other game began with the D

708
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,480
Speaker 4:  Division? I just remember. Oh yeah. Division

709
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,600
Speaker 5:  Is like the full console experience.

710
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,520
Speaker 4:  Assassin Creed is there because there's no not a console in the world that

711
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,640
Speaker 4:  Esof won't put Assassin's Creed on. Like if you can play a game on it,

712
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,880
Speaker 4:  Assassin's Creed will be there. You'll be doing stabs on just

713
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,080
Speaker 4:  IO will be there and he'll be stabbing. But this was like a really weird

714
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,360
Speaker 4:  dichotomy in how they were talking about the Pro first. They said it's the

715
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,080
Speaker 4:  most pro phone ever, which is an incredible phrase, just a deeply

716
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,800
Speaker 4:  incredible phrase that means whatever Apple wants it to mean.

717
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,080
Speaker 4:  Like their answer to us was, we think pro features or aspirational.

718
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,960
Speaker 4:  It's the camera, it's the display and we just want this be the, and it's

719
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,840
Speaker 4:  the best that we can do. And by definition, that means every new pro

720
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,320
Speaker 4:  iPhone is the most pro phone ever made.

721
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,960
Speaker 5:  Well every new iPhone is the best iPhone ever. Right.

722
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,840
Speaker 4:  Be because they don't make worse iPhones. Like that's

723
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,880
Speaker 5:  Amazing how that works.

724
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,320
Speaker 4:  It's just, it's just really something to be the most pro phone ever. And

725
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,280
Speaker 4:  we've defined Pro in a way that we will never not make

726
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,920
Speaker 4:  the most pro phone ever. And then right next to it they're like, and

727
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,680
Speaker 4:  I, I believe they actually said out loud, this is the best mobile gaming

728
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,480
Speaker 4:  device ever made.

729
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,800
Speaker 5:  And you can also spend 14 hours in a row playing gun engine impact on it.

730
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And it's like, well then one, the Nintendo Switch exists,

731
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,240
Speaker 4:  which a deeply important mobile gaming device with maybe

732
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,480
Speaker 4:  two of the best games ever made in the Zelda games on there.

733
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,400
Speaker 4:  I don't think they're coming to the iPhone at this time. No, I'm

734
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,280
Speaker 4:  confident the iPhone is more powerful. The Nintendo Switch,

735
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,440
Speaker 5:  It's got a nicer screen too. It's got,

736
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah, like everything on the iPhone is nicer than my Switch and I have like

737
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,080
Speaker 4:  an original switch. But it's like that, that's the best one because it has

738
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,320
Speaker 4:  the best games on it then mobile games are not those games.

739
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,560
Speaker 5:  No, I mean that said, I You know, I, I'm not a mobile gamer, but I

740
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,720
Speaker 5:  know that there's an enormous market of mobile gamers out there.

741
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,480
Speaker 4:  Candy Crush Whales, candy Crush

742
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,400
Speaker 6:  Whales. It's mes

743
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,200
Speaker 4:  I spend too much. But there's You know she's a Candy Crush whale. There's,

744
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,960
Speaker 5:  There's the, the Ganon impact players and there's a lot of mos

745
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,640
Speaker 5:  played on mobile and stuff like that. So like there's definitely a market

746
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,560
Speaker 5:  here and like Apple is speaking to that market and they, this market

747
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,480
Speaker 5:  will also pay more for better performance, which

748
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,320
Speaker 5:  is what they are trying to like make the case for with the 15 product.

749
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:07,600
Speaker 5:  I

750
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,320
Speaker 6:  Just don't need Ray tracing for my beed knockoff.

751
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,680
Speaker 4:  You don't Yeah. The one that like gets your phone super hot and destroys

752
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,520
Speaker 4:  your battery. This is why your battery health is down to like 87%. Like

753
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,440
Speaker 4:  you're running a, like a Bitcoin botnet in the background of like a Beed

754
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:21,800
Speaker 4:  clone.

755
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,000
Speaker 6:  Listen, I You know I do. I need Ray tracing on Sudoku

756
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,080
Speaker 6:  Sudokus a middle, a mobile game. No I don't. Although, but you have I would

757
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,400
Speaker 6:  like to see what Ray tracing on Sudoku looks.

758
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,360
Speaker 7:  Yeah, that's what I'm

759
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,320
Speaker 4:  Saying. This is like Ultra realistic Minecraft. Yeah. Like those come out

760
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,560
Speaker 4:  like blow your mind. Look, there's somebody who said for the,

761
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,920
Speaker 4:  the fact like it's weird that they did a ray tracing explanation. Yeah. In

762
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,800
Speaker 4:  2023, like on the other side of the house, PC gamers had

763
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,120
Speaker 4:  ray tracing for a long time. That cost curve is all the way down. And then

764
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:54,040
Speaker 4:  you're like, oh this is a phone. Yeah. This is actually bonkers that they're

765
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,000
Speaker 4:  like doing it on a phone at this scale. But I have asked

766
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,120
Speaker 4:  people who use Android gaming phones to email us on the

767
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,360
Speaker 4:  show for years. Well,

768
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,480
Speaker 5:  I

769
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,920
Speaker 4:  Mean we have never gotten one email. We've gotten emails from people who

770
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,840
Speaker 4:  think they might know someone who plays games on an Android

771
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,920
Speaker 4:  phone and needs a gaming Android phone because

772
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,520
Speaker 5:  They're all playing them on iPhones. So I,

773
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,280
Speaker 4:  I mean that's, that's it. I say to you audience, I look at you

774
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,560
Speaker 4:  directly and say if you are a hardcore iPhone gamer who's gonna

775
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,880
Speaker 4:  buy a pro iPhone to play games?

776
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,000
Speaker 4:  'cause you, this is how you want to play Assassin's Creed. So lemme know.

777
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,410
Speaker 4:  I'm, I'm just dying to hear from you. I just wanna know what it's like in

778
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,370
Speaker 4:  your life in your brain. You're like, You know what Ganion impact.

779
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,610
Speaker 4:  That's that's it's

780
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,330
Speaker 5:  A popular game. That's

781
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,250
Speaker 4:  $1,500 for me

782
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,650
Speaker 5:  That's a popular game. I don't know what to say man.

783
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,250
Speaker 4:  I know it's a popular game but it's just like, and it's, it's clear the clean

784
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,090
Speaker 4:  deck exists. Like

785
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,890
Speaker 5:  Chen Impact is one of those things where it's like very clear that their

786
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,890
Speaker 5:  gaming audience is on the iPhone because it runs so much better

787
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,770
Speaker 5:  on iOS devices than on Android. And they put so much more development work

788
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,490
Speaker 5:  into Android. Allison can speak to how annoying it is to test Genin

789
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:07,010
Speaker 5:  impact on new phones and devices. 'cause it's like a 30 gigabyte download

790
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,850
Speaker 5:  on a mobile phone

791
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,570
Speaker 7:  Like four hours before I wanna play it. I am like I better start

792
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,250
Speaker 7:  downloading Genin Impact now

793
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,770
Speaker 5:  So, we we test it. We stress test devices with it all the time because it

794
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:20,530
Speaker 5:  is such an intensive thing and the iPhones and the iPadOS just run

795
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,370
Speaker 5:  circles around it and they have better silicon. But it's a lot of the fact

796
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,970
Speaker 5:  that the developers put all their work into it because that's where their

797
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:27,330
Speaker 5:  audience is.

798
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,370
Speaker 4:  What And because in-app purchases are the money for all

799
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:35,280
Speaker 4:  of these games. Yep. And 30% of those in in-app purchases are

800
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,080
Speaker 4:  the money for Apple like Apple's entire services revenue chunk

801
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,400
Speaker 4:  that the thing that's growing while iPhone sales are going down

802
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,400
Speaker 4:  the line of business that's growing for Apple's services and the biggest

803
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,240
Speaker 4:  chunk of services is in-app purchases and games. Of

804
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,560
Speaker 4:  course they want the iPhone to be an incredible gaming device

805
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,560
Speaker 4:  because if they can sell you more Ian impact stuff. Yeah.

806
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,440
Speaker 5:  I mean there's that side of it. But I think that like part of the reason

807
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,480
Speaker 5:  that they spent so much time explaining Ray tracing and showing off all these

808
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,440
Speaker 5:  capabilities and stuff is like this is where you can see the most

809
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,480
Speaker 5:  impact of a three nanometer cutting edge processor there. It's not

810
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,120
Speaker 5:  like You know if they didn't talk about that, they would be like, what your

811
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,240
Speaker 5:  email opens faster or like the brow you can switch between the browser. Like

812
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,920
Speaker 5:  we've hit the point where like I can use a phone from five years ago and

813
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,360
Speaker 5:  be just fine for my daily day-to-day work because I'm doing those kinds of

814
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,240
Speaker 5:  tasks. Whereas gaming is one area where they can push the envelope, they

815
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,760
Speaker 5:  can continue to show development and like we've made this huge investment

816
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:37,040
Speaker 5:  on this three nanometer a 17 Pro processor. I think they dropped Bionic

817
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,800
Speaker 5:  Bionics gone. Am I right? Yeah. It's

818
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,240
Speaker 4:  A 17

819
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,160
Speaker 5:  Pro. But You know and like the, they, they talked

820
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,080
Speaker 5:  about its ability to shoot pro as video and decode a V one video

821
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,760
Speaker 5:  and all this kind of stuff. But really it's the games. That's where you're

822
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,920
Speaker 5:  gonna see the notice. Notice the difference. People can buy an iPhone 15

823
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,520
Speaker 5:  that has the A 16 from last year and not skip a beat because

824
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,280
Speaker 5:  it's just fine. But if you want the best gaming things, which as we know,

825
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,200
Speaker 5:  PC gamers will literally spend thousands and thousands of dollars to get

826
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,880
Speaker 5:  the best ultimate actual, maximum performance for their games.

827
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,360
Speaker 5:  If you are a mobile gamer, best maximum performance I guess is gonna be spending

828
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,240
Speaker 5:  big on the iPhone.

829
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I'm just saying Candy Crush whales, candy crush whales. Like they

830
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,920
Speaker 4:  are, I I understand what you mean. The demos are good and they do have a

831
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,480
Speaker 4:  giant new spatial computing platform coming out.

832
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,560
Speaker 4:  There's a lot of graphics stuff they're

833
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,640
Speaker 5:  Gonna, which has an M one chip in it.

834
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,040
Speaker 4:  It

835
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,920
Speaker 4:  very confusing all the way around. We

836
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,720
Speaker 5:  Just, we skipped the most important part of the new iPhone pros thinnest

837
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,200
Speaker 5:  borders ever.

838
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,640
Speaker 4:  That's true. They're a little bit thinner. It makes the screen look a little

839
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,480
Speaker 4:  bit bigger. Yes.

840
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,320
Speaker 5:  It looks a little like I, I put it next to my 13 pro and like

841
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,200
Speaker 5:  I don't think it's any smaller, but it looks smaller.

842
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it looks a little smaller. That screen by the way. Promotion. Yeah.

843
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,440
Speaker 4:  Up to one 20 hertz. That's pretty normal. Can get brighter, can go up to

844
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,640
Speaker 4:  2000. It's of brightness. Which is pretty cool. In bright sunlight. In

845
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,400
Speaker 5:  Bright sunlight. We'll see how long it'll hold that brightness.

846
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,960
Speaker 5:  Lots of phones will juice their brightness and then 15 seconds later dimmed.

847
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,840
Speaker 5:  Unreadable. Yeah. My 13 pro does that all the time. So we'll see. But like

848
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,960
Speaker 5:  You know brighter is better. So that's, that's moving forward I guess.

849
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,200
Speaker 4:  And then obviously USB C three with camera

850
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,080
Speaker 4:  tether mode, USB USB three speeds up to

851
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,240
Speaker 4:  10 gigabits. Yeah. Which

852
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:21,720
Speaker 5:  Is actually,

853
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:21,920
Speaker 4:  They're very

854
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,200
Speaker 5:  Proud of this thing. They, they talked a lot about the things you can do

855
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,080
Speaker 5:  with that, which we saw some very comical studio setups of

856
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,680
Speaker 5:  people using iPhones to tether to much more powerful

857
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,880
Speaker 5:  computers. But the rumor mill was expecting Thunderbolt here,

858
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,040
Speaker 5:  which is four times the bandwidth of what it actually gets.

859
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,560
Speaker 5:  So it's USB three at 10 gigabits if you

860
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,360
Speaker 5:  know your USB. There's also USB three at

861
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,120
Speaker 5:  20 gigabits, which this is not. And then there's SB four which does

862
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,880
Speaker 5:  20 or 40 gigabits. And then also today Intel

863
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,520
Speaker 5:  announced Thunderbolt five, which does

864
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,440
Speaker 4:  120

865
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,360
Speaker 5:  Gigabits. So this is like, this is USB C, but it's like, or USB three.

866
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,200
Speaker 5:  But it's like one of the slowest tiers of USB three where

867
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,160
Speaker 5:  they could have, or there's potential for much faster ones. I don't know

868
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,120
Speaker 5:  if they're just setting themselves up to upgrade it later in the future or

869
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,040
Speaker 5:  if this is a limitation of the chip. It's kind of weird that You know we

870
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,760
Speaker 5:  have Thunderbolt on the iPadOS and all the Macs and things like that,

871
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,720
Speaker 5:  but it's not on the iPhone for whatever reason.

872
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,720
Speaker 4:  I think they're just managing battery life and heat. Right. It's a much smaller

873
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:27,760
Speaker 4:  chassis. All that stuff requires power, generates

874
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,240
Speaker 4:  heat. Yeah. And they don't know if anyone's gonna actually use the ship.

875
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,520
Speaker 5:  Well they aren't gonna use it outta the box. 'cause it doesn't come with

876
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,960
Speaker 5:  a USB three cable in the box.

877
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,880
Speaker 4:  But a USB three, USB C cable is like relatively inexpensive. They're

878
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,200
Speaker 5:  Relatively inexpensive. But this is the problem with USB C is that you do

879
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,000
Speaker 5:  not know looking at a cable unless it specifically says on there or you've

880
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,880
Speaker 5:  tested it yourself. What its capabilities are. Thunderbolt is the, the

881
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,680
Speaker 5:  Thunderbolt is annoying in a lot of ways. Mostly because it's expensive.

882
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,840
Speaker 5:  The cables are thicker, they have larger ends and stuff. But if it has the

883
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,240
Speaker 5:  Thunderbolt logo on there, You know what that cable is capable of. I have

884
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,080
Speaker 5:  a bag full of USB C cables right now that I do not know if it

885
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,520
Speaker 5:  charges at 60 watts, a hundred watts,

886
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,880
Speaker 5:  240 watts, I don't know. I don't know if the data supported is

887
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,840
Speaker 5:  480 megabits per second, which is USB two or is

888
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,040
Speaker 5:  it 40 gigabits per second, which

889
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:18,880
Speaker 4:  Which is Thunderball. So you take 'em all back to Apple so they can recycle

890
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,320
Speaker 4:  them into watches or whatever they're gonna do. And then you just buy good

891
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:22,800
Speaker 4:  cables.

892
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:26,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean you could do that, but you will inevitably end up with cables

893
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,160
Speaker 5:  that you do not like they C So many things come with a charging cable. You

894
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,880
Speaker 5:  don't know what it's capable of.

895
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And you just drive those directly to the Apple store. You increase

896
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,280
Speaker 4:  your carbon emissions and then you offset them by recycling the garbage cable.

897
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,520
Speaker 4:  That's how you do it. Look, I think this is, I think it's weird that when

898
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,880
Speaker 4:  you plug a cable into an iPhone, it doesn't tell you anything about the cable.

899
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,960
Speaker 4:  Yep. Like with with a Mac, you can like go and a system profile and like

900
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,800
Speaker 4:  at least suss out what's going on. This is like you're gonna plug a cable

901
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,160
Speaker 4:  with an iPhone and it's gonna tell you nothing. Just like stuff is gonna

902
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,480
Speaker 4:  start happening and it's like,

903
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,160
Speaker 5:  Or not happening.

904
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,040
Speaker 4:  The dynamic island should just be like garbage cable or like get

905
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,600
Speaker 4:  outta here. It would be really useful. Like they can do it. They have that

906
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,200
Speaker 4:  layer of information on the screen. I think Apple is just waiting to see

907
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:09,240
Speaker 4:  what people do with these USB C ports. But with capture one,

908
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,640
Speaker 4:  you can shoot 48 megapixel raw photos and tether

909
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,160
Speaker 4:  immediately, which is cool. You can shoot video directly to external storage,

910
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,800
Speaker 4:  which is cool. Yeah. Those are their big ideas basically. Camera

911
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:21,160
Speaker 4:  stuff.

912
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Because I mean, what else are you gonna do with it? Charge your

913
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,960
Speaker 4:  Phone. Charge your phone at 15. Yeah.

914
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,120
Speaker 5:  Lot. I mean like in a perfect world you would plug your USB C

915
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,920
Speaker 5:  iPhone into a studio display and get like a

916
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,640
Speaker 5:  desktop interface

917
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,960
Speaker 4:  With your a 17 Pro

918
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,480
Speaker 5:  With an A 17 Pro and the A 13.

919
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,080
Speaker 4:  This is why I need to talk about, Dan actually uses Samsung decks. I

920
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,480
Speaker 5:  Love ds.

921
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,920
Speaker 4:  He's like, he's serious about it. Talk about the action button or the, the

922
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,800
Speaker 4:  camera section. Let's do the action button quickly, I think. Okay. It's there.

923
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:51,800
Speaker 4:  You don't like it?

924
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,320
Speaker 6:  No, I like the action button on the Ultra. I think it's one of the cooler

925
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,120
Speaker 6:  things about the Ultra, but what I'm gonna say is, is that I use the

926
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,760
Speaker 6:  action button to do exactly one thug on my Ultra, which is to launch my runs.

927
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,240
Speaker 6:  And what I've noticed is that even though you can program

928
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,600
Speaker 6:  the action button on the Ultra using shortcuts, ain't nobody got time for

929
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,400
Speaker 6:  that. Ain't nobody got time to think about, well, some

930
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,000
Speaker 4:  People do that stuff.

931
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,520
Speaker 6:  Some people have that time. Pro

932
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:15,880
Speaker 5:  Users,

933
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,680
Speaker 6:  Most people ain't nobody got time for for thinking about how they're

934
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,360
Speaker 6:  gonna do that. So for me, the problem with the action button on the Ultra

935
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,080
Speaker 6:  is that it has so much potential, but it's really for the average

936
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,960
Speaker 6:  person, kind of hemmed in by what the presets are. So if

937
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,200
Speaker 6:  the presets for this action button on the phone aren't great, you're just

938
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,320
Speaker 6:  gonna be like, well, I miss my old Well,

939
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,240
Speaker 5:  I think I, I, I, I hear you. I, I feel the same way about the, the, the button

940
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,280
Speaker 5:  on the watch. I think it's, it's neutered by the fact that it's on the watch

941
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,920
Speaker 5:  and the platform of the watch the phone. I think it is more

942
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,880
Speaker 5:  practical to use it to launch a shortcut, which is one of the preset options.

943
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,680
Speaker 5:  The others are, by default, it will just control your

944
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,360
Speaker 5:  ringer. And it's always a long press. So you long press it to switch between

945
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,640
Speaker 5:  silent and ringing modes. You can also launch the camera with it.

946
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,560
Speaker 5:  You could launch the flashlight with it. You can launch an accessibility

947
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,720
Speaker 5:  shortcut. So if you use the back tap thing to pull down your notification

948
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,360
Speaker 5:  sheet, you can program that to the action button, which seems pretty neat.

949
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,880
Speaker 5:  And there, there's, you can run shortcuts with it. And I think there's one

950
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,240
Speaker 5:  more that I'm not remembering right now, but I could see like You know really

951
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,920
Speaker 5:  quickly, easily making a shortcut to launch Hali and then

952
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,980
Speaker 5:  using the action button to launch Hali as my camera. The

953
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,820
Speaker 5:  other thing you can do with it is you can take photos with it in the camera

954
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,220
Speaker 5:  app.

955
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,820
Speaker 6:  So I think the camera app launching is gonna be the thing that most people

956
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,740
Speaker 6:  use. Yeah. Because like, well,

957
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,900
Speaker 5:  To be clear, most people will use the default and they will not change it.

958
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,220
Speaker 4:  Yes. But if you do change the default, you

959
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,100
Speaker 5:  Are probably launching the camera

960
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,700
Speaker 6:  Are gonna change the default. Like I always, I know that you can just go

961
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,620
Speaker 6:  from the lock screen and go into your camera, but by the time I've done that,

962
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,500
Speaker 6:  my cat has moved. Yeah. The cute picture is gone. So,

963
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,260
Speaker 4:  I mean, well, I think the amount of time between that flow versus holding

964
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,100
Speaker 4:  the button down.

965
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,580
Speaker 5:  No, I think, I think it's, it's smoother to use the button. Like Allison

966
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,540
Speaker 5:  knows this with the Android phones for years, you double press the power

967
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,260
Speaker 5:  button to launch the camera and you're in it and you don't like, it's one

968
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,940
Speaker 5:  motion. You pull your phone up, you're double clicking. And, and you can

969
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,620
Speaker 5:  do that same thing with the action button, with the current system of,

970
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,100
Speaker 5:  you have to like wake the screen up, you have to put your finger on the screen,

971
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,460
Speaker 5:  which is almost always your other hand. And you have to hold it there for

972
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,820
Speaker 5:  a few seconds as it a second or whatever as it launches. That's like kind

973
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,100
Speaker 5:  of cumbersome and clumsy. I, I think the action button would be,

974
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,880
Speaker 7:  I have so much trouble with it. I don't know what is wrong with me, but like

975
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,720
Speaker 7:  swiping that camera icon is like, I'll, I'll like miss it or

976
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,280
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I don't know. I am jazzed about that action

977
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,600
Speaker 5:  Button. I always open the camera when I'm trying to swipe a notification

978
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,360
Speaker 5:  away, like just

979
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,160
Speaker 4:  Opening

980
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:39,440
Speaker 5:  The

981
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,200
Speaker 7:  Camera and drives me kind box. That's nice too. Yeah. And and the, the action

982
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,040
Speaker 7:  button, the camera, the like shortcut, you

983
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,000
Speaker 7:  can customize it to go into like a certain mode. So if you wanna

984
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,560
Speaker 7:  get in a portrait mode really quickly or a video, I think that's nice.

985
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,040
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

986
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,040
Speaker 5:  I think it just has more potential on the phone than I watch

987
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:00,000
Speaker 4:  In the UI for customizing this button is the funnest ui. It's wild that Apple

988
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,720
Speaker 4:  has shipped in a,

989
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,040
Speaker 5:  You go into the settings app, like just any other like thing you might change

990
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,040
Speaker 5:  on your iPhone and then you're taken into this like

991
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,160
Speaker 4:  There's a three render of the side of that we've never seen before,

992
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,960
Speaker 7:  Like turns and you see a different side of the phone. Yeah. It's

993
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,080
Speaker 4:  Wild.

994
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,120
Speaker 6:  I'm kind of mad as a watch user. This, this, this.

995
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,840
Speaker 7:  We're having more fun over here. Yeah. This

996
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,840
Speaker 4:  Boo. Yeah. Big ass screens. Huge battery gen. An impact action

997
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Speaker 4:  button. That's good. Okay. The day they bring whatcha doing retracing against

998
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,040
Speaker 4:  You got an iPhone 10 Strapp to your wrist.

999
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:34,280
Speaker 4:  Well why? I mean, I have the same, I have the exact same watch I,

1000
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,800
Speaker 4:  but the UI for this settings menu is so cool. Like Yeah, go look at our

1001
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,320
Speaker 4:  pictures. Go look at the videos. It's so cool. It's

1002
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,120
Speaker 5:  So just, it's cool but it's also just like so weird to go into.

1003
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,360
Speaker 5:  I love it. Like normal iOS.

1004
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And more iOS.

1005
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,240
Speaker 5:  It does not look like Apple's other us

1006
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,200
Speaker 4:  More iOS should be wacky. Yeah, sure. Like if they, they

1007
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,000
Speaker 4:  could do all of settings and all of settings would be fun. Instead of right

1008
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,960
Speaker 4:  now the sort of impenetrable list of radio buttons and toggles. That's the

1009
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,000
Speaker 5:  Nightmare. The nightmare of the settings

1010
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,600
Speaker 4:  App. Yeah. This is just like cool as hell and it's like fun to use and it

1011
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,320
Speaker 4:  makes you want to use it, which is neat. I am, I just don't know that

1012
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:15,000
Speaker 4:  Long Press. I think they should have had double tap and Long press.

1013
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,520
Speaker 5:  So this is the same argument that you made for with the Dynamic

1014
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,080
Speaker 5:  Island last year, right? Like they, they have a long press and they have

1015
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,080
Speaker 5:  like a short press and they

1016
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:24,960
Speaker 4:  Be

1017
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,200
Speaker 5:  Backwards. They invert, they should be backwards,

1018
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,640
Speaker 4:  Right? I'm no here I'm saying there's only Long Press, right? Well there

1019
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,440
Speaker 4:  is. So you tap it once, it'll just tell you what a long

1020
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,640
Speaker 5:  Press will be. Yeah. It'll give the status. It'll

1021
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,160
Speaker 4:  Pop up a thing that says like if it's in the default, if you tap it once,

1022
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,760
Speaker 4:  it says hold down for silent and then you tap it when it's in silence says,

1023
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,680
Speaker 4:  hold on for a ring. And it's like, okay, that's great. But

1024
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,160
Speaker 4:  so everything by the default is a long press in this button. I

1025
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,400
Speaker 5:  Think they're doing that because you could accidentally hit it. Oh

1026
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:48,840
Speaker 4:  Sure. That makes sense. And

1027
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,520
Speaker 5:  Then you don't wanna turn your ringer

1028
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,280
Speaker 4:  On actually. But I'm saying they should, they should have left ring at two

1029
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:56,240
Speaker 4:  clicks. So you double click it to switch ring modes

1030
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,120
Speaker 4:  and then you long press it and that's your custom action. That

1031
00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,600
Speaker 5:  Would be cool. Yeah.

1032
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:03,480
Speaker 4:  And I, I hope that comes, it just seems very, it seems very obvious they

1033
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,920
Speaker 4:  could do lots of things with this button. Yeah. Beyond just long pressing

1034
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,770
Speaker 4:  it. And I, I think the long press is gonna throw a lot of people off. 'cause

1035
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,890
Speaker 4:  you click it and it's like hold for ring and then your natural instinct is

1036
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,170
Speaker 4:  to push it again and it just says it again. Yeah.

1037
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,730
Speaker 5:  It gives you haptic feedback though. Like, it, it, it vibrates and it like

1038
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:23,530
Speaker 5:  buzzes as you're holding itself to kinda give you an indication of what

1039
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:23,810
Speaker 5:  it's doing.

1040
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,800
Speaker 7:  I think they did that 'cause they wanted to head off people being like, well

1041
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,760
Speaker 7:  how am I supposed to know if my phone's on mute? Yeah. I can just like reach

1042
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,600
Speaker 7:  into my pocket and mess with the mute switch or whatever. Or

1043
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,520
Speaker 5:  Or the people that insist they can feel when it's in mute Yeah. Without looking.

1044
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:39,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. What, yeah, there's people that can insist they could feel the mute

1045
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,400
Speaker 5:  switch. Yeah. So

1046
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:40,520
Speaker 7:  You,

1047
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,480
Speaker 5:  Which position is' in

1048
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,240
Speaker 7:  Push it once and you're like a bullshit.

1049
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:45,360
Speaker 5:  Sorry. Yeah.

1050
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,000
Speaker 4:  I just don't, well it, it also just occurs to me that if anybody with an

1051
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,880
Speaker 4:  Apple watch like does not need the mute switch anymore because if, unless

1052
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,320
Speaker 4:  you're a sociopath, your phone should always be on mute because your, your

1053
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,880
Speaker 4:  watch is buzzing you and you're fine. Right. Like,

1054
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,440
Speaker 4:  you're probably fine. So we'll see. I'm, I'm excited about it. I'm excited

1055
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,200
Speaker 4:  about the camera stuff. I think the, the shortcuts people are gonna make

1056
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,480
Speaker 4:  for this are gonna be bananas. I hope somebody that does like an iPhone action

1057
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,680
Speaker 4:  button shortcuts website with all the best ones there already. Already some

1058
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,240
Speaker 4:  do that. There are already some cool shortcuts out there. But yeah, I, it

1059
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:19,040
Speaker 4:  it's a, it's a good change along with u s pc. I think the action buttons

1060
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,640
Speaker 4:  like a good change to the phone. Okay. Then there's the camera,

1061
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:27,200
Speaker 4:  which seems all new kind of bananas, Allison and go through it.

1062
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So they're saying that the main camera is 48

1063
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:34,400
Speaker 7:  megapixels again, but they're saying it's a bigger sensor.

1064
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,360
Speaker 7:  And then You know you have the Ultra wide, which had some like new

1065
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,120
Speaker 7:  coatings or something. But the big story is the five times

1066
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,080
Speaker 7:  telephoto lens, which they would not, they did not say

1067
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:49,920
Speaker 7:  periscope. They have a word for tetra prism.

1068
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,080
Speaker 7:  I, I don't know. Yeah. There's, there's some mirrors and things

1069
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:58,000
Speaker 7:  happening inside there, but you don't get the three times, you get the five

1070
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,640
Speaker 7:  times. Instead it's got kind of some kind of sensor

1071
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,840
Speaker 7:  shift stabilization along with the optical stabilization, which

1072
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,800
Speaker 7:  is a good thing. You know, assuming it works, but Yeah. And they're all about

1073
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:13,640
Speaker 7:  these like seven different lenses that you get with it. And that's

1074
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,840
Speaker 7:  counting You know macro and the Ultra wide and

1075
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:21,800
Speaker 7:  the, the crop modes you can do. But there's like a new thing

1076
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,600
Speaker 7:  where you can push the like main camera icon and it'll switch

1077
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,280
Speaker 7:  between like, like equivalent focal legs, like 24

1078
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,520
Speaker 7:  millimeters, 35 millimeters. Yeah. Which

1079
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,040
Speaker 5:  I think is great. Yeah. Right. I'm, I'm excited for that because

1080
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:34,800
Speaker 4:  I, I just think

1081
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,600
Speaker 5:  That the main camera is too wide. I've long felt like the main camera is

1082
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,960
Speaker 5:  like equivalent to like 24 or 26 millimeters for a few years now. And it's

1083
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,160
Speaker 5:  too wide. Like I don't like it that wide. I like to shoot it like 30 or 35

1084
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,520
Speaker 5:  and now I can just like tell, it

1085
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,560
Speaker 4:  Can set it by default, which is cool. Can

1086
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,360
Speaker 5:  Set it by default. It's gonna like crop in the sensor. It's, it's

1087
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,440
Speaker 4:  Really unclear how this is working. Is it cropping the sensor? Because

1088
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,520
Speaker 5:  I think it's using the same technology as the two x. It's just cutting into

1089
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,200
Speaker 5:  the sensor at that to, to approximate that field of view.

1090
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,080
Speaker 5:  And then it will produce a 24 or 12 megapixel image out, the

1091
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,440
Speaker 4:  Exact word that we were told was there's some other voodoo going on. Yes.

1092
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:13,320
Speaker 4:  Oh, voodoo. 'cause they, the claim is that it will force shorten the way

1093
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,840
Speaker 4:  that those different focal lengths will. Yeah. Which is again, impossible

1094
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,560
Speaker 4:  to see on an iPhone in that environment, which is a totally

1095
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:25,120
Speaker 4:  crazy environment with perfect light. So I'm very curious as we review this

1096
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,840
Speaker 4:  thing to see if those modes actually foreshorten the way that a

1097
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,400
Speaker 4:  proper focal length would, I suspect that they do not.

1098
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,400
Speaker 4:  But you should be able to tell the difference between 24 to 35.

1099
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,400
Speaker 5:  Yes. It's very obvious as you go down the, the numbers of equivalent

1100
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:44,120
Speaker 5:  focal lengths, the, the smaller they are, the more you notice each

1101
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,440
Speaker 5:  millimeter's difference. So when you are going from 24 to 28, it's actually

1102
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,000
Speaker 5:  a visible noticeable difference. If you're going from a hundred to 104,

1103
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:55,200
Speaker 5:  you don't notice that difference. It's too, too minute. But when you, you,

1104
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,880
Speaker 5:  you can see it punching in 24, 28, 35. Yeah.

1105
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,240
Speaker 5:  And then I think the Ultra wide is like a 13 or something like that.

1106
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:06,400
Speaker 4:  It's, yeah. And so the range is 13 to one 20 now. Yes. It's cool. Again,

1107
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:10,360
Speaker 4:  impossible to tell you what these cameras are actually like. Like it's just

1108
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,840
Speaker 4:  a bonkers environment. They were, they took photos and they didn't, they

1109
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,480
Speaker 4:  didn't explode. Yeah. Like that's as much as it got right now. But it's,

1110
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,440
Speaker 4:  I think that stuff is cool. Dan, you have some

1111
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,760
Speaker 4:  qualms about the telephoto.

1112
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,960
Speaker 5:  I don't, I'm not confident that the telephoto is gonna be all that great.

1113
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,880
Speaker 5:  I think it's great that it gives a longer reach. Like that was needed. The

1114
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,120
Speaker 5:  three x telephoto and prior pro models existed.

1115
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:37,480
Speaker 5:  Never was really that great. I know a lot of people never use it because

1116
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,520
Speaker 5:  they don't like the quality out of it. And it also doesn't bring you that

1117
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,040
Speaker 5:  much closer. Five x does bring you noticeably closer. That one 20

1118
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,920
Speaker 5:  millimeter focal length is noticeably closer. But it's not super long. Like

1119
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,640
Speaker 5:  today for the live blog I was shooting with an 18 to 300 millimeter lens

1120
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,360
Speaker 5:  on my camera. So like there's a lot further to go.

1121
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,400
Speaker 5:  Samsung's 10 x zoom is much further than the five x that you get on the

1122
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,280
Speaker 5:  pro now. But in order to make this work and because of physics, they

1123
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,960
Speaker 5:  have to put a small sensor in there. And Samsung has the same problem with

1124
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:10,400
Speaker 5:  its cameras. The other manufacturers that have done Periscope or not Periscope

1125
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,760
Speaker 5:  cameras in the past have the same problem where they have to put a small

1126
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,920
Speaker 5:  sensor in there in order to get the physics to work right. To get the light

1127
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,720
Speaker 5:  exposed. And you can tell like pretty easily the

1128
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,680
Speaker 5:  quality difference even in the demo area, perfect lighting, all

1129
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,480
Speaker 5:  this stuff. I took a photo of some folks across the table and I

1130
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,640
Speaker 5:  zoom in and like I look at the details in the hair. It's all kind of blurred

1131
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,080
Speaker 5:  and mushed together. It's noisy stuff like that. Allison is gonna do a ton

1132
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,400
Speaker 5:  more testing. We'll get a more formal verdict on it. I'm just skeptical.

1133
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:42,280
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You know. I, I don't, I think the five x is gonna be there

1134
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,520
Speaker 5:  and it, it'll be useful to some people, especially the folks like I said

1135
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,560
Speaker 5:  earlier who are standing there pinch zooming on their phone to get as close

1136
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,400
Speaker 5:  as they possibly can. It's better to have a five x optical

1137
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,960
Speaker 5:  starting point then a three x. But I don't think it's going to be

1138
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:59,120
Speaker 5:  like, I think a lot of people are still gonna fall back to the main camera

1139
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,360
Speaker 5:  if they care about the image quality.

1140
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:04,680
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I shooted two x a lot with my 14 pro, like I never go to three.

1141
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,440
Speaker 5:  And I think that the, the five, the five x existence Allison you were saying

1142
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,680
Speaker 5:  earlier, didn't really make sense to have that two x punch in when you have

1143
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,160
Speaker 5:  a three x it's not enough difference now. I think it gives more of a reason

1144
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,960
Speaker 5:  for that two x punch in to exist because five x is like, if I, if I'm, I'm

1145
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,600
Speaker 5:  sitting across from a small table from uni life, I use five x I'm like taking

1146
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,160
Speaker 5:  pictures of of your eyeballs. Yeah. And, and your nose. But like two x I

1147
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,520
Speaker 5:  can frame you nicely. So I, I think that gives more of that punch in to reason

1148
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,000
Speaker 5:  to exist.

1149
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Allison, what do you think?

1150
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,640
Speaker 7:  I am interested to try it out. I like the five x like is

1151
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,320
Speaker 7:  sort of when I use like the Pixel seven Pro has one and

1152
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,800
Speaker 7:  I find it useful in these like fringe cases where I'm on a hike and

1153
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,480
Speaker 7:  I'm trying to frame something and like three x just gets you nothing.

1154
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:46,320
Speaker 7:  You're

1155
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,000
Speaker 5:  You're in the far away section of the Taylor Swift concert. Yeah.

1156
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,000
Speaker 7:  Right. You're, you're in the back row. But five x is like that much closer

1157
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:58,120
Speaker 7:  and it is an actual meaningful difference. So I'm interested to

1158
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:58,960
Speaker 7:  see what it looks like.

1159
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,600
Speaker 5:  The question is, is this good enough to get the pro Max? Because I don't

1160
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,400
Speaker 5:  think we've actually stated that this is only on the Pro Max. That's true.

1161
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's not on the pro, the pro gets the same three x as last year. So

1162
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,320
Speaker 5:  like is this five x a meaningful enough jump to get the bigger, more

1163
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,080
Speaker 5:  expensive phone, which we can talk about is also more expensive the last

1164
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,880
Speaker 5:  year. But for me, based on what I saw so far, I would say no,

1165
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,480
Speaker 5:  I I'm I'm, I'm not gonna make use of that camera often enough and I'd rather

1166
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,400
Speaker 5:  have a smaller lighter phone.

1167
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But I look, I love a big screen and big battery. You love a

1168
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,400
Speaker 5:  That screen

1169
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,320
Speaker 4:  You're different and a big battery. We're we're different people

1170
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:32,800
Speaker 4:  like the Yeah, the camera is not the thing. It's the bigger screen and the

1171
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,440
Speaker 4:  bigger battery. I don't think anybody is gonna buy this thing for the Zoom

1172
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,880
Speaker 4:  lens. I think if it was

1173
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:40,560
Speaker 5:  Good enough, people would, I mean this is not the first time we've seen Apple

1174
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,720
Speaker 5:  segregate the camera to the pro. The biggest phone they did with the 12 Pro.

1175
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,640
Speaker 5:  Right. The 12 Pro and pro Max. The 12 Pro had the first time it had the

1176
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,160
Speaker 5:  really bigger sensor for the main one and the pro, the regular pro one did

1177
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,320
Speaker 5:  not. And there was a noticeable difference between the two if you cared enough

1178
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:57,320
Speaker 5:  about that. And so we'll

1179
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,120
Speaker 4:  See. I dunno, there's some video stuff here. They now support

1180
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:04,920
Speaker 4:  four K 60 logging coding. When you shoot in

1181
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:08,840
Speaker 4:  ProRes they ACEs, which is an industry standard for color grading.

1182
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:13,080
Speaker 4:  All very good. Cool. It's it's the stuff, it's the pro. It's the most pro

1183
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,840
Speaker 4:  phone ever Dan. And then this is I think, fascinating.

1184
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,760
Speaker 4:  They support spatial video capture. If you turn the phone sideways

1185
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:25,120
Speaker 4:  and you use the Maine and the Ultra wide, it'll do spatial great. It's for

1186
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,040
Speaker 4:  the Vision pro. You're the divorce dad watching a birthday party.

1187
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:33,360
Speaker 4:  No, this is what it's for. It's happening. It's notable

1188
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:37,280
Speaker 5:  That in the demo clip that they showed on stage, it was not a divorce

1189
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,720
Speaker 4:  Dad watching it. They did not show the dad

1190
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,080
Speaker 4:  interacting with his kids through

1191
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:48,240
Speaker 5:  The face mask. It was You know another person reliving a memory

1192
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,480
Speaker 5:  on their couch.

1193
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Alone in a headset alone. There's no way to

1194
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,920
Speaker 4:  avoid it. You're wearing this headset,

1195
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,200
Speaker 5:  You only experience it

1196
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,160
Speaker 4:  Alone. Here's what I'll say philosophically, this is fascinating to me. We

1197
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,880
Speaker 4:  have been writing about this for a long time. James Baram, our old creative

1198
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,560
Speaker 4:  director, has a piece on our site from ages ago. He's like the power of the

1199
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,920
Speaker 4:  iPhone. It is the first device where the people

1200
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:13,760
Speaker 4:  consuming the photos are using the same device as the people

1201
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,680
Speaker 4:  making the photos. And so your relationship with photography has changed.

1202
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:21,560
Speaker 4:  And we published this eight years ago, this piece like, and

1203
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,520
Speaker 4:  James was a pro photographer before. You like big thinky, we'll link it.

1204
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:28,240
Speaker 4:  It's a great piece. I've been thinking about the piece a lot. Every time

1205
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,200
Speaker 4:  we do an iPhone interview, like this is the dynamic is there's there, I

1206
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,040
Speaker 4:  cannot think of another creative tool actually where it is both the thing

1207
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,800
Speaker 4:  that makes the content and the thing that consumes the content. Then you

1208
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,640
Speaker 4:  have a relationship with the person on the other end of the the the platform.

1209
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,440
Speaker 4:  Right. This is the first time Apple's broken that relationship

1210
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,960
Speaker 4:  where you can shoot spatial video on your iPhone

1211
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:52,490
Speaker 4:  and you cannot watch it.

1212
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:55,770
Speaker 5:  See they could have put, cannot put a three D screen on it. Yeah. It

1213
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:58,250
Speaker 4:  We an old school, one of those You grateful the red

1214
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,530
Speaker 7:  Phone got tro we've got three d

1215
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,250
Speaker 5:  It's all coming. It's all the greatest hits.

1216
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:04,130
Speaker 4:  Red and red and blue glasses.

1217
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:09,650
Speaker 4:  The, I don't think they should put a three D screen on this. They should

1218
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,930
Speaker 4:  have done it like the fire phone with like 500 cameras around the screen.

1219
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:16,290
Speaker 4:  I just, there's just something fascinating about that. Yeah. That for

1220
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:20,090
Speaker 4:  the first time ever, the iPhone is a capture device for another system

1221
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:24,530
Speaker 4:  that nobody has yet that's super expensive that no one knows what it's for.

1222
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:28,050
Speaker 4:  And yeah, it sure they should do it, but it's cool they

1223
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,010
Speaker 5:  Do it well. They, they they have to do it because otherwise the only way

1224
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:33,890
Speaker 5:  to capture this spatial video is through the headset, which is like,

1225
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,490
Speaker 5:  we, we just kind of talked about how awkward that can be stupid. So I mean

1226
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,850
Speaker 5:  we'll see what it's like to actually view spatial video on the

1227
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,010
Speaker 5:  iPhone. I'm sure what I

1228
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,410
Speaker 4:  Expect expect is I'm, it's just gonna be the main camera. It

1229
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:45,490
Speaker 5:  Just falls back to the main camera. Right. It's

1230
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,210
Speaker 4:  Between the main camera, it's normal video, then you've got a depth map.

1231
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,090
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All that stuff. Yeah.

1232
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,530
Speaker 5:  And that's what the second camera's doing is creating the depth map. It's

1233
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:54,370
Speaker 5:  got the distance between the lenses to do so notable that you have to turn

1234
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:57,650
Speaker 5:  it in landscape mode to do so. That makes sense. Which makes sense from a

1235
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,930
Speaker 5:  technical level. It does not make sense for how 99% of people shoot video

1236
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:01,210
Speaker 5:  on

1237
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,930
Speaker 4:  Their phone. You know portrait headset video is not a good idea.

1238
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:05,330
Speaker 5:  I'm just saying

1239
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,170
Speaker 4:  This is how people

1240
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:08,970
Speaker 5:  Shoot video on their phones. Yeah. Right. And so like they can switch to

1241
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,410
Speaker 5:  that mode. Maybe the phone will have a UI telling them, turn the phone to

1242
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:15,850
Speaker 5:  the side to do this. But if it doesn't, they're gonna have a lot of like

1243
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:20,130
Speaker 5:  weird videos. But like, they had to do it in order to get any content for

1244
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:22,490
Speaker 5:  the headset down the road. Right. We'll,

1245
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:26,410
Speaker 4:  We'll see. I'm just saying it's the first time Apple's broken this

1246
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:29,610
Speaker 4:  sort of power of the iPhone as a camera in that way.

1247
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,650
Speaker 4:  Okay. We'll see how it goes. Kind of what they're assuming is that people

1248
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,730
Speaker 4:  will shoot spatial video without a headset.

1249
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,090
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Because they will be buying an iPhone in a week and a half. Right.

1250
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:41,530
Speaker 5:  And and not have a headset for they and

1251
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,010
Speaker 4:  Not have a headset. Six plus. So they did say it's coming later, but even

1252
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,970
Speaker 4:  then the iPhone Pro installed base, the iPhone 15 pro

1253
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:51,330
Speaker 4:  installed base FM 15 pro install base necessarily will dwarf the headset

1254
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,290
Speaker 4:  install base for a long time. So I'm just wondering, like,

1255
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,170
Speaker 4:  there's just something in there. It's, there's something important about

1256
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,850
Speaker 4:  this camera and what it represents to people that is broken by the ability

1257
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:07,330
Speaker 4:  to shoot spatial video. And it's not a technical thing, it's not a quality

1258
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:10,490
Speaker 4:  thing. It is like a philosophical relationship

1259
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,450
Speaker 4:  between the camera and the screen on the iPhone that Apple has

1260
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,330
Speaker 4:  for the first time divorced.

1261
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:21,200
Speaker 7:  It's the it's the aspirational thing. Yeah. They're like, you could

1262
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,600
Speaker 7:  buy a vision pro, you can, you can record this video. You'll be ready for

1263
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,320
Speaker 7:  it. Yeah, yeah. Like, probably won't.

1264
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But it's like, what's a good analog

1265
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:33,480
Speaker 4:  analogy? It's like if you bought a V H S camcorder, but you didn't have a

1266
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,400
Speaker 4:  V H Ss player in your house. Yeah. Right. It's just like

1267
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,440
Speaker 4:  a totally weird thing. Mm. I think it's fascinating. Like I just,

1268
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,000
Speaker 4:  I just like thinking about it, like what that represents for this device.

1269
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:48,960
Speaker 4:  Because I think a lot of it's the thing about the tos, how to get,

1270
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:53,000
Speaker 4:  how to take better videos in camp photos in your iPhone. Like everybody

1271
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:56,720
Speaker 4:  has an idea about it. And there's a cottage industry of content creators

1272
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,520
Speaker 4:  who are like, here's what you do. You turn your phone upside down, you count

1273
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,920
Speaker 4:  to 20, you throw it in the ocean and it's like whatever. Right. And it's

1274
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,360
Speaker 4:  because they're like, you, you look at this photo, I will teach you how to

1275
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,960
Speaker 4:  make it using the tool that you're holding in your hand. And this, I'm just

1276
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,520
Speaker 4:  telling you this, breaks it in a way that I think is utterly fascinating.

1277
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:18,110
Speaker 4:  And I, I'm just like waiting for the day when someone realized

1278
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:22,070
Speaker 4:  they've shot like oceans of spatial video

1279
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,390
Speaker 4:  and they're, and they're like, what is this for You know.

1280
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:29,310
Speaker 5:  I mean, I think the people that will use it and know what it is are the people

1281
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,630
Speaker 5:  that are going to be the first ones to buy a vision pro when it comes out.

1282
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:36,630
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like most people, we're not gonna touch it. They're not gonna go

1283
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:37,630
Speaker 5:  into the mode. They're not gonna

1284
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:39,750
Speaker 4:  Enable it. You know, like, just, just walk through that. You're like walking

1285
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,670
Speaker 4:  down the street beautiful San Francisco, like taking a

1286
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,510
Speaker 4:  photo of the bay, the bridge, the whole thing. And you're like, I can't wait

1287
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:50,430
Speaker 4:  to go put on my headset and like relive. It's like

1288
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,950
Speaker 4:  there's just something. I promise you there's something weird there.

1289
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,910
Speaker 5:  Divorce stats are gonna love it.

1290
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:59,430
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We'll link that piece by James. It, I, I was thinking about it during

1291
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:03,190
Speaker 4:  this entire demo of just how important it is that a lot of times

1292
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:06,510
Speaker 4:  when you look at a photo on your iPhone, you're holding the same thing that

1293
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:10,190
Speaker 4:  someone was holding to take that photo. And there's just something very

1294
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:14,110
Speaker 4:  important about that. And it's all the

1295
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:18,030
Speaker 4:  spatial computing tangent that Apple's going down is about to make all

1296
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:21,670
Speaker 4:  that way weirder. Yeah. All right. I think that's enough for the Oh, the

1297
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:22,510
Speaker 4:  mystery. The big the

1298
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,030
Speaker 5:  The whole reason the whole thing.

1299
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:27,550
Speaker 4:  The only thing I want to talk about, okay. The app has wifi six E, which

1300
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,750
Speaker 4:  is cool. Sure. 'cause I just bought the wrong heroes. But now they're the

1301
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,230
Speaker 4:  right heroes.

1302
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:36,030
Speaker 4:  I was, I should have bought the pro sixes. Should you have. Yeah. 'cause

1303
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:36,590
Speaker 4:  they, they have the,

1304
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:37,470
Speaker 5:  That's a whole nother podcast,

1305
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:41,790
Speaker 4:  Whatever. But I accidentally bought the six E's. Yeah. Which have the six

1306
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:44,230
Speaker 4:  E radios in them. But I have no six E devices because they

1307
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:45,750
Speaker 5:  Use the six E radio to talk to each other.

1308
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:49,670
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But six gig cards sucks for that. So whatever, it doesn't matter. Now

1309
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:53,150
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna get an iPhone with six E I'm gonna get the full mega full

1310
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:56,750
Speaker 5:  Gigabit. Lemme tell. You'll never know when it's on six E because it's not

1311
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,030
Speaker 5:  gonna tell you it's impossible

1312
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:00,470
Speaker 4:  To force it full gigabit. We're gonna, I'm gonna be downloading movies so

1313
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:03,430
Speaker 4:  fast. The phone explodes, this's gonna be great. But then they also tucked

1314
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:07,190
Speaker 4:  into this press release tucked into the feature Bento box says, plus

1315
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:10,990
Speaker 4:  Thread is a Thread radio. Now if you have been following

1316
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,800
Speaker 4:  Gen two E at The Verge You know that Thread is an important part of the

1317
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,200
Speaker 4:  future of the smart home. Which Jen has a British accent. She always goes

1318
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,240
Speaker 4:  with the smart home, which is great

1319
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:24,040
Speaker 4:  Thread and Matter coexist.

1320
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:27,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well so Thread is one of the technologies that Matter runs on. Is is.

1321
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,200
Speaker 4:  Right. But Matter can run anything. But the idea is that you'll have this

1322
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:34,000
Speaker 4:  secondary wireless network in New York Smart Home that is Thread.

1323
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:36,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And it's a mesh network between all your devices. You know a border

1324
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,880
Speaker 4:  router that connects 'em to the wifi and the internet, whatever. Why is there

1325
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,560
Speaker 4:  a Thread radio in the iPhone by the way? None of that works in it is just

1326
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:47,240
Speaker 4:  a mess. Yeah. Just a disaster mess. None of it quite works. None of it. Quite

1327
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,080
Speaker 4:  interoperates. If you buy like one nano leaf light bulb and

1328
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,960
Speaker 4:  connect it to a home pod mini with a series of incantations

1329
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:58,800
Speaker 4:  and like crystals, it's a little bit faster than doing for

1330
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:02,680
Speaker 4:  wifi. And that's about as good as it gets. But the iPhone 15

1331
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,760
Speaker 4:  Pro has a Thread radio in it. Yeah. And the press release is like,

1332
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:10,240
Speaker 4:  it's there for future ideas in the home app. And

1333
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,680
Speaker 4:  you're like, what are those ideas? And everyone's like, we don't know yet.

1334
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,920
Speaker 4:  And that's the whole answer. They're like, yeah, some stuff is gonna happen

1335
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,480
Speaker 4:  with Matter. And it's like, what Stuff? Like who knows? Yeah.

1336
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,440
Speaker 5:  I, I've been trying to think about like what you would do with a Thread radio

1337
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,400
Speaker 5:  on a phone that I can't do with a wifi or Bluetooth radio order.

1338
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:26,720
Speaker 5:  You're

1339
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,680
Speaker 4:  Gonna let up that ran leaf light bulbs so fast. You're gonna, you're gonna,

1340
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,200
Speaker 4:  you're gonna think it, it's gonna light up. So,

1341
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:35,080
Speaker 5:  So let's, let's let's think this through. You have Thread Radio on your iPhone

1342
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:36,440
Speaker 5:  and you

1343
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,800
Speaker 4:  No. Step one, the Connectivity Standards Alliance

1344
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,600
Speaker 4:  finishes the matter. Specification

1345
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:47,080
Speaker 5:  Matter accepted. You have Thread on your iPhone and you

1346
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,720
Speaker 5:  have a Thread device and it uses Thread to talk to that device to communicate

1347
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,040
Speaker 5:  to it. Yeah. What happens when you leave your house and someone else wants

1348
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,000
Speaker 5:  to control that device? Do they need Thread

1349
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,880
Speaker 4:  On their No, because they, you'll have some border router in your house.

1350
01:09:58,980 --> 01:09:59,280
Speaker 4:  So why do

1351
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,320
Speaker 5:  I need Thread on my

1352
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,560
Speaker 4:  Phone? This is why I started. That's what I'm saying with the connectivity

1353
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:06,680
Speaker 4:  Standards Alliance finishes the matter specification which includes

1354
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:10,200
Speaker 4:  Thread radio interoperability. Yeah.

1355
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,800
Speaker 5:  Thread, well technically Thread network interoperability. Yeah. It gets so

1356
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,280
Speaker 5:  much woner.

1357
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,720
Speaker 4:  Right. So right now my, my new heroes have Thread radios in them. Yeah. But

1358
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,200
Speaker 4:  those, and they should make a mesh network with,

1359
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,000
Speaker 5:  With your home pods. But they do not. They do not. They do not talk. So now

1360
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,120
Speaker 5:  I

1361
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,560
Speaker 4:  Have two Thread networks in

1362
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,360
Speaker 5:  The house. Yes, yes. And if you introduce a Google hub Max three, which I

1363
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:28,960
Speaker 5:  think you have.

1364
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:31,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. No I don't have, we have, we have the baby ones. Okay. So

1365
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:31,800
Speaker 5:  Those

1366
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:32,960
Speaker 4:  I don't think they

1367
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,800
Speaker 5:  Do. No. But a hub Max would introduce yet another Thread network

1368
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:37,280
Speaker 5:  in your

1369
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,960
Speaker 4:  House and none of, and all of those are supposed to make one giant happy

1370
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,000
Speaker 4:  Thread mesh network. And then you bring the iPhone into

1371
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,880
Speaker 4:  it and it sees that happy Thread mesh network and it can connect

1372
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,880
Speaker 4:  directly to devices on it. This is the dream. Now Thread, I just don't

1373
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:55,120
Speaker 4:  why Thread Now what is gonna happen is that home kit is also

1374
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:59,520
Speaker 4:  insanity and something on your home kit Thread network will break

1375
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:03,720
Speaker 4:  and the solution to fixing it will be restarting your iPhone, which is

1376
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,440
Speaker 4:  often a solution

1377
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:08,560
Speaker 5:  Kit. Which is, yeah. I mean that is the default home kit fix. 'cause

1378
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,680
Speaker 5:  you never 'cause Home Kit does not tell you what breaks or how it broke or

1379
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:15,400
Speaker 5:  why the answer is reboot your iPhone. And it weirdly fixes,

1380
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:19,840
Speaker 5:  I've run a Thread network in my home for a couple years now. And frequently

1381
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:23,840
Speaker 5:  if like say I move a home pod to a different room or I decide we don't need

1382
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:24,920
Speaker 5:  to use it anymore.

1383
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:27,840
Speaker 4:  Devices screwing with this family will just

1384
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:31,800
Speaker 5:  Stop working. Yeah. And so like light bulbs will just no longer connect.

1385
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,080
Speaker 5:  And they're supposed supposed to be self-healing and all that doesn't do

1386
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,680
Speaker 5:  that. This is the first time I've been just like taking them out when they

1387
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,960
Speaker 5:  stop working, replacing

1388
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,680
Speaker 4:  Them with I three kids. You're just like, they'll never know what's going

1389
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:40,840
Speaker 4:  on.

1390
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,840
Speaker 5:  I'm away, I'm away from home this week. And I'm convinced nothing in the

1391
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,280
Speaker 5:  house works. They're just sitting in the dark.

1392
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,080
Speaker 4:  They're

1393
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,600
Speaker 5:  Sitting in the dark or they're like sleeping with all the lights on.

1394
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:55,360
Speaker 4:  Like they're cutting the main power of the house. Go bed. I just think it's,

1395
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,160
Speaker 4:  this is the first time the Ultra wide band ship. The first time they shipped

1396
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,880
Speaker 4:  in a pro was the, I think the first time they put in a thing that they

1397
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,640
Speaker 4:  hadn't quite enabled all the use cases for by the way. Both I found. But

1398
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:05,720
Speaker 4:  they

1399
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,840
Speaker 5:  Had some use cases for that.

1400
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,000
Speaker 4:  Not yet. Didn't they? Not yet. They they, they announced it with like car

1401
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,320
Speaker 4:  keys and they

1402
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:12,920
Speaker 5:  Were hoping car

1403
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,840
Speaker 4:  Keys would happen and it never happened. Yeah. And they, they kind of just

1404
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:15,120
Speaker 4:  got

1405
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,320
Speaker 5:  But fire. But then they fire tag, they came out with a but that

1406
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,520
Speaker 4:  Was next first they first they did the chip. That was the only time I can

1407
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,120
Speaker 4:  really think this, by the way, these have new Ultra wideband chips. Yes.

1408
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:24,840
Speaker 5:  That enabled

1409
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,040
Speaker 4:  Precision finding with morphs.

1410
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:27,240
Speaker 5:  We could call them U two chips.

1411
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:29,960
Speaker 4:  Apple doesn't like it when you do that.

1412
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,680
Speaker 5:  No, but, but I'm gonna do it.

1413
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,240
Speaker 4:  They, they kept saying sec second generation Ultra rod band chips. So I was

1414
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:35,400
Speaker 4:  like, listen,

1415
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,560
Speaker 5:  They called it the U one.

1416
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:37,960
Speaker 4:  They're

1417
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,520
Speaker 5:  Not, it wasn't me that called it the U one,

1418
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,680
Speaker 4:  But that's the only time I think this, this time they, they're putting a

1419
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,280
Speaker 4:  Thread radio. I'm assuming it's coming for the ride with the wifi

1420
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,400
Speaker 4:  six e chip that they're using.

1421
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,040
Speaker 5:  That's probably a safe bet.

1422
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,360
Speaker 4:  Right. And so they just have it. They might as well do it and they don't

1423
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,040
Speaker 4:  know what it's for. And like something good will happen. I just,

1424
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,800
Speaker 5:  I someone who has an idea of what to use the Thread radio on an I for

1425
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,080
Speaker 4:  It has

1426
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,760
Speaker 5:  To be that it's right into the show. And tell me it that

1427
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:03,520
Speaker 4:  Again, it has to be that what you want is a direct connection to that nano

1428
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,180
Speaker 4:  leaf bulb or whatever other Thread device. You're laughing.

1429
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,180
Speaker 4:  This is all people wanna do. I'm

1430
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:09,220
Speaker 5:  Trying,

1431
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:11,580
Speaker 4:  We're going from red to blue, like switch

1432
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,780
Speaker 6:  It. I'm just, I'm just thinking of the nano leaf bulb talking to the little

1433
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,700
Speaker 6:  iPhone radio. It's, it's just a, it's a cute little thing in my head. Right.

1434
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,220
Speaker 6:  That's all it is.

1435
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:22,220
Speaker 5:  I just, I just don't see a scenario where that would ever happen. Because

1436
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:24,180
Speaker 5:  for the nano leaf bulb to be running

1437
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,140
Speaker 4:  On Thread, it's connected to a Thread network in your house. Exactly. That

1438
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,620
Speaker 4:  you're on the same wifi with. Exactly.

1439
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,340
Speaker 6:  I have so much respect for Jen. 'cause my head hurts.

1440
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:35,100
Speaker 4:  It's not great. Jen, Jen wrote an entire piece that's basically like, what

1441
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,500
Speaker 4:  is this? Why is this here? And it just like runs through the options. She's

1442
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,460
Speaker 5:  Wrote this multiple times out. We have what is matter? What is Thread? Yeah.

1443
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,340
Speaker 5:  What is all No,

1444
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,140
Speaker 4:  But with this one in particular, it's like this phone has this chip in it.

1445
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,140
Speaker 4:  Why? And she just like runs down the options. And then by the end of the

1446
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:51,780
Speaker 4:  piece she's like, none of these are good ideas. Like,

1447
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:55,420
Speaker 4:  none this, none of this makes any sense. I'm just dying to know

1448
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:58,540
Speaker 4:  what, what Apple obviously has a plan, right? Yeah. They wouldn't,

1449
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,900
Speaker 5:  They just don't wanna tell us yet. Apple

1450
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:03,500
Speaker 4:  Often puts stuff in their devices and doesn't even mention it.

1451
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:07,220
Speaker 4:  Even when the tear downs reveal that it's there, whatever, until they're

1452
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:11,060
Speaker 4:  ready to light it up. And here they put it on the slide and in the

1453
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,520
Speaker 4:  press release there has to be some plan.

1454
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,920
Speaker 4:  I just cannot figure out what it's like. Not even a hypothesis that

1455
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:22,760
Speaker 4:  begins to make sense outside of Dan's kids need to light up

1456
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,720
Speaker 4:  their Nana leaf bulbs even faster than they were doing before. That's it.

1457
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:30,040
Speaker 4:  That's what I got. We're doing an entire hour with Jen on the Thread radio

1458
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:30,960
Speaker 4:  and the 15 Pro.

1459
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,280
Speaker 6:  I am so bewildered by all of that. I can't, my head hurts. Yeah. So bad.

1460
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,000
Speaker 4:  So We just moved. So like I'm buying all this stuff and it's like, this is

1461
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,840
Speaker 4:  the worst time to buy smart home stuff. Like all of it is inherently

1462
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,360
Speaker 4:  obsolete right now.

1463
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:46,200
Speaker 5:  No. So the move is you buy stuff that is supported by a hub because the hub

1464
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,760
Speaker 5:  will get upgraded and then all the devices that connect to that hub will

1465
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:52,840
Speaker 5:  carry along with it. It's the individual devices that are a nightmare.

1466
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:56,640
Speaker 6:  This explains why I have like five hue bulbs just sitting

1467
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,240
Speaker 6:  in a, sitting in a box. Because once I knew, but

1468
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,640
Speaker 5:  You works on a hub and it's also bulletproof for lizza. No,

1469
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:05,680
Speaker 6:  No, no. The hub does not work in my house because the router is in a closet.

1470
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:09,800
Speaker 6:  So I was like, You know, I will eventually move and then I will unpack

1471
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,920
Speaker 6:  these five bulbs for some future time.

1472
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:16,240
Speaker 4:  I'm saying if, if we end up with door locks or require external hub like

1473
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:20,080
Speaker 4:  that something bad has happened in my life. Right. Like

1474
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:23,640
Speaker 4:  that's a real issue. I don't think that's gonna happen. I'm just saying

1475
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:27,400
Speaker 4:  basically you're ready for the next two years of The Vergecast to be

1476
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,440
Speaker 4:  nightmare Smart Home integration stories. You

1477
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,800
Speaker 5:  Like complaining about the smart home? Yes. Because

1478
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:33,040
Speaker 4:  It's just, it's so not ready.

1479
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:35,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it, it feels like it's gotten worse

1480
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,960
Speaker 4:  But the iPhone 15 Pro is mysteriously ready

1481
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:42,160
Speaker 4:  because it has a Thread radio in it. And I don't know why

1482
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:43,400
Speaker 5:  It's matter ready? If

1483
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,040
Speaker 4:  You know why, let me know something will happen. Yeah.

1484
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,680
Speaker 5:  If you've got an interesting idea, let us

1485
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,480
Speaker 4:  Know. All right. We gotta take a break and be asked to complain about the

1486
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,360
Speaker 4:  watches. We'll be right back.

1487
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:03,300
Speaker 13:  Wait, are you gaming on a Chromebook?

1488
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:07,380
Speaker 14:  Yeah, it's got a high res 120 hertz display plus this

1489
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,980
Speaker 14:  killer R G B keyboard. And I can access thousands of games anytime,

1490
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:11,820
Speaker 14:  anywhere.

1491
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:16,140
Speaker 13:  Stop playing what? Get outta here, huh? Yeah. I want you to

1492
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:18,900
Speaker 13:  stop playing and get outta here so I can game on that Chromebook.

1493
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:19,940
Speaker 14:  Got it.

1494
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,660
Speaker 14:  Go discover the ultimate cloud gaming machine,

1495
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,700
Speaker 14:  a new kind of Chromebook.

1496
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,010
Speaker 15:  This episode is brought to you by Google. The Google cybersecurity

Speaker 15:  cybersecurity visit safety.google/cyber

1499
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:40,730
Speaker 15:  workforce today.

1500
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:45,920
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back.

1501
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:51,600
Speaker 4:  Where, where do you wanna start? V I know you got feelings, you've been pent

1502
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,120
Speaker 4:  up over there.

1503
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:56,040
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so I think a lot of my problems this year is that the

1504
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:59,920
Speaker 6:  smartwatch updates across the board have been so iterative. So the one I'm

1505
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,600
Speaker 6:  actually looking most forward to is the Pixel Watch two, because it has the

1506
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,560
Speaker 6:  most room to grow. But everything else is like, I think I wrote a blog

1507
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:10,600
Speaker 6:  and it was buckle up buckles. We're gonna have some

1508
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:14,680
Speaker 6:  iterative smartwatch updates. And this is the definition

1509
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:15,560
Speaker 6:  of iterative

1510
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,560
Speaker 4:  By the way. Our internal analytics suggest that if you put buckle up in a

1511
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,600
Speaker 4:  headline, it bonkers over performs. Like I've heard Annie Hawkins

1512
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,560
Speaker 4:  say the phrase people love buckling up before.

1513
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,920
Speaker 6:  Well that explains it. 'cause that that blog did do well. So yeah.

1514
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:34,760
Speaker 6:  So You know, I I was, I was there and people were like, what's new about

1515
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:38,520
Speaker 6:  this watch? And it's like, well not much. Yeah. Like on the surface,

1516
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:42,520
Speaker 6:  at least like on the inside after, after kind of checking it out and thinking

1517
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,160
Speaker 6:  about what the new features are there, it feels like there is

1518
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:50,240
Speaker 6:  stuff happening, but none of it is apparent on the surface level.

1519
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:54,320
Speaker 6:  So if you look at the Apple Watch series nine, the most I can say is

1520
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,160
Speaker 6:  that it now comes in Barbie pink, which I love. But looking at it, it

1521
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,120
Speaker 6:  looks like the series eight,

1522
01:17:59,490 --> 01:17:59,840
Speaker 4:  Which

1523
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,960
Speaker 5:  Looked like the series seven, which

1524
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,760
Speaker 6:  Looked like the series, the seven series six. No, no, no. That there's, there's

1525
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,160
Speaker 6:  a slightly thinner bezel from

1526
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:06,520
Speaker 4:  Hey.

1527
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:07,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So

1528
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,600
Speaker 5:  Ignoring thinner bezels looked like the series six. Yes. Which looked like

1529
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,960
Speaker 5:  the series five, which looked like a series four.

1530
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:14,600
Speaker 6:  It it, it hasn't really changed in terms of looks, it gets incrementally

1531
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,800
Speaker 6:  larger when they're like, ah, screens, let's make them slightly larger. And

1532
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,240
Speaker 6:  then You know the Ultra two. I actually got told to put my original Ultra

1533
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:24,880
Speaker 6:  away because they were afraid I was going to lose it.

1534
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:29,080
Speaker 6:  That's how similar it looks like to the Ultra two. Wow. So

1535
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,960
Speaker 6:  they were like, we just wanna make sure you don't lose your watch. And it

1536
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,400
Speaker 6:  was like, well I have this nomad glow in the dark band on, so there's no

1537
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,360
Speaker 6:  way I'm losing this. And they're

1538
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,720
Speaker 4:  Like, man, there pick pockets here. Yeah. On the demo floor.

1539
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:44,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I get where they were coming from though. 'cause I was holding the,

1540
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,920
Speaker 6:  the Ultra in my hand and I was like, I think this Ultra is lighter. The Ultra

1541
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,880
Speaker 6:  two is lighter. And and this woman was looking at me and she's like, I think

1542
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,720
Speaker 6:  it's your stroke. Which is their, which is their way of telling me that it's,

1543
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,120
Speaker 6:  it's not, it's the same. Yeah. It's basically the same body. So I was like,

1544
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,000
Speaker 6:  okay cool. And You know with the Ultra

1545
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,760
Speaker 6:  two there was at least the rumor that it was gonna come in a darker color.

1546
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:08,760
Speaker 6:  That that's not the case. It is the same titanium color because titanium

1547
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:12,720
Speaker 6:  is hard to make different colors. So I just don't think they were, they were

1548
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:16,320
Speaker 6:  really gonna do that with this one. But You know it,

1549
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,560
Speaker 6:  it basically comes down to there's a new chip. Yeah, there's a new chip And

1550
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,200
Speaker 6:  it's been a while since there was a new chip. And the new chip will enable

1551
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:27,440
Speaker 6:  more things. What more things? Well it's all gonna be in the

1552
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:31,080
Speaker 6:  background so you probably will notice how much more convenient

1553
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,560
Speaker 6:  everything is gonna be for you. But it will be, it's like Siri will

1554
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,480
Speaker 6:  understand you more and it'll do everything lies.

1555
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:42,520
Speaker 4:  They were like, there's nothing that understand using an on-device transformer

1556
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:46,320
Speaker 4:  model, which is as close as they got to saying ai. It said machine learning

1557
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:50,120
Speaker 4:  a lot, but no AI except for one mention of transformer model in the Siri

1558
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:50,400
Speaker 4:  section.

1559
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:54,640
Speaker 6:  So yeah, so Siri is supposed to do things on device meaning, so like right

1560
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,360
Speaker 6:  now if you are in your laundry room and it's in the basement and you

1561
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,160
Speaker 6:  don't have your phone with you and you say, Siri set my timer for five minutes

1562
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,720
Speaker 6:  from my laundry or whatever, it's not gonna work. Siri will be just like,

1563
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,280
Speaker 6:  ha sorry, can't do that for you. And it's happened to me a lot of times.

1564
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:12,400
Speaker 6:  But now supposedly Siri will be able to do that for you even if

1565
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,680
Speaker 6:  you have no connection. Which You know if you think about it, that's actually

1566
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:19,680
Speaker 6:  kind of convenient and you think about it in a way, it's like,

1567
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:22,600
Speaker 6:  well didn't it always do that? And no, no, it's not something that they've

1568
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,000
Speaker 6:  always done. But then at the same time you're like, okay well they're saying

1569
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:30,040
Speaker 6:  Siri will have 25% better diction. I am gonna conduct

1570
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:33,920
Speaker 6:  the longest sentence to test this with, with so many multi

1571
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:38,120
Speaker 6:  syllables and probably an ethnic or international word thrown in there

1572
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,000
Speaker 6:  just to like throw it off. 'cause there was a point in time where I said

1573
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,600
Speaker 6:  Mahershala Ali a lot just to see whether Siri, would

1574
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:47,480
Speaker 6:  Siri understand it? Just Siri. Yeah. She did not. Okay. It did

1575
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,440
Speaker 4:  Not, don't gender the robot.

1576
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:52,240
Speaker 6:  But I'm not gendering Siri. It did not understand that. Now it does. So I

1577
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:56,200
Speaker 6:  can tell you it has improved over time. So You know I'm gonna,

1578
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:59,760
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna You know. I will take suggestions for what ridiculous words I can

1579
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:03,440
Speaker 6:  try and make. Yeah. Siri understand me with, but You know there,

1580
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:07,080
Speaker 6:  there's supposedly that's what's gonna happen. And later on in the year,

1581
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:10,000
Speaker 6:  Siri is gonna be able to answer your health data. Which I don't know how

1582
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:10,400
Speaker 6:  I feel about,

1583
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:14,480
Speaker 4:  Do you see on the, the, the You know the, the flying things you could

1584
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,840
Speaker 4:  say to Siri about health data. And one of them was like, Siri, I weigh this

1585
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,680
Speaker 4:  much today. And it's like sociopath, that's sociopath stuff.

1586
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,560
Speaker 4:  If you're just announcing to your watch how much you weigh every day, like

1587
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:26,560
Speaker 4:  nope. Again, something has gone wrong.

1588
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:30,760
Speaker 6:  Some of that is like they're thinking like, can we do this?

1589
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:34,240
Speaker 6:  Not whether we should. Yeah. Like I don't think you should necessarily be

1590
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:37,880
Speaker 6:  being like, Siri log my weight as X pounds or

1591
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:38,680
Speaker 6:  kilograms.

1592
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:42,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I I didn't purchase a connected scale. I bought a new Apple watch

1593
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,880
Speaker 4:  to which I announced my weight every day.

1594
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:51,040
Speaker 4:  But that stuff is like interesting, right? It's all background. The the

1595
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,520
Speaker 4:  processor's more powerful. They're doing more local processing of stuff.

1596
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,480
Speaker 5:  It also enables some other things. It

1597
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,040
Speaker 6:  Does enable some other things like double tap or as I

1598
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:00,960
Speaker 5:  Like to call it pinchy pinch.

1599
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,960
Speaker 6:  Pinchy pinch. It's the pinchy pinch. They

1600
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,640
Speaker 4:  Rejected that one. They didn't, that was on whiteboard at Apple Park. They

1601
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,800
Speaker 5:  Didn't, they didn't like that one. But I like it.

1602
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:10,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no pinchy pinch. That's actually like they're saying it's new. It's

1603
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:13,680
Speaker 6:  not really new because they introduced assistive touch a couple years ago,

1604
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,520
Speaker 6:  which is an accessibility feature which lets you control the

1605
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,440
Speaker 6:  watch one-handed and now they're just kind of bringing it to the

1606
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:25,400
Speaker 6:  masses, which in my view proves that accessible design benefits

1607
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,240
Speaker 6:  everybody but You know. So you, you can do a little pinchy pinch

1608
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:33,120
Speaker 6:  motion and you'll be able to do all the primary actions of

1609
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,760
Speaker 6:  your watch single-handed. So someone calls you, you're washing your ditches,

1610
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:40,560
Speaker 6:  you can pinchy pinch official term, you can pinchy pinch and

1611
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,520
Speaker 6:  answer the phone call or You know you, let's say set up

1612
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,960
Speaker 6:  your camera and you wanna take a photo, you can now pinchy pinch and control

1613
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,720
Speaker 6:  the shutter. Cool. If you You know watch OSS 10 has the new

1614
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:54,560
Speaker 6:  widget stacks. 'cause it's all about widgets. So you can scroll through your

1615
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,360
Speaker 6:  wi your widgets by pinching. So it essentially

1616
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:02,040
Speaker 6:  becomes a one-handed device because You know you wear it on one wrist, you

1617
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,400
Speaker 6:  have to use your other hand to to use it. But now you don't have

1618
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,120
Speaker 4:  To do that. Incredible moment of the keynote when Jeff Williams said, this

1619
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,560
Speaker 4:  is great for those moments when your other hand is occupied.

1620
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,560
Speaker 4:  No, no further details. Yeah,

1621
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:13,800
Speaker 5:  No examples of

1622
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,800
Speaker 4:  What it can be occupied with but, and it's like, well you're just waving

1623
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,040
Speaker 4:  your watch hand around and then this hand's busy. And I was like, okay.

1624
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:23,840
Speaker 4:  Incredible thing to say out loud. You're the co again of the richest, the

1625
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,640
Speaker 4:  c o o of the richest company in the world. And you're like, You know a problem.

1626
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:30,600
Speaker 4:  I have a lot. One hand's busy. It's like weird. It's

1627
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,160
Speaker 4:  weird. It's weird all the way around. And I was like, You know what? Like

1628
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:37,480
Speaker 4:  that's better than using my nose, which is what I have been doing this whole

1629
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:37,960
Speaker 4:  time. That's

1630
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:41,640
Speaker 6:  It is, it is better than that. 'cause like we have all gone like, ah crap,

1631
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:45,040
Speaker 6:  someone's calling me like Yep. Stick your nose into the, into the watch.

1632
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,960
Speaker 6:  So it, it is better. I I do have some questions about how

1633
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,600
Speaker 6:  intuitive it'll be for everyone because with assistive touch you're basically

1634
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,840
Speaker 6:  being very specific about what these actions are doing. This is meant to

1635
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,560
Speaker 6:  be more contextual. So they're kind of making assumptions

1636
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:03,640
Speaker 6:  as to what you are going to think when you, when it comes time to

1637
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:07,520
Speaker 6:  pinchy pinch. And I don't know that everyone has the same thoughts.

1638
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:11,800
Speaker 6:  They did tell me that some aspects will be customizable. So when you are

1639
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:14,840
Speaker 6:  going to do your music, not everyone has the same thought about whether it's

1640
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,200
Speaker 6:  going to play pause or skip forward because

1641
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:21,840
Speaker 6:  these are different assumptions we have from other devices. So that at least

1642
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,800
Speaker 6:  will be customizable. There's another one that I forget what will

1643
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,760
Speaker 6:  be customizable but eh You know. So that, that's cool on a

1644
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,280
Speaker 6:  very nerd level. I find it cool that it does not have to be your index finger.

1645
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,560
Speaker 6:  You can use your middle finger or your ring

1646
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,480
Speaker 4:  Finger. Oh that's important. Yeah,

1647
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:39,400
Speaker 6:  It's very important. 'cause I was like, hmm, yeah, what if you don't have

1648
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:43,240
Speaker 6:  an index finger, which is You know some, some people don't have index

1649
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:47,160
Speaker 6:  fingers. So that at least is neat

1650
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:51,640
Speaker 6:  and I think it will be kind of cool once you get used

1651
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:55,320
Speaker 6:  to using it. But you do have to get used to using it. I did the demo like

1652
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:59,520
Speaker 6:  six different times on the demo floor and for the first few times

1653
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,840
Speaker 6:  I was just aggressively pinching likes.

1654
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:02,320
Speaker 4:  It's

1655
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:05,280
Speaker 5:  Not, the thing that makes it hard like initially is the watch has to be awake.

1656
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:08,760
Speaker 5:  So you have to do the gesture to wake it up, then you pinchy pinch and then

1657
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,680
Speaker 5:  it, then it works more reliably. But, but if you're, if the watch isn't awake,

1658
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,560
Speaker 5:  you'll just be pinching. Yeah.

1659
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:16,320
Speaker 6:  That that was me. I was just pinching and I was like, why isn't it working?

1660
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:19,640
Speaker 6:  And they're like, oh, you have to do the gesture to wake it up and then you

1661
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:23,360
Speaker 6:  can pinch. Yeah. But then I was only pinching once and not

1662
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,160
Speaker 6:  double pinching. So it has to be a double,

1663
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:26,920
Speaker 5:  It's it's not a pinch, it's a pinchy pinch.

1664
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:27,880
Speaker 6:  It's

1665
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,000
Speaker 4:  A pinchy.

1666
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,000
Speaker 7:  Are they gonna add like

1667
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:29,480
Speaker 6:  A double?

1668
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:33,440
Speaker 4:  It's like brute forcing this into reality and making it, I don't want

1669
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:33,720
Speaker 4:  you to,

1670
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,920
Speaker 6:  I mean it, I I am just thinking of myself. Eventually I will be double wristing.

1671
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:42,680
Speaker 6:  'cause I'm always double wristing except for right now. But, and I'm just

1672
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,600
Speaker 6:  gonna be sitting here just thinking, oh my gosh,

1673
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,120
Speaker 7:  I can't wait.

1674
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,560
Speaker 4:  So this is not You know there, their whole thing is this is because the SS

1675
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,240
Speaker 4:  nine chip we're doing sensor fusion. We're measuring your blood flow.

1676
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,920
Speaker 4:  I dunno about that. Well,

1677
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,960
Speaker 5:  So I mean that is how it's worried. It's, it's monitoring the muscles in

1678
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,880
Speaker 5:  your forearm that react when you do these gestures with your fingers. So

1679
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,480
Speaker 5:  that, that is why it works with your other fingers. And like they said, You

1680
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,320
Speaker 5:  know you could do it with a pinky, but depending on certain people the way

1681
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,880
Speaker 5:  their arms are, it may not work as reliably. And that

1682
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:15,560
Speaker 5:  most people, it works reliably with the index finger or the middle finger.

1683
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:19,040
Speaker 5:  But it's, but that's what it's monitoring. It's monitoring the blood flow

1684
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:21,240
Speaker 5:  through your wrist in your forearm.

1685
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:24,880
Speaker 4:  So is the heart rate sensor on all the time? Yes, yes. Yes.

1686
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,600
Speaker 5:  At well when it's awake

1687
01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:28,320
Speaker 4:  They light up the heart rate sensor.

1688
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,520
Speaker 5:  There's, and yeah, it lights up the heart rate sensor and then it's ready

1689
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,480
Speaker 5:  to, to, I think this is probably why it doesn't work when it's not awake.

1690
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:38,440
Speaker 5:  One probably to stop false triggers, but also it does have to light up

1691
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,040
Speaker 5:  a bunch of sensors in order to detect.

1692
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,800
Speaker 4:  And so this, but this is the argument of the S nine, right? We need the gyroscope,

1693
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:46,840
Speaker 4:  we need the heart heart rate sensor, which they hadn't mentioned specifically.

1694
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,920
Speaker 4:  That's really cool to know. And then we're doing sensor fusion and machine

1695
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,080
Speaker 4:  learning. Yeah. And we're detecting a pinch.

1696
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,960
Speaker 5:  That's what, that's what the S nine enables and that's what all the extra

1697
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:57,840
Speaker 5:  cores. It's got a four core neural co-processor, whatever they call

1698
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:02,000
Speaker 5:  it, a sip as opposed instead of an S O C that we're used to hearing from

1699
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,320
Speaker 5:  other devices.

1700
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,960
Speaker 4:  SS o C is everything is on the same chip. D the SIP is

1701
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,040
Speaker 4:  a package. So you have multiple chips integrated package stacked and assembled

1702
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:10,840
Speaker 4:  into a package. Yeah.

1703
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:14,080
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So they keep referring to the SS nine as a sip, but it's got all those

1704
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,840
Speaker 5:  and it's, and like this is why you have a neural processor on your wrist

1705
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:20,200
Speaker 5:  to figure out these kinds of features.

1706
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:24,240
Speaker 6:  Also more power efficient. But You know, apple has this

1707
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:28,040
Speaker 6:  tendency of like with power efficiency to be like and So, we will do

1708
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:31,680
Speaker 6:  more things with the power efficiency that we have instead of giving what

1709
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:34,840
Speaker 6:  some people want, which is longer battery life. So You know,

1710
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:35,960
Speaker 4:  You know

1711
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:37,240
Speaker 5:  The screen gets brighter, the screen

1712
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:37,360
Speaker 6:  Gets,

1713
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,720
Speaker 4:  Gets

1714
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,560
Speaker 5:  Brighter, made the screen goes up to 2000 NIS on the S nine now

1715
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,160
Speaker 6:  On the, on the series nine. And we

1716
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,240
Speaker 5:  Saw a demo compared to the eight and it

1717
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,120
Speaker 6:  Was noticeable.

1718
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,040
Speaker 5:  Noticeably different. Noticeable.

1719
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:45,440
Speaker 6:  It's noticeable

1720
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,240
Speaker 5:  When it's at Peak prices.

1721
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:50,080
Speaker 6:  So like the original Ultra goes up to 2000 niss. Yeah. And when you're outside,

1722
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,960
Speaker 6:  that's quite bright. And now the Ultra two goes up to 3000. So

1723
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:54,800
Speaker 6:  I'm just like, wow.

1724
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:58,600
Speaker 4:  Could you see that? Was that, that seems like a difficult thing to see, so

1725
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,120
Speaker 4:  I'm not sure outside. Yeah,

1726
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:04,600
Speaker 6:  You need the older model right next to it at Max brightness

1727
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:08,160
Speaker 6:  to really understand it. 'cause when I was looking at the SS nine in the

1728
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:11,720
Speaker 6:  perfect lighting in, in heaven's Steve Jobs theater, I was like,

1729
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,600
Speaker 6:  I I I can't tell the difference. But when they put the two next to each other,

1730
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:16,880
Speaker 6:  then you could see that. Yeah,

1731
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,240
Speaker 5:  Well they, they put, they, they, they demoed an SS eight that had been tricked

1732
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,960
Speaker 5:  into full brightness and an S nine that had been tricked into full brightness

1733
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:26,360
Speaker 5:  next to each other. And that's when you could see it. And the idea being

1734
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,840
Speaker 5:  that if you are in an environment where you need this brightness, that's

1735
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:32,080
Speaker 5:  where it'll come help you. But ultimately it just looked nicer when it's

1736
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:32,280
Speaker 5:  brighter.

1737
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:36,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah it does. Yeah. But that's brighter screens

1738
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:40,640
Speaker 6:  and You know, they always say the same battery life, it's never the same.

1739
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:44,920
Speaker 6:  Like with smartwatches, your individual usage really does kind of

1740
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,680
Speaker 6:  impact how much mileage you're going to get. But when, when Apple

1741
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:52,560
Speaker 6:  says 18 hour battery life, like the series four Hmm. That was maybe

1742
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:57,200
Speaker 6:  like 24 hours Series five that was Hmm. Maybe 20

1743
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:01,160
Speaker 6:  hours. Like you can get more, apple is very conservative

1744
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,600
Speaker 6:  with their battery life estimates. So when they say 18 hours, I, I'm

1745
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,440
Speaker 6:  really gonna see how how far you can push that 18 hours for the original,

1746
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:13,160
Speaker 6:  not the original for the regular one, but for the Ultra two they said it

1747
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:16,880
Speaker 6:  was 36. Yeah. And I just You know I have gotten as far as 60 hours

1748
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:20,880
Speaker 6:  on the Ultra without doing anything going on

1749
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,840
Speaker 6:  runs. Like I did a half marathon, a slow half marathon. I

1750
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,640
Speaker 6:  was not fast that day and I think I only lost 15% battery.

1751
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:32,680
Speaker 6:  Wow. With no low power mode enabled. So I'm really

1752
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:36,560
Speaker 6:  curious to see whether the, the extra power efficiency

1753
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:40,600
Speaker 6:  will push the Ultra into the 70, 72

1754
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:42,440
Speaker 6:  hour territory. Because I haven't, which

1755
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,320
Speaker 4:  Is what they're claiming for low power mode, which

1756
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,800
Speaker 6:  Is what they're claiming for low power mode. But I think, I think

1757
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,720
Speaker 6:  depending on how you use it, because let's be real, not everyone buying

1758
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,440
Speaker 6:  an Ultra is the weather beaten explorer athlete that they

1759
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:55,920
Speaker 6:  No, they said

1760
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,440
Speaker 4:  This. So you wrote a piece that was like, who is the Ultra for? And I think

1761
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,840
Speaker 4:  Chef Williams read it

1762
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:06,280
Speaker 4:  because in his presentation he was like, here's who the Apple Watch Ultra

1763
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,080
Speaker 4:  is for. He said, did you catch this? He said it out loud. Yeah. And his

1764
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,720
Speaker 4:  answer was, it's for people who want a big display in the best battery life.

1765
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:17,800
Speaker 4:  And he was not like an ocean explorer. It's like, it was like the biggest

1766
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,160
Speaker 4:  display and the best battery life.

1767
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,960
Speaker 6:  Because I, I'm gonna be real, like I go to, I am not the most athletic

1768
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,760
Speaker 6:  person on the planet. I would consider myself a weekend warrior, a reformed

1769
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:30,600
Speaker 6:  couch potato. Like I, I, I do do a lot of exercise. I

1770
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,200
Speaker 6:  exercise probably like six outta seven days of the week. But I'm not

1771
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:38,200
Speaker 6:  athletically gifted and I never will be. But I do go to like

1772
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,560
Speaker 6:  run groups. I have friends who are athletically gifted and absolutely none

1773
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:45,200
Speaker 6:  of them are interested in the Ultra. They're just not, they're like, I grab

1774
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:49,120
Speaker 6:  my Garmin and my Garmin has 40,000 metrics that the, that

1775
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:53,080
Speaker 6:  the Apple watch will never have. And they're very like, happy with that or

1776
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:57,080
Speaker 6:  a regular Apple watch. So thinking about that, I was just like,

1777
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,120
Speaker 6:  I don't think that the Ultra is really

1778
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:05,040
Speaker 6:  for those extreme athletes until you can be like, oh yeah,

1779
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:08,760
Speaker 6:  the Ultra marathon or you can run 60 hours. I don't know why you would want

1780
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,720
Speaker 6:  to, but I know these people do run 60 hours and you won't need to

1781
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:16,320
Speaker 6:  carry your charger on you until, until it can legitimately do that. I don't

1782
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:19,600
Speaker 6:  think that the Ultra is really for that extreme

1783
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:23,800
Speaker 6:  explorer. So that was a question I did have. Like who is this

1784
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:27,920
Speaker 6:  watch for? And the facetious answer that I get is, is

1785
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,680
Speaker 6:  for people who wanna flex, it's for people who have $800

1786
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:34,360
Speaker 6:  and yes and no. Right? Because,

1787
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:38,600
Speaker 4:  And on the iPhone side, if you have $800, you get, you're like, you

1788
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,280
Speaker 4:  get last year's garbage

1789
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:41,400
Speaker 6:  Year's garbage. Here's

1790
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:44,640
Speaker 4:  Shit we had in the part spin. You must be two. Yeah, exactly. This is a,

1791
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,200
Speaker 4:  this is an eighties Pontiac

1792
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:50,440
Speaker 4:  made of leftover Cadillac parts. Like that's what we're doing here.

1793
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:53,920
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Oh, the other thing that the Ultra that, that they did demo for us

1794
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,880
Speaker 6:  on the Ultra two was this automatic night mode. And I was

1795
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:01,520
Speaker 6:  like, woo. This was was like a parlor trick that I should not have been as

1796
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,080
Speaker 6:  excited to see as I was. But if you turn off the light, it'll automatically

1797
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,160
Speaker 6:  switch into that red mode and you turn the light

1798
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:10,440
Speaker 5:  On. This is because the changes with Watch West 10. Yes. So you used to on

1799
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,520
Speaker 5:  watch West nine with the first Ultra, you use the digital crown to switch

1800
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,480
Speaker 5:  between the special watch face between its night mode reds, which

1801
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:20,480
Speaker 5:  you, you can't do on that watch face Neli. You need to use a special watch

1802
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,840
Speaker 5:  face. Yeah. But with watch West 10, if you spin the crown, you go into the

1803
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,640
Speaker 5:  widgets. So you couldn't do that anymore. So basically they're using the

1804
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,280
Speaker 5:  light sensor to know when the lights are out and switch into the dark box.

1805
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:32,160
Speaker 6:  But that, that actually is something that I'm like, ah, there we go.

1806
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:34,640
Speaker 5:  And to be clear, this is coming to the first Ultra as well. Yes.

1807
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:35,720
Speaker 6:  Yes. It's, it's so,

1808
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,160
Speaker 5:  It's not not exclusive.

1809
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:40,960
Speaker 6:  I'm just gonna complain about smart watches for a hot second, remembering

1810
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:44,880
Speaker 6:  what comes on, watch OSS 10 to which watches

1811
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,880
Speaker 6:  and which is exclusive to what, on what skews

1812
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:53,320
Speaker 6:  is, is just like, I need a whole other co-processor brain to remember that.

1813
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:57,360
Speaker 6:  You need a sip, I need a sip. I need a sip to, to memorize all that stuff.

1814
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:57,720
Speaker 6:  SIP

1815
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:58,040
Speaker 5:  Is something,

1816
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:01,520
Speaker 4:  But is a new, there's a new watch face. You know watch faces. Yep. Modular

1817
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:03,160
Speaker 4:  Ultra. Is that coming to this Ultra?

1818
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:03,840
Speaker 6:  Yes, it is coming.

1819
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:08,480
Speaker 5:  Watch 10. Yep. There's no real reason for anyone to upgrade

1820
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,800
Speaker 5:  from the first Ultra to the

1821
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,440
Speaker 4:  Second. Well, it's the Flex Dan, I mean, other than

1822
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:15,240
Speaker 5:  Flex, you get the pinchy pinch and you get the 3000 knits

1823
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,280
Speaker 5:  and that's really it. Oh,

1824
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,080
Speaker 6:  And the new U two

1825
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,400
Speaker 5:  Chip and the U two chip for

1826
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:23,560
Speaker 6:  Precision finding. Yeah. Which my fellow A D H

1827
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:27,600
Speaker 6:  D can't remember where you put anything. Hell yeah, it's, but you

1828
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,360
Speaker 6:  have to get an iPhone 15 for that to actually work. Yeah. But You know, they

1829
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,240
Speaker 6:  showed it to us and it was like, oh, it'll tell you exactly which direction

1830
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:39,080
Speaker 6:  to go, how far to go to find your phone, which I'm super excited

1831
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,880
Speaker 6:  about because I have lost my phone in a fridge before.

1832
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:45,320
Speaker 5:  It's, it's basically the same experience. You get tracking an air tag with

1833
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,320
Speaker 5:  an iPhone. Yes. Except you're tracking an iPhone with your Apple watch.

1834
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:52,200
Speaker 6:  It's a little slower. I did notice that, because when you do, when you do

1835
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:55,920
Speaker 6:  do it with the air tag, it's like pretty quick. This, you can only track

1836
01:33:56,270 --> 01:34:00,120
Speaker 6:  your iPhone 15. You can't track like an air

1837
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:03,480
Speaker 6:  tag that's gonna be there. So it, it does need to have that. But I was like,

1838
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:07,560
Speaker 6:  yes. For me specifically, I use the find my phone

1839
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,600
Speaker 6:  function at least 20 to 30 times a day. So yeah,

1840
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:15,560
Speaker 4:  That's it. But the watch, it's a, they upgraded a chip, they made things

1841
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:16,840
Speaker 4:  a little bit brighter. They

1842
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:17,720
Speaker 5:  Did not make, they added

1843
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:17,960
Speaker 4:  The double

1844
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:19,880
Speaker 5:  Tap titanium series nine, which they

1845
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:23,120
Speaker 4:  Did not make a titanium series nine. Really. It's interesting that the double

1846
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:25,960
Speaker 4:  tap is hardware locked. These new ones. Do we think that the old phones,

1847
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:27,720
Speaker 4:  the old watches can't do 'em?

1848
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:31,880
Speaker 5:  That is their line, right? That their line is that the S nine enables this

1849
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,040
Speaker 5:  feature because of its neural engine and because it's able to take all that

1850
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,440
Speaker 5:  data from the sensors and spit out something smart. And

1851
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,280
Speaker 4:  Yet if you turn on an assistive, touch it like,

1852
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:43,480
Speaker 6:  So I think the part of that is the, the contextualizing of it so that

1853
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:47,320
Speaker 6:  it's built into the system. Whereas assistive touch is something

1854
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:51,200
Speaker 6:  that you have to go in and enable. And there is kind of a learning

1855
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:55,200
Speaker 6:  curve with assistive touch. So there's that. There's

1856
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:59,000
Speaker 6:  also more customizability with assistive touch. So yeah, I

1857
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,840
Speaker 6:  don't know, but yeah. Yeah, like I could see

1858
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:06,080
Speaker 6:  an argument for that just because your wrist is a very noisy place in terms

1859
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:09,360
Speaker 6:  of sensors. It's actually not great for heart rate

1860
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,400
Speaker 6:  accuracy. The, I think the most accurate place is the underside of your finger,

1861
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:17,400
Speaker 6:  where your ear, so on that front, if you want

1862
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,160
Speaker 6:  it to be accurate, if you want it to be something that a lot of people can

1863
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:23,720
Speaker 6:  use reliably with multiple fingers, I could see an argument for

1864
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:27,280
Speaker 6:  needing a more powerful sip for that. But eh,

1865
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:30,040
Speaker 6:  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, that's what I'm gonna say.

1866
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,280
Speaker 4:  That's good. No, that's well remembered.

1867
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:36,720
Speaker 4:  I think that's Watch we didn't say the prices. The Apple Watch series

1868
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:40,160
Speaker 4:  9 3 9 3 9 9. The Ultra seven nine

1869
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,640
Speaker 4:  You know if you wanna flex. Yeah,

1870
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:45,320
Speaker 5:  If you wanna flex. They did not drop the price of the se. Some folks were

1871
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,560
Speaker 5:  hypothesizing that they might drop the SE price. That did happen, but

1872
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,040
Speaker 6:  They dropped it last year. It went from two. But You

1873
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,240
Speaker 5:  Know, I think there's an argument that they should, that they, there's room

1874
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:55,440
Speaker 5:  to drop it now that the series three is dead and gone. There's nothing at

1875
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,480
Speaker 5:  that 1 99 price point.

1876
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:00,640
Speaker 4:  All this stuff hits September 22nd. Yep. All of it is pre-orders on

1877
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:04,600
Speaker 4:  Friday. Yeah. iOS 17 comes out September 18th. Maca

1878
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,470
Speaker 4:  Sonoma, September 26th. And then also the 22nd are the

1879
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:11,830
Speaker 4:  USB C AirPods Pro, which have

1880
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:16,270
Speaker 4:  mysterious and another mystery. They have a new mysterious

1881
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:20,190
Speaker 4:  Lossless audio feature that for the Vision Pro only works with the Vision

1882
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:23,790
Speaker 4:  Pro. Yes. It is a quote, groundbreaking new

1883
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:27,630
Speaker 4:  wireless audio protocol and quote, revolutionary new format

1884
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:32,070
Speaker 4:  that allows 20 bit 48 kilohertz audio transmission from the

1885
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:34,750
Speaker 4:  Vision Pro to the AirPods Pro. So the

1886
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:39,230
Speaker 4:  goodbye Bluetooth. Get outta here. You old pirate.

1887
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:39,990
Speaker 4:  Like

1888
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:44,030
Speaker 5:  I wonder, I wonder if it is a, a modification or a form of Bluetooth. I think

1889
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:48,350
Speaker 5:  if I had to like hypothesize as to like why it's an only on the Vision

1890
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:51,350
Speaker 5:  Pro. I wonder if it's a distance thing. If you're wearing the AirPods and

1891
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:55,230
Speaker 5:  the Vision Pro in your head, there's a maximum of six inches of distance

1892
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:59,150
Speaker 5:  between the devices. Whereas if it's on your phone and the AirPods,

1893
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:02,430
Speaker 5:  you've got a few feet between them and it can't maintain that Fidelity,

1894
01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:04,190
Speaker 4:  Who knows man, who knows

1895
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:05,950
Speaker 5:  The phone's got a Thread radio man.

1896
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:10,270
Speaker 4:  It's like there's just a lot of mysteries that Apple did not address today.

1897
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:13,870
Speaker 4:  It obviously doesn't work with the iPhone. No Lossless audio from the AirPods

1898
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:17,070
Speaker 4:  Pro. The old AirPods Pro don't get it.

1899
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:21,990
Speaker 4:  And you cannot buy the USB C case for your old AirPods Pro. We were told

1900
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:24,950
Speaker 4:  that it might be a quote service part, which is fascinating. Yeah.

1901
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:29,590
Speaker 5:  The precedence for it being sold separately was when they

1902
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:33,510
Speaker 5:  moved, I think it was the AirPods two came out initially did not have

1903
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:36,310
Speaker 5:  wireless charging and then they updated it to a wireless charging case. You

1904
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:39,590
Speaker 5:  could just buy the case if you wanted, but it doesn't look like that's happening

1905
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:43,510
Speaker 5:  with the USB C AirPods Pro two. Also notable the regular AirPods

1906
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:47,190
Speaker 5:  three not getting USB C. We mentioned earlier the AirPods Max

1907
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:49,670
Speaker 5:  not getting USB C, at least not today. So Yeah.

1908
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:54,150
Speaker 4:  But the AirPods Pro also the 22nd with

1909
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:54,910
Speaker 4:  USB C. Yes.

1910
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:58,720
Speaker 5:  You can buy, this is mysterious. If you have an AirPods Pro two today, you

1911
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,400
Speaker 5:  can buy New AirPods Pro two.

1912
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:05,400
Speaker 5:  That's good. And I don't know, they've been out for a while. Maybe your battery's

1913
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,240
Speaker 5:  not lasting. All

1914
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:10,200
Speaker 4:  Right. I think that's it. We've really bled this one dry. We've

1915
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,640
Speaker 4:  talked about every bento on the Bento box. It was, I mean, it was a good

1916
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:17,480
Speaker 4:  event. It was. It was fun to be there and like do our thing. When I say that

1917
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,840
Speaker 4:  Bento boxes don't have a lot of stuff on them, the iPhone 15 Bento box has

1918
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:21,600
Speaker 4:  five G on it.

1919
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:23,920
Speaker 5:  Oh no.

1920
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:28,000
Speaker 4:  And it's like you guys like, what are we doing here? But yeah, ITER

1921
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,160
Speaker 4:  updates all around, but I think solid. I think U S PC stuff is gonna go over

1922
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:34,440
Speaker 4:  well. But that's it. This is the beginning of just a bonkers

1923
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:38,360
Speaker 4:  two months in tech basically. September, October are gonna be nuts. We'll

1924
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:41,080
Speaker 4:  be back on Friday. Talk about the Google antitrust case and everything else

1925
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:45,040
Speaker 4:  that's happening. And then it is just a sprint to the finish line of fall

1926
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:48,880
Speaker 4:  from here on out. We are gonna be so dead at the end of this. It's gonna

1927
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,680
Speaker 4:  be good though. This is what we're here for. This is what you signed up for.

1928
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:54,640
Speaker 5:  It is true. It's why we, it's why we, it's why we wake up in the morning.

1929
01:38:55,150 --> 01:38:56,360
Speaker 4:  It's nuts. It's clear

1930
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:57,560
Speaker 5:  Brunch. Just year. It's very

1931
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:00,680
