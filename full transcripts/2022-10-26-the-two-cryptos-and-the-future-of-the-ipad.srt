00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,360
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Verge Cast, the flagship podcast of all screen designs.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,480
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and if I sound kind of hoarse this morning,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,360
Speaker 2:  it's because I just spent all weekend in Texas at the Formula One

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,600
Speaker 2:  United States Grand Prix.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,720
Speaker 2:  Normally, that's not really a tech thing, but this year Apple's CEO

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,480
Speaker 2:  Tim Cook, waved the checkered flag,

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,440
Speaker 4:  Possibly the worst checkered flag waving in Formula One history

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,640
Speaker 4:  by the Apple boss Tim Cook.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,600
Speaker 2:  So the good news is I think this is all technically a business expense now.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,240
Speaker 2:  That's how that works, right? This worked out great for me and not so great

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,600
Speaker 2:  for Tim Cook. Anyway, we have a great show for you today. We're gonna go

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,280
Speaker 2:  deep inside the world of crypto, but not the crypto

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,160
Speaker 2:  you're thinking of. Then we're gonna talk about the new iPad OS and

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,840
Speaker 2:  the new iPads, and we're gonna try to make sense of Apple's whole tablet

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,600
Speaker 2:  strategy because it seems like Apple's kind of losing the plot. All of that

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,000
Speaker 2:  is coming up in just a second. But first I need to go practice my flag waving

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,760
Speaker 2:  skills, because honestly, you never know when it'll be your turn and I'm

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,160
Speaker 2:  not gonna blow it like Tim Cook did.

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,360
Speaker 4:  So in all the iPhones and iPads and everything, can't give you a sort of

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,200
Speaker 4:  strong wrist and nice action to to do that. So come on, Tim Cook. You can

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,240
Speaker 4:  do better than that. Yeah, rather than, But anyway,

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,350
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Our first segment for today is a segment. If I'm being

24
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,190
Speaker 2:  completely honest with you, I know almost nothing about. So here

25
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,430
Speaker 2:  to help us explain what's about to happen is our senior audio director Andrew

26
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,230
Speaker 2:  Marino. Hi Andrew.

27
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,070
Speaker 5:  Hi David.

28
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,270
Speaker 2:  Let me tell you what I know about what's about to happen on this podcast.

29
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,950
Speaker 2:  It has to do with crypto. Yeah, but it doesn't have to do with Bitcoin. If

30
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,470
Speaker 2:  it, if this has to do with Bitcoin, you and I are gonna have a fight.

31
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,310
Speaker 5:  It kind of does. Okay.

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,910
Speaker 2:  Oh

33
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,190
Speaker 1:  No,

34
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,270
Speaker 2:  Tell me. Tell me what we're about to hear you. You went to investigate a

35
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,110
Speaker 2:  different kind of crypto world as I have come to understand

36
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,000
Speaker 5:  It. Yeah, Crypto, what that means is someone

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,720
Speaker 5:  who goes out and tries to discover new and

38
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,000
Speaker 5:  unknown animals

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,920
Speaker 2:  And then convince them to buy Bitcoin.

40
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,560
Speaker 5:  No. And however, a lot of that is associated with

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,920
Speaker 5:  creatures like the Moth man. Ah, Big Foot Chupacabra

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,560
Speaker 5:  Cobra. So there's crypto zoology, which was also

43
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,320
Speaker 5:  shortened to be crypto, but crypto is a whole

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,880
Speaker 5:  different thing now, right? So I wanted to talk to Crypto Zoologists

45
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,560
Speaker 5:  to see what they think about the new crypto,

46
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,520
Speaker 2:  What happens when you stop being the wildest crypto out there,

47
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,000
Speaker 2:  right? I love it. All right. Anything else we should know before we get into

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,040
Speaker 5:  It? I don't think so.

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,480
Speaker 2:  All right, let's do it.

50
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,440
Speaker 5:  The mention of the word cryptocurrency can be exhausting,

51
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,280
Speaker 5:  especially in the past year or so, the television advertisements,

52
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:52,920
Speaker 5:  I'm

53
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,280
Speaker 7:  Getting into crypto with ftx,

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,080
Speaker 5:  You in the memification of digital currency investments like

55
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,560
Speaker 5:  NFTs, everyone

56
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
Speaker 8:  Gets an yes. Everyone,

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,600
Speaker 2:  Everyone gets an energy.

58
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,120
Speaker 5:  The ups and downs of the price of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Luna,

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040
Speaker 5:  and others, all that stuff is often shortened to the word crypto,

60
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,080
Speaker 5:  a catchall term for any sort of blockchain technology.

61
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,080
Speaker 5:  But before it was the hottest topic in tech. Crypto had a

62
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,080
Speaker 5:  much different meaning in the English vernacular, at least in a certain

63
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,480
Speaker 5:  community.

64
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,920
Speaker 9:  Crypto to me met crypto zoology.

65
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,440
Speaker 5:  That's Lauren Coleman, a crypto zoologist and founder of

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,160
Speaker 5:  the International Crypto Zoology Museum in Portland, Maine. Lauren

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,880
Speaker 5:  has been writing about crypto zoology or the study of hidden and unknown

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,840
Speaker 5:  animals for over 40 years with books like Creatures of

69
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,000
Speaker 5:  the Outer Edge, Bigfoot, the True Story of Apes in America

70
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,040
Speaker 5:  and cryptozoology A to Z, the encyclopedia of

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,680
Speaker 5:  Lochs monsters, Sasquatch, Chupacabras, and other authentic mysteries of

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,320
Speaker 5:  nature. Lauren has been called the modern popularizer of the word

73
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,120
Speaker 5:  cryptozoology, though it's origins go back. Before he got

74
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,000
Speaker 5:  started in the field,

75
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,160
Speaker 9:  Crypto zoology was being bannered around

76
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,200
Speaker 9:  in correspondent between French I French

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,440
Speaker 9:  writers in 1959. Then in

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Speaker 9:  1961, Ivan Tea Anderson wrote the first use

79
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,560
Speaker 9:  of crypto zoology and English. What Sanderson

80
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,200
Speaker 9:  did was really examine a Bigfoot Yeti critter

81
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,640
Speaker 9:  reports from around the world.

82
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,000
Speaker 5:  So then crypto has often been used as shorthand for crypto

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,720
Speaker 5:  zoology.

84
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,120
Speaker 9:  I mean, even my mother-in-law does ever call me Lauren. She calls

85
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,600
Speaker 9:  me crypto

86
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,640
Speaker 5:  Crypto. The shorthand for cryptocurrency and the

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
Speaker 5:  blockchain and the web three stuff we hear about was adapted from the

88
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,320
Speaker 5:  practice of cryptography, the study of techniques for secure

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,240
Speaker 5:  communication, and looking into both cryptos, I started to realize

90
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,120
Speaker 5:  they were more closely related than I thought, but the first thing

91
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,720
Speaker 5:  I needed to know has this double meaning of the word crypto

92
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,400
Speaker 5:  caused confusion between the world's.

93
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,720
Speaker 5:  Lauren says he has experienced a bit of that confusion on

94
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,520
Speaker 5:  the internet, especially since his Twitter handle is at crypto. Lauren,

95
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,080
Speaker 9:  I have to constantly spend my precious

96
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,760
Speaker 9:  time doing tweets saying Crypto Lauren

97
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,840
Speaker 9:  is not out. Crypto coin, it's about cryptozoology.

98
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,480
Speaker 9:  I get tagged to, you know, news about a new

99
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,520
Speaker 9:  crypto bitcoin or this or that.

100
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,560
Speaker 5:  This happens not to just Lauren, but many people in the cryptozoology

101
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,720
Speaker 5:  community. Lauren says that his followers now pick up on this and

102
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,320
Speaker 5:  start threads campaigning that crypto means crypto zoology.

103
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,960
Speaker 5:  I've talked to a few people in the space who are podcasters or

104
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,760
Speaker 5:  bloggers who use the word crypto to mean crypto zoology, and

105
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,320
Speaker 5:  they're often met with pitches about Bitcoin and NFTs in their email.

106
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,080
Speaker 5:  But then again, who doesn't get those emails?

107
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,320
Speaker 10:  First of all, it's going to ruin your Google searches, right?

108
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,520
Speaker 5:  That's Sharon Hill, a researcher and writer of paranormal phenomena.

109
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,520
Speaker 5:  She also runs the blog Pop Goes the Crypted, which covers the way pop

110
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Speaker 5:  culture has interacted with crypto zoology.

111
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,960
Speaker 10:  I studied the social phenomenon of paranormal investigation

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,280
Speaker 10:  groups of all kinds, so ghost hunters, bigfoot seekers,

113
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,840
Speaker 10:  ufologists to find out why they did what they did, and if

114
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,680
Speaker 10:  they said they used science and if they said yes, how

115
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,320
Speaker 10:  did they use, or if they actually did use scientific processes

116
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,120
Speaker 10:  in their work.

117
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,080
Speaker 5:  I asked her a bit about the interaction between crypto zoology and

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,440
Speaker 5:  cryptocurrency communities on the internet.

119
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,680
Speaker 10:  It certainly caused some consternation for the people in the cryptozoology

120
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Speaker 10:  community and, and me too. You know, there are social tribes that are

121
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,200
Speaker 10:  based on specific interests, and the crypto zoo scene was

122
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,040
Speaker 10:  fairly small, and if you were actively involved, you knew everybody

123
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,440
Speaker 10:  that was participating. It was kind of a closed circle,

124
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,360
Speaker 10:  and it's easy to understand that that tribe or that group

125
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,200
Speaker 10:  would adopt the prefix crypto for some things, you know,

126
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,040
Speaker 10:  their websites, their usernames, et cetera, and then suddenly out of their

127
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,720
Speaker 10:  control comes this ragingly, popular new use of crypto

128
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,360
Speaker 10:  that doesn't relate it to them, and I think it perturb some people. They

129
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
Speaker 10:  felt a sense of ownership with that original usage, that prefects and

130
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,520
Speaker 10:  then their words and concepts are being used for something completely different,

131
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,080
Speaker 10:  especially when it's related to money and for profit

132
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,720
Speaker 10:  projects. They resented it, so they're just guarding their boundaries.

133
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,880
Speaker 5:  For the most part, the crypto zoology community has been using the word

134
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,560
Speaker 5:  crypto instead of crypto to talk about unknown creatures,

135
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,880
Speaker 5:  which helps steer away some of that confusion. For example,

136
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,800
Speaker 5:  cryptocurrency conventions are called crypto cons, while crypto

137
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Speaker 5:  zoology conventions are called crypto cons. But make

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,920
Speaker 5:  no mistake, Web three crypto enthusiasts have attempted to bridge

139
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
Speaker 5:  the two communities together.

140
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,120
Speaker 9:  I was approached by one in the cryptocurrency

141
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,800
Speaker 9:  field that wanted to take advantage of

142
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,840
Speaker 9:  my notoriety and being a museum director, and they wanted

143
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,600
Speaker 9:  to start, I can't remember the term it's What's the

144
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,000
Speaker 9:  nf?

145
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,320
Speaker 5:  Oh, NFTs.

146
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,920
Speaker 9:  Yeah. They said, Would you sell NFTs for us?

147
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,920
Speaker 9:  We'd have one that was Yeti and one that was a, you know, they'd take over

148
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,760
Speaker 9:  the names of Crys and make them and whatever that

149
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,440
Speaker 9:  works. You just

150
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,960
Speaker 5:  Said that. Yeah, NFTs, non fungible tokens.

151
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Speaker 9:  Right, right. And we talked for a while, a couple times

152
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,720
Speaker 9:  on the phone and I just backed off. I said,

153
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,680
Speaker 9:  Is there anything that I can get out of this to have as a

154
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Speaker 9:  physical artifact, because that's what we are

155
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,640
Speaker 9:  basing our medium on, but this makes no sense to me. He said, No.

156
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,280
Speaker 9:  I said, Well, I don't think we're checking in the same world.

157
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,600
Speaker 5:  Lauren says he has no plans currently to start accepting

158
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,440
Speaker 5:  Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for admission, not the crypto zoology

159
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,360
Speaker 5:  museum, but he clarifies no hard feelings against the other crypto

160
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,760
Speaker 5:  people.

161
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,760
Speaker 9:  Well, there seems to be a little battle. I don't care. I really am

162
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,640
Speaker 9:  not antagonistic against cryptocurrency people. I mean,

163
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,480
Speaker 9:  it's just a phantom type of currency. But then

164
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,160
Speaker 9:  when we think about it, I mean in general is all

165
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,760
Speaker 9:  phantom,

166
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,640
Speaker 5:  So are the two worlds continuing to stay separate? Are the

167
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,360
Speaker 5:  cryptozoology people in one corner of the internet and the

168
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,840
Speaker 5:  cryptocurrency people on the other corner? Not necessarily.

169
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,040
Speaker 5:  There certainly are some crypto zoologists investing in crypto

170
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,480
Speaker 5:  coin.

171
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,840
Speaker 12:  My name is Stephen t Major and I am the founder and director of

172
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,720
Speaker 12:  Operations of Extreme Expeditions Northwest llc, which

173
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,040
Speaker 12:  is an outdoor venture company that specializes in guided

174
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,920
Speaker 12:  bigfoot research expeditions and crypto coin

175
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,880
Speaker 12:  is a division of extreme expeditions. Northwest llc.

176
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:10,040
Speaker 5:  Stephen Major started getting into cryptocurrencies on his own, but

177
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,400
Speaker 5:  then realized that he could try to use its potential to support his quest

178
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,320
Speaker 5:  to track down undiscovered creatures in the world, which led to

179
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,960
Speaker 5:  crypted coin.

180
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,960
Speaker 12:  We believe that we could capture a Bigfoot, but it's all a matter of money.

181
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,000
Speaker 12:  One of the things that Bigfoot research or Crypted research and

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,840
Speaker 12:  investigation suffers from is a lack of funding. My ultimate goal

183
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,800
Speaker 12:  with it was to pitch it to people globally that are

184
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,520
Speaker 12:  into crypted research and investigation or fans of it, and by

185
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,240
Speaker 12:  purchasing some crypted coin, they would be able to

186
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,280
Speaker 12:  support crypted research and investigation.

187
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,760
Speaker 5:  You know, I was curious what exactly would the funding go toward?

188
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,880
Speaker 5:  Steven told me it's all about the latest technology.

189
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,920
Speaker 12:  We've got night vision cameras, we've got drones, we have motion sensor,

190
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,920
Speaker 12:  we have audio recorders, we have all the stuff that is

191
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,600
Speaker 12:  readily available within our budget. However, we would like to start

192
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,160
Speaker 12:  raising enough funding to get more, what I should I say,

193
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,040
Speaker 12:  advanced devices, military grade thermals, things like

194
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,840
Speaker 12:  that. You know, one of those incredible, you know, like flare gear that

195
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,040
Speaker 12:  they have on the Apaches and some of that stuff.

196
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,400
Speaker 5:  While talking to Steven, I started to see a similarity in the

197
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,280
Speaker 5:  discussions about both Bigfoot and Bitcoin. You know, like

198
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,960
Speaker 5:  if we had this amount of money, we can definitely hunt down Bigfoot.

199
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,280
Speaker 5:  If we figure out the layers in the payment stack, we can definitely make

200
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,680
Speaker 5:  Bitcoin work better. And Steven picked up on this too.

201
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,720
Speaker 5:  He said that when he talks to people about either subject, he gets similar

202
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,480
Speaker 5:  reactions.

203
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,920
Speaker 12:  Dude, I get rad all the time. You know, I get Raz all the time

204
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,080
Speaker 12:  about Bigfoots your fantasy. They're not real. They're a joke and this and

205
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,760
Speaker 12:  that thing. And then on the other hand, it's the same thing when I talk

206
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,240
Speaker 12:  to people about either crypto coin or cryptocurrency in general.

207
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,440
Speaker 12:  They think it's a joke, it's fake money and this and that,

208
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,400
Speaker 12:  and so there is a lot of that. They're just as skeptical about it because

209
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,920
Speaker 12:  they just think it's a flash in the pan.

210
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,040
Speaker 5:  In both crypto zoology and cryptocurrency, there are the

211
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,920
Speaker 5:  skeptics, there are the believers, and of course, not all believers of

212
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,600
Speaker 5:  one thing are believers of the other. Lauren Coleman is proof of that.

213
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,520
Speaker 5:  He's not minting messy NFTs. I also reached out to a few

214
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,320
Speaker 5:  cryptocurrency people on Twitter who use the word crypto in their names,

215
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,160
Speaker 5:  asking if they're also interested in crypto zoology finding

216
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,720
Speaker 5:  Bigfoot or the study of hidden or unknown animals.

217
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,100
Speaker 5:  No one replied to my query, but Sharon Hill who has

218
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,060
Speaker 5:  been tracking those spaces says it makes sense that people like Steven Major

219
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,740
Speaker 5:  are heavily invested in both cryptos.

220
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,220
Speaker 10:  Probably the most interesting similarity of these two crypto

221
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,020
Speaker 10:  communities is the significance, or I

222
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,180
Speaker 10:  might even say a comfort level in dealing with what we would

223
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,020
Speaker 10:  call liminal spaces. So that's the gap between the real and the

224
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,860
Speaker 10:  unreal, the light in the dark, the tangible and the abstract or

225
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,660
Speaker 10:  symbolic and how you comprehend that as part of your worldview. For example,

226
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,420
Speaker 10:  you know you have a crypted report. Is that report indicative of

227
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,860
Speaker 10:  people seeing a real animal or is it a hoax or is it

228
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,420
Speaker 10:  supernatural magical or ethereal, if you will?

229
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,380
Speaker 10:  Characteristics of popular crys are symbolic

230
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,380
Speaker 10:  and they manifest complex social concerns too.

231
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,140
Speaker 10:  So similarly, you've got cryptocurrency. Are these NFTs

232
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,540
Speaker 10:  real even though they are in tangible or are they

233
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,340
Speaker 10:  ephemeral that will vanish when you blink? So people

234
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,100
Speaker 10:  are are concerned about kind of similar factors of

235
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,900
Speaker 10:  these cryptos versus cryptocurrency things. Maybe both groups

236
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,620
Speaker 10:  have quite an unusual interest and ease about the

237
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,360
Speaker 10:  unknown and the hidden and what could come in the future.

238
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,560
Speaker 5:  So far, crypto coin has not taken off as well as Steven

239
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,840
Speaker 5:  had hoped. He told me he's pitched a lot of investors,

240
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,000
Speaker 5:  but with no luck of funding. But he still believes

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,920
Speaker 5:  cryptocurrency is the wave of the future and the technology is

242
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,720
Speaker 5:  here to stay. In the meantime, he continues his expeditions

243
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,000
Speaker 5:  into the wilderness of the Northwest United States and Canada

244
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,720
Speaker 5:  and producing documentaries about Bigfoot.

245
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,200
Speaker 12:  If I could get people that are really into cryptocurrency to get

246
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,040
Speaker 12:  interested in this, I think it would work. We wanna make believers

247
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,000
Speaker 12:  out of people, not only about Bigfoot being real, but cryptocurrency being

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,680
Speaker 12:  real as well.

249
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,760
Speaker 2:  All right, Andrew, thank you. Is cryptocurrency the big foot

250
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,640
Speaker 2:  of money? I don't know what that means, but it sounds good. Anyway, we're

251
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,920
Speaker 2:  gonna take a break and then we're gonna come back and we are going to talk

252
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,600
Speaker 2:  an awful lot about the iPad. We'll be right back.

253
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,640
Speaker 2:  new. You could imagine the world in which the iPad is like

254
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,400
Speaker 2:  the future of everything, but I don't think that's gonna happen, and

255
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,360
Speaker 2:  I think that that's because Apple specifically has absolutely

256
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,240
Speaker 2:  no idea what to do with the iPad to explain what I mean. We have to

257
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,120
Speaker 2:  talk about iPad OS and Stage Manager. Actually, no, hang on. Before

258
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,320
Speaker 2:  we do that, let's set the scene a little bit. I'm gonna talk a lot about

259
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,880
Speaker 2:  Stage Manager in a minute, but first I wanna play you a clip from the iPad's

260
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,400
Speaker 2:  original launch in 2010.

261
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,280
Speaker 14:  Is there room for a third category of device,

262
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,000
Speaker 14:  something that's between a laptop and a smartphone?

263
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,520
Speaker 2:  You can sort of picture it, right? Steve Jobs standing on a stage, he's in

264
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,480
Speaker 2:  jeans and a black turtleneck just like always, and he's explaining why Apple

265
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,520
Speaker 2:  wanted to build a tablet in the first place

266
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,920
Speaker 14:  In order to really create a new category of devices. Those devices are

267
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,160
Speaker 14:  gonna have to be far better at doing some key

268
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,000
Speaker 14:  tasks better than the laptop, better than the

269
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,440
Speaker 14:  smartphone. What kind of tasks? Well, things like

270
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,040
Speaker 14:  browsing the web. That's a pretty tall order. Something that's better at

271
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,760
Speaker 14:  browsing the web than a laptop. Doing email, enjoying and sharing

272
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,560
Speaker 14:  photographs, watching videos, enjoying your music collection,

273
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,400
Speaker 14:  playing games, reading eBooks. If there's gonna be a third

274
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,480
Speaker 14:  category of device, it's gonna have to be better at these kinds of tasks

275
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,240
Speaker 14:  than a laptop or a smartphone. Otherwise it has no reason for being.

276
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,760
Speaker 2:  And then a minute later, jobs sat down on stage in this

277
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,440
Speaker 2:  big comfy armchair and just started playing around with the device.

278
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,400
Speaker 2:  It was very comfortable and relaxed and he kept talking about how big the

279
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,160
Speaker 2:  screen was and how immersive it felt

280
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,840
Speaker 14:  Using this thing as remarkable, it's, it's so much more

281
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,040
Speaker 14:  intimate than a laptop and it's so much more capable than a

282
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,120
Speaker 14:  smartphone with this gorgeous large display.

283
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,360
Speaker 2:  Okay, to be fair, that was 12 years ago and a lot about the

284
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,280
Speaker 2:  iPad has changed mostly in good ways. The iPad is orders

285
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,240
Speaker 2:  of magnitude more powerful now. It has more apps, it has more accessories

286
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,080
Speaker 2:  including keyboards and Silas. And as it's gotten more powerful,

287
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,920
Speaker 2:  people have naturally wanted to do more with it because like Job

288
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,400
Speaker 2:  said, in some ways it is the best of both smartphone and laptop.

289
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,640
Speaker 2:  The iPad was initially this chill, immersive device for

290
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,480
Speaker 2:  browsing the web and playing music, but eventually the power users wanted

291
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,960
Speaker 2:  more. They wanted the iPad to be more like their laptop to even

292
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,600
Speaker 2:  replace their laptop. And that brings us to iPad o s 16

293
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,400
Speaker 2:  and brings us to Sage Manager. Sage Manager is,

294
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,840
Speaker 2:  how do I describe it? Let me just tell you what the screen looks like. The

295
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,400
Speaker 2:  feature is off by default, but when you turn it on, you get the app you're

296
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,760
Speaker 2:  looking at in the middle of the screen taking up, I don't know, three quarters

297
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,680
Speaker 2:  of the display. That space in the middle is known as the stage your dock

298
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,440
Speaker 2:  lives down at the bottom and off to the left, there are four thumbnails representing

299
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,360
Speaker 2:  the four apps you most recently used. These thumbnails are what Apple calls

300
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,880
Speaker 2:  piles, which is an amazing name for it, and you can have up to four apps

301
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,640
Speaker 2:  in each pile. Here's how Apple Software Chief Craig

302
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,280
Speaker 2:  Federighi described it at WWDC this year. He had just finished

303
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,120
Speaker 2:  introducing stage manager for Mac and then explained why it works on the

304
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,400
Speaker 2:  iPad too. Today,

305
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,760
Speaker 15:  On iPad when you use apps, you get the full screen

306
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,080
Speaker 15:  experience that we're all familiar with. Like in photos here

307
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,120
Speaker 15:  with Stage manager activated, I can now resize

308
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,960
Speaker 15:  Windows exposing a powerful new way to work with apps

309
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,920
Speaker 15:  on iPad and the doc is visible so I can easily get to all

310
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,640
Speaker 15:  my apps. Let's open music. You'll notice

311
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,400
Speaker 15:  that all my recently used apps appear on the left, so switching

312
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,160
Speaker 15:  between them is really fast and Stage Manager gives

313
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,000
Speaker 15:  me powerful new layout capabilities to create my ideal workspace

314
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,920
Speaker 15:  for the first time on iPad, I can work with overlapping windows.

315
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,720
Speaker 2:  The idea behind all this, if I'm gonna be really charitable to Apple here,

316
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,600
Speaker 2:  is to give you a quick way to move between the apps you use most. You can

317
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,320
Speaker 2:  have a pile with Slack in your email and then with one Tap jump to

318
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,920
Speaker 2:  another with your browser and Excel. That's a couple of taps faster

319
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,720
Speaker 2:  than swiping to go home or even swiping and holding to get to the app switcher.

320
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,440
Speaker 2:  And that's something. But here's the thing. The way Stage Manager works

321
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,320
Speaker 2:  makes absolutely no sense. Like none at all.

322
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,440
Speaker 2:  I've spent months now trying to figure out the mental model

323
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,800
Speaker 2:  of what goes where and I've got nothing for you.

324
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,200
Speaker 2:  Okay? So you open an app and it opens in Stage Manager that

325
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,120
Speaker 2:  kicks the fifth most recent pile out of stage manager because you can only

326
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,920
Speaker 2:  have four open at a time, but then if you reopen an app from that

327
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,840
Speaker 2:  old pile, it comes back into Stage manager along with the rest of its

328
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,720
Speaker 2:  pile. So that pile wasn't gone, it was just hidden and you

329
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,160
Speaker 2:  weren't allowed to find it. Somehow. If you have an app open in two piles,

330
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,880
Speaker 2:  there's no way to know which pile will open if you click a link to that app

331
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,600
Speaker 2:  and if you click a link in a pile, it might just take you to another pile

332
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,560
Speaker 2:  for no particular reason. You can't rename a pile or pin a pile and you

333
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,080
Speaker 2:  can't put one in your dock. You can't see piles by command tabbing between

334
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,000
Speaker 2:  them. They just kind of come and go and there's no rhyme or reason

335
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,760
Speaker 2:  to any of it.

336
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,920
Speaker 2:  The one exception is the app switcher, which interacts with Stage Manager

337
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,680
Speaker 2:  in a way that actually works. You swipe up and hold to open the view of all

338
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,840
Speaker 2:  your windows, which includes both your full screen apps and whatever piles

339
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,200
Speaker 2:  you've created. This works, this makes sense to me, but that view doesn't

340
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,040
Speaker 2:  match what's on the left side of stage manager and it should, I could

341
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,160
Speaker 2:  keep going on this forever, but let's just do a couple more. Say you decide

342
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,760
Speaker 2:  you wanna full screen a window, so you tap on the three button at the top

343
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,720
Speaker 2:  and you select Zoom. Sometimes nothing happens, just nothing, which is

344
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,640
Speaker 2:  weird, but even when the app does snap to full size, it still stays in

345
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,440
Speaker 2:  the pile. The only way to get it out of the pile is to tap on the three dots

346
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,960
Speaker 2:  and hit Minimize, which effectively hides the app. And then you go open the

347
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,360
Speaker 2:  app again and it's now separate, not minimizing, but sure,

348
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,520
Speaker 2:  but if you minimize a non full screen window, it sends that

349
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,400
Speaker 2:  app to its own pile but leaves it in stage manager. But it only

350
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,760
Speaker 2:  does that if there are other apps in the pile that you were currently using.

351
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,280
Speaker 2:  Does any of this make sense to you? Because it doesn't make any sense to

352
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,240
Speaker 2:  me at all. All of this is not even to mention

353
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,040
Speaker 2:  all the stuff about Stage Manager that is just fully broken. Apple

354
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,880
Speaker 2:  actually delayed the launch of iPad OS 16 in order to get it right, which

355
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,680
Speaker 2:  is why the public launch is actually version 16.1 and it's

356
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,280
Speaker 2:  still missing one of Stage manager's core features, which is using the software

357
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,160
Speaker 2:  on external displays. Big screens in theory would be even more useful for

358
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,800
Speaker 2:  Stage Manager, but we don't get that yet. And even after

359
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,640
Speaker 2:  all that extra work, it's nowhere close to ready. I've had

360
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,520
Speaker 2:  the onscreen keyboard randomly appear when I resized an app. I've had

361
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,240
Speaker 2:  apps crash as soon as I touch the bottom corner to resize them. There are

362
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,200
Speaker 2:  a million hilarious bugs everywhere. Apple's camera apps switches from landscape

363
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,000
Speaker 2:  to portrait as soon as you shrink the window and if you take your

364
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,360
Speaker 2:  iPad and you turn it to go from landscape to portrait mode and then back,

365
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,360
Speaker 2:  it resizes all your windows for some reason. Since you can resize apps,

366
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,400
Speaker 2:  developers have to make sure they look good at lots of different sizes. Some

367
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,040
Speaker 2:  of them really do imagine going from a landscape iPad to a portrait

368
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,360
Speaker 2:  iPad to an iPad mini to a big iPhone, to a small iPhone.

369
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,440
Speaker 2:  Some apps can handle all of those different sizes, but a lot of them

370
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,720
Speaker 2:  can't including a bunch of Apple apps. So you get this just

371
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,680
Speaker 2:  scrunched up view and it just looks bad. Again, I could keep

372
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,880
Speaker 2:  going on this for a really long time, but if you haven't figured it out by

373
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,640
Speaker 2:  now, I really don't like Sage Manager. It doesn't work very well and most

374
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,400
Speaker 2:  importantly it just doesn't make any sense. But the weirdest

375
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,560
Speaker 2:  thing about Sage Manager is that for the people who want more control over

376
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,080
Speaker 2:  how their apps appear on the screen, there is a better answer.

377
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,040
Speaker 2:  Users have been asking Apple for true free form multitasking

378
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,160
Speaker 2:  on the iPad like a Mac where you can just have windows wherever you want

379
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,120
Speaker 2:  them since basically the beginning of the iPad. And every time

380
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,040
Speaker 2:  Apple has even made so much as a gesture in the direction of

381
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,960
Speaker 2:  helping people do more at once, they freak out. Just listen to the

382
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,440
Speaker 2:  crowd in 2015 when Fedi mentions multitasking at

383
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,200
Speaker 2:  wwdc,

384
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,680
Speaker 15:  But now I want to turn to the big one and that's

385
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,600
Speaker 15:  multitasking.

386
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,160
Speaker 2:  They're cheering for multitasking. What a world

387
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,240
Speaker 2:  For a long time Apple's excuse for not offering true

388
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,560
Speaker 2:  do many things at once. Multitasking was that it was about performance and

389
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,440
Speaker 2:  battery life, which was fair enough. But now the iPad pros

390
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,000
Speaker 2:  run chips as powerful as MacBooks and they have plenty of battery life to

391
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,560
Speaker 2:  spare that excuse performance battery life just doesn't work

392
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,400
Speaker 2:  anymore. So what gives, here's my theory and it's the

393
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,240
Speaker 2:  only one that makes any sense to me. It's just that Apple doesn't want to

394
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,320
Speaker 2:  12 years after that first iPad. I think Apple still holds tightly

395
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,160
Speaker 2:  to the idea that the iPad is about focus, it's about simplicity. It's

396
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,120
Speaker 2:  about making your computing life easier, even if that means not letting you

397
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,840
Speaker 2:  do some things. One thing you have to understand is that when Apple talks

398
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,560
Speaker 2:  about multitasking on the iPad and iPhone, it doesn't mean what you think

399
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,440
Speaker 2:  it does. Apple has always used that word not to mean doing a bunch

400
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,400
Speaker 2:  of things at the same time. Actually, Jobs hated that idea. He believed

401
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,360
Speaker 2:  in focus above all else. He liked the idea of full screen apps.

402
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,160
Speaker 2:  What jobs in Apple actually meant by multitasking was quickly switching

403
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,320
Speaker 2:  between things and making sure those things were up to date. Here's jobs

404
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,000
Speaker 2:  introducing iOS four for instance.

405
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,160
Speaker 14:  So let's get into it. Let's start off with the first one, which is

406
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,520
Speaker 14:  probably going to be the biggest one and that is multitasking.

407
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:21,760
Speaker 14:  Tasking,

408
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,520
Speaker 2:  Again, the cheering people want multitasking Anyway, sorry,

409
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,080
Speaker 2:  back to

410
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,480
Speaker 14:  It. So here I am in mail. I'm gonna look at a mail message. This mail message

411
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Speaker 14:  has a, has a URL to a website. So I'm gonna go to that website and I

412
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,560
Speaker 14:  just click on it and I'm taken to the browser, right? So far this is what

413
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,480
Speaker 14:  we do every day on an iPhone and here I am at this Mount Kilimanjaro website.

414
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,560
Speaker 14:  Now I wanna go back to reading my mail. I'm done looking at this website.

415
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,400
Speaker 14:  What do I do? I can navigate back to the home screen and then click on mail

416
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,240
Speaker 14:  again. But rather than that I can just double click the home button and

417
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,160
Speaker 14:  the window raises up and it shows me all the apps that are running. These

418
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,800
Speaker 14:  are all the apps that are running and I wanna go back to mail and I go right

419
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,640
Speaker 14:  back to where I left it. I wanna go back to that webpage. There I am

420
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,680
Speaker 14:  right back at the webpage. Very simple.

421
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,640
Speaker 2:  What jobs describes there is not multitasking, it's not even

422
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,480
Speaker 2:  close. That is task switching and that is what Apple has

423
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,080
Speaker 2:  always meant when it says multitasking. Things like getting calls when you're

424
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,600
Speaker 2:  in other apps or playing music in the background, that's the closest to true

425
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,240
Speaker 2:  multitasking Apple ever wanted. Actually Apple talked about

426
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,120
Speaker 2:  Siri as a big multitasking win. It's a way to do quick things without losing

427
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,840
Speaker 2:  focus on the thing you're actually doing. And over the years, even as Apple

428
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,800
Speaker 2:  has embraced the idea that the iPad is a productivity tool that you can and

429
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,600
Speaker 2:  should use it to do real work, whatever that means to you, it's still

430
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,160
Speaker 2:  trying to hold on to that same idea. The iPad can't

431
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,040
Speaker 2:  multitask, truly multitask because Apple thinks it shouldn't,

432
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,080
Speaker 2:  but it also kind of thinks that it should and a lot of people want it

433
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,040
Speaker 2:  to. And so everything is kind of a mess. Let me go back to Fedi for a

434
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,680
Speaker 2:  second at an interview he did for John Gruber's talk show podcast right after

435
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,560
Speaker 2:  this year's wwdc because he says something I think is incredibly

436
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,480
Speaker 2:  telling. Stage Manager was built for the Mac, he says, and only came to

437
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,280
Speaker 2:  the iPad later.

438
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,520
Speaker 15:  The Mac experience is messy by default, right? You open one thing

439
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,120
Speaker 15:  and then you go to get the next thing and it piles on top of that mess and

440
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,000
Speaker 15:  you go the next thing, you pile on top that mess. And so,

441
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,120
Speaker 2:  Okay, let's skip ahead of it. He talks about this for a while. Here's the

442
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,440
Speaker 2:  iPad explanation. It

443
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,920
Speaker 15:  Was truly coincidental. I have to say that we found

444
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,680
Speaker 15:  ourselves coming from a completely different direction with

445
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:33,800
Speaker 15:  iPad and realizing they arrived at the same place. And

446
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,200
Speaker 15:  it was, it was almost weird when that happened. But we realized with iPad

447
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,080
Speaker 15:  you had what was a clean experience by default, single window at a time.

448
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,680
Speaker 15:  Time, but where you wanted to be able to bring in more, have more

449
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,240
Speaker 15:  access to things, more multitasking. So we were able to capture part of

450
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,880
Speaker 15:  the spirit of the iPad and yet open it up in such a huge way

451
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,760
Speaker 15:  to overlapping windows. That broader sense of access for

452
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,480
Speaker 15:  multitasking.

453
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,680
Speaker 2:  One half of that equation makes total sense to me. The Mac does

454
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,480
Speaker 2:  get messy. It's true. And giving you some structure on top of that

455
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,360
Speaker 2:  can be useful. It's why people like spaces or think of like the

456
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,480
Speaker 2:  Stacks feature on the Mac, the one where you can right click on your desktop

457
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,440
Speaker 2:  and have it automatically make folders for all the different types of files

458
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,160
Speaker 2:  you have. It's great, right? It doesn't force you to work a specific way,

459
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,840
Speaker 2:  it just kind of helps you clean up. That doesn't work on an

460
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,200
Speaker 2:  iPad. The iPad is already much more iPhone than Mac.

461
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:29,240
Speaker 2:  It's already controlled and structured and it has so many guardrails

462
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,160
Speaker 2:  that actually stage manager is just more structure on all of that

463
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,800
Speaker 2:  structure. Now you have a million different ways to do everything and none

464
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,640
Speaker 2:  of them just give you control. Yes, Stage manager lets you have

465
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,400
Speaker 2:  overlapping windows and that's nice, but it's too complicated for simple

466
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,320
Speaker 2:  use cases and it's not nearly powerful enough for the real power

467
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,280
Speaker 2:  user stuff because Apple is trying to make the iPad all things

468
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,000
Speaker 2:  to all people because it can do so much, so many different ways.

469
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,080
Speaker 2:  It tried to make something that is both super focused and simple and

470
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,400
Speaker 2:  super powerful and versatile and that just turns out to be

471
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,360
Speaker 2:  impossible. And so Stage Manager is kind of a bad idea, badly

472
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,720
Speaker 2:  implemented and as you'll see with the iPad lineup this year,

473
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,520
Speaker 2:  confusion is a bit of a theme. What is the iPad?

474
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,160
Speaker 2:  Who is it for? How are you supposed to use it? Apple's answer

475
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,920
Speaker 2:  used to be very clear. Now it's all about choice and

476
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,040
Speaker 2:  versatility and you can do anything with it any way you want. I think

477
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,000
Speaker 2:  that's a bad answer and I think Apple needs better ones quickly. But

478
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,640
Speaker 2:  we'll get to all of that in just a second. First a break, we'll be right

479
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:33,800
Speaker 2:  back.

480
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,990
Speaker 18:  Everyone is raving about my policeman to all

481
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,950
Speaker 19:  Of us. To all of us

482
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,470
Speaker 18:  Critics call it a powerful story of forbidden love.

483
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,830
Speaker 19:  Come with me just you and I,

484
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,910
Speaker 18:  I dunno what's happening. You have to be careful. An emotional journey of

485
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,710
Speaker 18:  desire and regret. He's trying to destroy our marriage, sweeping

486
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,070
Speaker 18:  and romantic. So how does

487
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,870
Speaker 19:  It make you feel? I pity people who dunno what it feels like to be this

488
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,110
Speaker 19:  in

489
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,950
Speaker 18:  Love. My policeman ready are on 17 nine, The Middle Without Pair

492

Speaker 20:  super fast. They do a B minus job vacuuming our homes. They

506
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,900
Speaker 2:  Welcome back Apple is about to start selling a couple of new

507
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,820
Speaker 2:  iPads. There's the 10th generation iPad model, the base model which has some

508
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,340
Speaker 2:  new colors

509
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,420
Speaker 2:  lineup is kind of losing its mind. The verges Dan Seifert

510
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,540
Speaker 2:  and Monica Chin have been writing about and viewing these devices over the

511
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,940
Speaker 2:  last couple of weeks. So we're gonna get into trying to make sense of this

512
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,860
Speaker 2:  lineup and which one might be for you. Dan? Hello.

513
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,140
Speaker 2:  Hello Monica. Hello. Hello. Thank you both for doing this.

514
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,340
Speaker 2:  I feel like we've all been in insane iPad chaos hell

515
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,180
Speaker 2:  for the last week or so. So I'm sorry for putting you through this again,

516
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:38,100
Speaker 2:  but thank you for being here. Anything for you David? So my

517
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,860
Speaker 2:  goal here is basically like I just wanna try and help people

518
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,740
Speaker 2:  figure out if you wanna buy an iPad, which one should you buy?

519
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,700
Speaker 2:  And I feel like I've had a bunch of like heuristics for this over the years

520
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,980
Speaker 2:  where it was like okay if you, if you just wanted an iPad but you wanted

521
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,260
Speaker 2:  it only for very simple things, I was like perfect, just buy the base level

522
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,700
Speaker 2:  iPad $329, you'll be very happy, it'll be great if you wanna like

523
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,900
Speaker 2:  do stuff. I mostly recommended people by the air and then if

524
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,900
Speaker 2:  it was like if you are a person who knows you wanna pro buy a pro, you'll

525
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,900
Speaker 2:  probably love it. Now I feel like everything is like wildly

526
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,460
Speaker 2:  massively up in the air.

527
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Speaker 21:  Everyone should just own an iPad mini end of story.

528
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,860
Speaker 2:  We're done if I'm honest, that's my actual answer. It's the

529
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,380
Speaker 2:  wrong answer but, but that is how I feel in my heart. But Dan let's start

530
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,340
Speaker 2:  with you actually cuz you just reviewed the iPad 10th generation which is

531
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,220
Speaker 2:  like yes ostensibly the default iPad. It should be

532
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,900
Speaker 2:  the one that if it is like I want an iPad and I want to answer no follow

533
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,700
Speaker 2:  up questions, the answer should be the 10th generation iPad

534
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,000
Speaker 2:  but you, you just reviewed it, what's the verdict? How do you feel

535
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,880
Speaker 21:  The verdict is? It should be the default iPad but I don't think it's

536
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,560
Speaker 21:  the right iPad for basically anyone that's not really a knock

537
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,200
Speaker 21:  against the device itself because in a vacuum the Tension

538
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,280
Speaker 21:  iPad is a really great tablet, performs really well, it's got reliable Battery

539
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,920
Speaker 21:  Life has all the iPad apps, the screen is good if not perfect,

540
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,000
Speaker 21:  it's got a new updated design, the sound is really good, all that kind of

541
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,600
Speaker 21:  stuff. And so like it's hard to like knock the device itself but when you

542
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,320
Speaker 21:  put it in the context of like Apple's iPad lineup, it's like

543
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,640
Speaker 21:  too expensive for what it is if you are really price sensitive

544
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,440
Speaker 21:  and then it is like not nice enough to

545
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,280
Speaker 21:  put up a good fight against the iPad air, which is like the next level up.

546
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,200
Speaker 21:  So it's like kind of this weird in between spot and I'm

547
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,080
Speaker 21:  sure Apple wanted to bring that in at a lower price but like right

548
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,600
Speaker 21:  now the way it's priced at it's just a really tough sell.

549
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,440
Speaker 21:  Especially because the entry level iPad that you just mentioned, it's still

550
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,120
Speaker 21:  available, it's still being sold. So if you're really price sensitive

551
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,720
Speaker 21:  there's a lot of reasons to just buy that one, which is still a really good

552
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,640
Speaker 21:  tablet. Like it's not a bad tablet at all. It's a great iPad.

553
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Monica, I'm curious what you think too cuz your perspective on this

554
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,360
Speaker 2:  is super interesting and that you come at it from like a should you buy a

555
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,840
Speaker 2:  $500 laptop or should you buy an iPad kind of thing. And I feel like

556
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,640
Speaker 2:  like reading your reviews always it's been like well if you just wanna do

557
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,680
Speaker 2:  basic stuff like maybe you should consider buying an iPad and you wrote last

558
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,400
Speaker 2:  week and my sense would be having now like seen these things in the wild

559
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,840
Speaker 2:  and dance review experience and all that stuff that like this has sort of

560
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,400
Speaker 2:  confirmed your priors that this is now like a mid-level laptop that is maybe

561
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,480
Speaker 2:  not the mid-level laptop you should buy.

562
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,160
Speaker 22:  Yeah, what I would say David, is there is a big difference and I recognize

563
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,640
Speaker 22:  that some amount of this difference is psychological but it is there

564
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,400
Speaker 22:  nonetheless between $329 and

565
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,680
Speaker 22:  $449.

566
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,640
Speaker 2:  Oh absolutely

567
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,600
Speaker 22:  $329 to me is a very fine, I will

568
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,320
Speaker 22:  buy this for my kids or I will buy this to just like watch

569
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,520
Speaker 22:  the watcher on but like everything else I do on my computer,

570
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,680
Speaker 22:  $329 for that is fine. $449

571
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,920
Speaker 22:  just seems like too much. And like if that were just me, that'd be

572
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,840
Speaker 22:  one thing. But I think most people think that $449

573
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,280
Speaker 22:  is getting to the point where that is too expensive for a device for

574
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,120
Speaker 22:  which like those two things are the primary use case and

575
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,000
Speaker 22:  that's without adding the keyboard. Which like if you wanna buy the

576
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,600
Speaker 22:  keyboard that's another $250 at that point you're at 700.

577
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:07,520
Speaker 22:  Like I can give you like tons and tons of laptops you can buy for 700.

578
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,360
Speaker 22:  Right? You know it's like the three $29 iPad nine has been a

579
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,240
Speaker 22:  real like pain for me as a reviewer frankly because every time I

580
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,480
Speaker 22:  review a budget thing I have to caveat like well you could buy this or you

581
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,280
Speaker 22:  could buy $329 thing. And when someone asked me like Oh I want

582
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,160
Speaker 22:  something under you know $600, what should I buy? It was hard for me to

583
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,960
Speaker 22:  come up with an alternative to that $29 iPad nine. The more

584
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,360
Speaker 22:  you increase the price because price is like the main benefit of these things

585
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,400
Speaker 22:  when you put them up against laptops, right? The higher that price goes,

586
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,040
Speaker 22:  the easier it is for me to come up with something else that I can recommend

587
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,920
Speaker 22:  to you as a budget shopper and especially at 450

588
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,440
Speaker 22:  but going up to 700 it is way easier for me to come up with small alternatives.

589
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,360
Speaker 21:  Yeah and it's important to note that like these iPads are great

590
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,200
Speaker 21:  tablets but not great laptops. Like you can add

591
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,600
Speaker 21:  the keyboard to them and you can get keyboard cases for them, but ultimately

592
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,560
Speaker 21:  it's a really small screen to try and like spend a lot of time

593
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,440
Speaker 21:  working on. They are limited in how many, you know, apps

594
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,120
Speaker 21:  you can run side by side and things like that. And so the, the higher end

595
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,920
Speaker 21:  iPads do have things like stage manager which we kind of have

596
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,480
Speaker 21:  established as not in a great position now. Yes. But it's an idea for better

597
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,080
Speaker 21:  multitasking. They have the ability to scale their screen down differently

598
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,760
Speaker 21:  so you can fit more stuff on the screen and makes it easier to multitask

599
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,480
Speaker 21:  and stuff like that. These are really like if you're trying to like do laptop,

600
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,320
Speaker 21:  like work with it, it's very light laptop work, sending a few emails, reading

601
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,240
Speaker 21:  a couple of things, you know stuff like that. Not really like spending

602
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,600
Speaker 21:  all day

603
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,080
Speaker 22:  On it. I do wanna add to that too that this, I'm not trying to say here

604
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,000
Speaker 22:  that the fact that the iPad is so limited like is an insult to anyone who

605
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,840
Speaker 22:  loves the iPad cause this is like something that's been a big deal on Twitter

606
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,080
Speaker 22:  with some people. Like I have lots of devices that I own that I love that

607
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,920
Speaker 22:  I think are great and I also don't think they should cost $700.

608
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,320
Speaker 2:  Yes a hundred percent. Well this goes to like my basic conundrum which is

609
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,200
Speaker 2:  like my, my general stance on most technology now

610
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,360
Speaker 2:  is like buy the best thing you can afford and upgrade as rarely as possible,

611
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,240
Speaker 2:  right? Buy the nicest thing you can figure out and then keep it as long as

612
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,040
Speaker 2:  you possibly can and that is like a happy way to live your technological

613
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,200
Speaker 2:  life. Whereas if you just keep buying crappy stuff you're just gonna have

614
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,680
Speaker 2:  to keep buying crappy stuff and that sucks. But I'm kind of at a point now

615
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,320
Speaker 2:  where it seems to me like last year's

616
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,920
Speaker 2:  $329 iPad is probably

617
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,080
Speaker 2:  still the right choice If you're just a person who wants an iPad.

618
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,680
Speaker 2:  Like I, I certainly don't imagine there's any particular like

619
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,560
Speaker 2:  performance issues. It has a now two generations old chip or

620
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,040
Speaker 2:  maybe more than that Jesus if you include the Amchis but like it's still

621
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,000
Speaker 2:  faster than you need Dan to your point to like check your email and browse

622
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,600
Speaker 2:  the internet. The camera's pretty good. It has touch ID and Lightning, both

623
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,480
Speaker 2:  of which are old And so I end up like spinning out of control where it's

624
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,280
Speaker 2:  like okay this thing is going to be obsolete faster than some of these other

625
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,080
Speaker 2:  devices. So I'm like reluctant to tell people to buy it but also for

626
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,680
Speaker 2:  all the things most people want to do on their iPads, it's still

627
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,480
Speaker 2:  plenty right now and I think the new iPad is both

628
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,400
Speaker 2:  too expensive and in certain ways like overkill for that

629
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,320
Speaker 2:  stuff. I don't know, this is the part I can't figure out.

630
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,720
Speaker 21:  There's multiple like components here. Right? So you mentioned the processor

631
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,360
Speaker 21:  in performance. One thing that really struck me with reviewing this

632
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,120
Speaker 21:  iPad 10.9 or 10th gen iPad recently is that I

633
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,080
Speaker 21:  typically use an M one iPad Pro that's like my personal iPad. I

634
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,960
Speaker 21:  use it all the time. I'm very familiar with how it works. I reviewed earlier

635
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,640
Speaker 21:  this year the iPad air with the M one and then I'm reviewing the iPad

636
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,000
Speaker 21:  10th gen with an A 14, an arguably lower end ship.

637
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,800
Speaker 21:  But I couldn't find an appreciable difference in performance

638
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,920
Speaker 21:  in all the things that I do on my iPad. Whether I'm zooming with colleagues

639
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,720
Speaker 21:  or I'm in Slack or I'm bouncing between tasks or I'm opening multiple

640
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,360
Speaker 21:  tabs or I'm writing the review on the iPad itself, whatever it is,

641
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,080
Speaker 21:  all of my typical office productivity work is like not limited

642
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,040
Speaker 21:  by the processor, it's limited by the OS but it's not the processor. So

643
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,440
Speaker 21:  it's like you have all these different levels of processor performance in

644
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,040
Speaker 21:  the iPad but I'd be very hard pressed to be if most people could be able

645
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,920
Speaker 21:  to tell the difference between the different iPads. There are other quality

646
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,640
Speaker 21:  of life things, the air and the pro have nicer screens and that's immediately

647
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,800
Speaker 21:  noticeable and I think that's, if it is something that you care about, it

648
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Speaker 21:  is a very important thing. That screen is arguably the most important part

649
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,760
Speaker 21:  of a tablet. It's the thing you're looking at the most and interacting with

650
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,320
Speaker 21:  the most. It's the whole

651
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,040
Speaker 2:  Reason it exists.

652
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,880
Speaker 21:  Yeah it is worth paying for a little bit nicer screen if you care that much

653
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,760
Speaker 21:  but then like if you're not particular about that then

654
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,680
Speaker 21:  the ninth gen has a little bit of a smaller screen but it's so

655
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,560
Speaker 21:  much less expensive And I, there's other things that it does have that

656
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,160
Speaker 21:  the 10th gen doesn't have and I think a big one at this price point for

657
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,880
Speaker 21:  this type of device is the headphone jack. We've kind of like gotten away

658
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,000
Speaker 21:  from like complaining about no headphone jacks on phones because we had

659
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,520
Speaker 21:  to accept that there are basically no phones without with headphone jacks

660
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,880
Speaker 21:  anymore And like we have to live in that reality. But tablets are a very

661
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,520
Speaker 21:  different product and they have a different type of consumer

662
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,640
Speaker 21:  or user and a lot of the users of a base iPad are kids

663
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,200
Speaker 21:  whether they're at home or they're at school or whatever it is

664
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,120
Speaker 21:  and they don't have their own AirPods and their own Bluetooth headphones

665
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,920
Speaker 21:  and things like that. They're using wired headphones because it's easy.

666
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,640
Speaker 21:  You can get sound limiting ones, which is a big thing for a lot of parents

667
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,920
Speaker 21:  that you can limit the volume with and so kids aren't blowing their ears

668
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,960
Speaker 21:  out and you could do that over a standard 3.5 millimeter headphones jack

669
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,560
Speaker 21:  if schools are sharing an iPad, I know that I can speak for like my kids,

670
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,200
Speaker 21:  we send them to school with their own headphones and they use share devices

671
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,680
Speaker 21:  and plug their headphones into them. Right. You can't do that if you don't

672
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,200
Speaker 21:  have a headphones Jack. You can't give everyone a dongle or expect everyone

673
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,120
Speaker 21:  to pair their headphones to it. Yeah, like it just, it's like a really frustrating

674
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,440
Speaker 21:  limitation. So in this context I think a headphone jack is actually a lot

675
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,080
Speaker 21:  of value. The other part of it is if you're giving this device to a kid,

676
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,720
Speaker 21:  they're probably gonna break it at some point. Yes. And that goes back to

677
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,240
Speaker 21:  Monica's point about the price that $450 price

678
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,200
Speaker 21:  versus $329 and realistic in the real world, most people are

679
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,120
Speaker 21:  not paying $329 for that iPad. It's been out long enough that it's easy

680
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,000
Speaker 21:  to find for 2 79 or maybe even two 50 if you hunt a little bit. That's a

681
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,720
Speaker 21:  huge difference. If you think, you know, this kid's gonna break it in a

682
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Speaker 21:  year and I gotta replace it or repair it or whatever it is. Like it just

683
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,840
Speaker 21:  doesn't make sense to be spending that extra money If you're buying something

684
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,360
Speaker 21:  for yourself, that's a different story if you're like, you know looking

685
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,720
Speaker 21:  for yourself. But then I would say look at the iPad air, it's that much

686
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,600
Speaker 21:  closer in price to the standard, the 10th gen iPad and has a nicer

687
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,800
Speaker 21:  screen and we didn't even talk about like the pencil situations got nicer

688
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,320
Speaker 21:  accessories options there and it has an even faster processor which

689
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,960
Speaker 21:  might last longer in terms of like future support and updates

690
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,880
Speaker 21:  and other new features coming down the

691
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,080
Speaker 22:  Road. What I would add to that too from the perspec, from like the childless

692
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,840
Speaker 22:  adult perspective is I think there's maybe something to be said for like

693
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,680
Speaker 22:  there's probably some constituency of people who's interested

694
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,440
Speaker 22:  in paying a premium for like a slightly more modern look and

695
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,960
Speaker 22:  speaking between the ninth gen and the 10th Jen, I do think though that

696
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,920
Speaker 22:  if I were a budget shopper myself who was in the base iPad's target

697
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,960
Speaker 22:  audience, I'd be buying the 3 29 over the 4 49 right now. And I also think

698
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,880
Speaker 22:  another option I'd have would be to wait for the 4 49 to come down

699
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,480
Speaker 22:  to 3 29 because that's something to, to dance point about. Being able to

700
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,360
Speaker 22:  find deals currently on the 3 29 1, like the 4 49 ones

701
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,440
Speaker 22:  price is very likely to fall in the future.

702
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,400
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Like I'm sitting here trying

703
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,000
Speaker 2:  to figure out how to play devil's advocate and like advocate for the

704
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,400
Speaker 2:  more expensive iPad. Cause I think one of the things I have had to learn

705
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,040
Speaker 2:  the hard way over time is that Apple buyers are less price sensitive than

706
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,960
Speaker 2:  I think they are And Apple has like continued to press that fact

707
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,080
Speaker 2:  over and over and over again. They're, they're raising the prices of services,

708
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,280
Speaker 2:  they're raising the prices of hardware and like people just keep buying their

709
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,960
Speaker 2:  stuff because they make good stuff and people like it and, but even in this

710
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,880
Speaker 2:  case, like I just, I'm not sure other than the design which I think

711
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,720
Speaker 2:  is noticeably better from the ninth gen to the 10, I can't really think of

712
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,640
Speaker 2:  a thing that is going to be like meaningfully better in people's lives in

713
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,280
Speaker 2:  the new one.

714
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,000
Speaker 21:  Yeah, I mean this screen's a little bigger. Yeah, it's, it's 0.7 inch bigger.

715
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,360
Speaker 21:  So that kind of goes hand in hand with the design. But I don't think that

716
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,160
Speaker 21:  the processor difference is appreciable. I don't think having 5G is an option

717
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,120
Speaker 21:  is appreciable because most people buying this level iPad are not adding

718
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,800
Speaker 21:  cellular because that's another $150 surcharge. Plus you have to pay for

719
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,560
Speaker 21:  the service. So if you are in the type that is going to pay for

720
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,280
Speaker 21:  cellular connectivity on it, you're probably looking at an error or above

721
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,000
Speaker 21:  anyways cuz you're in that higher end market. So these other features are

722
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,920
Speaker 21:  just like not adding value outside of the design is

723
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,560
Speaker 21:  nicer and the screen's a little bigger and for the price difference, that's

724
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,160
Speaker 21:  a really tough sell.

725
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,120
Speaker 2:  All right, so let's talk about the error actually because when these things

726
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,000
Speaker 2:  first came out, my immediate reaction was like, why does

727
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,880
Speaker 2:  the air still exist? Because it was always the like a

728
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,200
Speaker 2:  little bit of a tweener and a little bit of the best of both worlds depending

729
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,120
Speaker 2:  on how you looked at it. It was like it, it was right in that middle spot

730
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,880
Speaker 2:  of like it's, it's pretty good and pretty expensive and do it that would

731
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,480
Speaker 2:  you will now it's $150 more

732
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,520
Speaker 2:  than the iPad 10. But like you said Dan, it has this better screen,

733
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:58,640
Speaker 2:  it has support for the newest pencil. It has I

734
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,600
Speaker 2:  think the same camera, it has the M one chip instead of the A 14 bionic

735
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,240
Speaker 2:  chip, which a lot of people got really up in arms again about. But again,

736
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,560
Speaker 2:  I think there's like, this isn't, these things aren't gonna be meaningful

737
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,760
Speaker 2:  to most people. Like the A 14 bionic is gonna be plenty and so is the M one,

738
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,640
Speaker 2:  the M two, like God help you if you are maxing out the performance of the

739
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,840
Speaker 2:  M two M two chip on the new pro. But we'll get to that. Is there a, is there

740
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,360
Speaker 2:  a case for the air as kind of still that like good tweener?

741
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,520
Speaker 21:  I think the air is actually the most compelling iPad

742
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,360
Speaker 21:  for a lot of people and I think that if you are are buying an iPad, you're

743
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,120
Speaker 21:  falling into two brackets, you're, you're falling into the one that we've

744
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,080
Speaker 21:  discussed extensively. The budget buyer who is just buying a basic iPad

745
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,600
Speaker 21:  for iPad things or you are, you are that customer that you mentioned earlier

746
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,040
Speaker 21:  that is like not as price sensitive, is willing to pay more and the air

747
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,600
Speaker 21:  actually gives you noticeable, appreciative, better experience and better

748
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,240
Speaker 21:  options for the future. Whether you want to add the pencil or add the better

749
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,160
Speaker 21:  keyboard or there are features coming down the road that will support

750
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,920
Speaker 21:  the M one but not the A 14 processor. So like if

751
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,280
Speaker 21:  you are in that space, I think the error is actually a really good value.

752
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,040
Speaker 21:  It gives you basically the same performance as the pro. It gives you the

753
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,920
Speaker 21:  same size as the pro. It gives you the same ability to connect

754
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,640
Speaker 21:  to external displays as the pro. It gives you the same ability to connect

755
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,960
Speaker 21:  peripherals as the pro and it has the same accessory ecosystem as

756
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,360
Speaker 21:  the pro and it has almost as good of a screen. Really the only difference

757
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,240
Speaker 21:  between the screens, between the air and the PRO is promotion, which is

758
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,480
Speaker 21:  the higher refresh rate, but you're still getting laminated display, you're

759
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,680
Speaker 21:  still getting P three color gamut. It's noticeably nicer. You put it side

760
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,400
Speaker 21:  by side with a 10th gen iPad and it's very obvious which one is a better

761
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,560
Speaker 21:  screen. And so like all of those things are much better quality of life.

762
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,240
Speaker 21:  If you are going to buy an iPad, maybe you're considering, you know, replacing

763
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,240
Speaker 21:  your iPad or your laptop with it, maybe you're looking for a third device

764
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,480
Speaker 21:  they use on the go commuting. Maybe you are buying the cellular connectivity,

765
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,840
Speaker 21:  maybe you're planning to keep it for five years or more. I think that the

766
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,960
Speaker 21:  air is actually a really compelling option at this point. And especially

767
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,720
Speaker 21:  as we were just saying, like you can get the ninth gen on sale, you could

768
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,240
Speaker 21:  get the air on sale too, and it's a lot closer to the 10 gen price when

769
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,720
Speaker 21:  it's on sale. So it's like a $70 difference. And at that point it's a no

770
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,400
Speaker 21:  brainer to me by the air. Forget about the 10 gen,

771
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:09,360
Speaker 22:  I mean, I agree that the big benefit of the air is better accessory compatibility.

772
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:13,560
Speaker 22:  I just wish they would give that to the iPad 10 and at that point I think

773
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,120
Speaker 22:  it would make more sense as a buy.

774
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,200
Speaker 21:  Yeah, it's, it's kind of a weird position though, right? Because like it's

775
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,760
Speaker 21:  super weird that the iPad 10 does not support the second gen pencil. Like

776
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,600
Speaker 21:  it supports the first gen pencil and has this weird umbilical charging situation.

777
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,520
Speaker 21:  It's a mess. And then the keyboard accessory for it is a $250 keyboard

778
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,080
Speaker 21:  accessory that's only compatible with the tension air. It's not compatible

779
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,360
Speaker 21:  with the air or attention iPad, excuse me, not compatible with the air or

780
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,040
Speaker 21:  the pro, but that keyboard accessory is already really expensive

781
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,720
Speaker 21:  and the keyboard accessory for the air and for the pro is even more expensive

782
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,080
Speaker 21:  and the second gen pencil is even more expensive. So now it's like if you

783
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,760
Speaker 21:  are wanting to kid out your iPad and like do the whole thing,

784
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,800
Speaker 21:  get the whole experience, are you gonna spend $300 on a keyboard for

785
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,760
Speaker 21:  a $450 tablet? That doesn't seem like a great equation to me. Or

786
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,600
Speaker 21:  $130 on a pencil for your $450

787
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Speaker 21:  tablet. Like it just makes sense to me that like if you're adding those

788
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,440
Speaker 21:  accessories, you're adding them to the nicer iPad. I agree that it would

789
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,280
Speaker 21:  be great if these were all cross compatible, it would eliminate a lot of

790
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,600
Speaker 21:  confusion, but I just can't see a lot of people actually going for that

791
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,960
Speaker 21:  deal on the 10 gen iPad.

792
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,920
Speaker 2:  I agree. But the keyboard lineup to me is the single most insane thing

793
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,880
Speaker 2:  about the way that the iPads work right now. There are smart keyboards and

794
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,440
Speaker 2:  there are magic keyboards and there are folios and there are non folios.

795
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,120
Speaker 2:  And the fact that there is a thing called the magic keyboard folio that only

796
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,160
Speaker 2:  works on the iPad 10 and nothing else is stupid like to

797
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,640
Speaker 2:  your point, it's ridiculous and, and Apple has this very simple

798
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,440
Speaker 2:  opportunity to unify some of the things that it has going on and like

799
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,200
Speaker 2:  there were a bunch of people who, you know, wrote these stories explaining

800
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:45,200
Speaker 2:  that where the magnet would go for the Apple Pencil two on the iPad 10

801
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,040
Speaker 2:  generation is actually where the camera is in the center

802
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,200
Speaker 2:  on in landscape mode now and all these things and it's like this is all well

803
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,640
Speaker 2:  and good but this is just like, this is so deeply like un

804
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,520
Speaker 2:  apple-like to be this complicated and make me like draw a diagram

805
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,960
Speaker 2:  of which keyboard works for for which thing. The

806
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,920
Speaker 21:  Strangest part of that is that the 10th gen looks identical to the air

807
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,800
Speaker 21:  and basically identical to the pro. And so you would look at

808
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,520
Speaker 21:  it and you'd be like, oh these can use all the same things together. Like

809
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,640
Speaker 21:  the ninth gen looks different and you could be like, oh I can understand

810
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,480
Speaker 21:  it doesn't fit that keyboard case because it looks different and it's a

811
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,800
Speaker 21:  different size. This is like within a millimeter of the size of the air

812
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,360
Speaker 21:  in every dimension has the same size screen as the same overall design.

813
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,880
Speaker 21:  It doesn't make a ton of sense that they did not make it compatible with

814
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,520
Speaker 21:  the same accessories.

815
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,920
Speaker 2:  Agreed. If Apple could figure out how to get the new pencil on the iPad mini,

816
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,840
Speaker 2:  they could have figured out how to do it on the iPad tent generation. But

817
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,760
Speaker 2:  Monica, here's my thing about the air. So the air is 5 99, but

818
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,680
Speaker 2:  if you go, if you go all in and you, you like get the Apple pencil and the

819
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,240
Speaker 2:  magic keyboard, this thing is 1020 $7

820
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,360
Speaker 2:  and you, the other thing you could buy for that money is a MacBook heir.

821
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,840
Speaker 2:  And I think a lot of the people who are just making this particular decision

822
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,280
Speaker 2:  are literally going to be deciding between those two things. I, I don't know

823
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,880
Speaker 2:  what's your sense of how you would even explain that to people? Like if you're

824
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,160
Speaker 2:  gonna spend a thousand dollars, are you gonna spend it on like what feels

825
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,880
Speaker 2:  like kind of a super expensive tablet or Apple's

826
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,640
Speaker 2:  like increasingly extremely good entry level laptop?

827
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,160
Speaker 22:  I mean I'd just get an air,

828
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,560
Speaker 2:  To be fair, that could have meant either one that's the MacBook Air and the

829
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,080
Speaker 2:  iPad Air.

830
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:21,120
Speaker 22:  I would get the MacBook Air. Okay. Just because I think at that price you

831
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,920
Speaker 22:  should get an operating system that can do what Mac

832
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:28,320
Speaker 22:  Os can do. Again, this doesn't mean that I, I'm not trying to insult people

833
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,000
Speaker 22:  who love to use iPad os like I think it's great, I love to use it myself.

834
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,680
Speaker 22:  I think there are great use cases for it but Mac OS can just do

835
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:39,680
Speaker 22:  a lot more and I think the two are not worth

836
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,880
Speaker 22:  the same amount of money.

837
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,680
Speaker 21:  I think it's very interesting that if we were having this conversation three

838
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,480
Speaker 21:  years ago, it'd be a very different dynamic and the thing

839
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,360
Speaker 21:  that's happened is MacBooks got good again and now that they are

840
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,960
Speaker 21:  so good it's made the iPad a lot less compelling. Yes. So we had all these

841
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,520
Speaker 21:  years where it was like, oh the iPad is the future of computing. Apple's

842
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,720
Speaker 21:  really pushing the iPad as it's as it's like next level

843
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,520
Speaker 21:  and it's getting all the features before they, the MacBooks would and the

844
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,320
Speaker 21:  MacBooks had terrible battery life and they ran hot and things like that

845
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,040
Speaker 21:  and then the arm transition happened and MacBooks got good again, whether

846
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,360
Speaker 21:  you got the air or the pro, you know you're getting a really great computer

847
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,000
Speaker 21:  that has the same battery life as an iPad as you know, the same quiet silent

848
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,400
Speaker 21:  performance as an iPad it's nearly as light or if you add a keyboard to

849
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,760
Speaker 21:  an iPad, the iPad is heavier than an air. So it's like

850
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,920
Speaker 21:  all of those reasons to go with an iPad have evaporated. And so now

851
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,400
Speaker 21:  it's like well where does this iPad sit? And I think for a lot of people

852
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,240
Speaker 21:  it really is not their only device, it is a secondary or tertiary

853
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,920
Speaker 21:  when you count the phone, the comp, the laptop and the tablet and then it's

854
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Speaker 21:  like okay well how valuable is this thing to you? And then it's like well

855
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,680
Speaker 21:  if it's a tertiary device, buy the $300 one and watch your Netflix

856
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,880
Speaker 21:  on the couch and like you know, don't try to even think that you're gonna

857
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,800
Speaker 21:  replace your laptop with

858
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,280
Speaker 2:  It. It is really interesting that there's been this big picture iPad

859
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,120
Speaker 2:  transition, like it's almost coming full circle back to what it

860
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,640
Speaker 2:  initially was, which was like the thing that sits between your computer

861
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,560
Speaker 2:  and your phone that is like, it's good for consumption, it's nice for sitting

862
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,520
Speaker 2:  on the couch, it's more immersive than your phone and less chaotic than

863
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,480
Speaker 2:  your laptop and like it has a place that it exists but I think, but I think

864
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,520
Speaker 2:  you're right, we spent a decade being like, well my laptop kind of sucks.

865
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:21,640
Speaker 2:  What if we could get this thing that is like smooth and fast and

866
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,600
Speaker 2:  last all day to get up to the laptop level of things And

867
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,320
Speaker 2:  with things like stage manager as we've talked about, I'm not super confident

868
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,240
Speaker 2:  that's possible. I'm also not sure that's what we want anymore.

869
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,440
Speaker 2:  It's like and this we can, we can have the like should there be a touchscreen

870
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,200
Speaker 2:  Mac debate all day? And I would very much like to because yes there should

871
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,720
Speaker 2:  be but I do think you're right that like the the distance between those two

872
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,960
Speaker 2:  things, especially again for what we're talking about for like most people's

873
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,640
Speaker 2:  everyday computing, it is just not that different. Like if you're the type

874
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,360
Speaker 2:  who is like oh I want to do the manipulate, the 3D models

875
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,240
Speaker 2:  like the stuff that Apple likes to show on stage to show the new chips, knock

876
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,280
Speaker 2:  yourself out by an iPad, you'll be very happy.

877
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,960
Speaker 21:  Use that pencil and and draw those drawings And which

878
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,520
Speaker 2:  Brings us to the pros because these are the pros I feel like

879
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,680
Speaker 2:  are actually the easiest one for me to understand because it feels very self

880
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,600
Speaker 2:  selecting to me. It's like this is for people who either just want the best

881
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,400
Speaker 2:  thing because it is the best thing or have some specific use case they know

882
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,880
Speaker 2:  they're gonna like beat the hell outta their iPad with and want it for that

883
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,640
Speaker 2:  specific purpose. Is that that fair? Is that the right read?

884
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:28,160
Speaker 21:  Yeah, I think like especially when we talk about the 12.9 Pro, I think the

885
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,680
Speaker 21:  12.9 Pro is like for the person who wants the absolute best

886
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:35,960
Speaker 21:  is like actually going to commit to replacing their laptop with it. It's

887
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,840
Speaker 21:  got a big enough screen where it's like it's not as cramped as the 11 inch

888
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,560
Speaker 21:  models and you can do multitasking and things like that And there's a lot

889
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,400
Speaker 21:  of people out there who are willing to go through a lot of hoops to work

890
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,200
Speaker 21:  around iPad OS limitations to make it their daily driver machine.

891
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,120
Speaker 21:  They'll plug it into a display, they'll plug in hubs and dongles

892
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,040
Speaker 21:  and everything to it and and use it like it's a real computer and

893
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,800
Speaker 21:  and that makes sense. I think that the 11 inch pro is kind of like a forgotten

894
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,680
Speaker 21:  step child now and it's like we see the 12.9 inch pro push

895
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,520
Speaker 21:  forward each year. Last year it got the mini l e d screen

896
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,080
Speaker 21:  which is like a tremendous display. It matches the display that's on the

897
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,920
Speaker 21:  MacBook Pros at a significant high higher price. So you're getting

898
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,520
Speaker 21:  a better screen with that and that's absolutely important but like the 11

899
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,280
Speaker 21:  inch didn't get that, it didn't get it again this year. So like what's going

900
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,200
Speaker 21:  on with the 11 inch? Like is it was one gonna stick around? Like why not

901
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,000
Speaker 21:  just have base model air and then 12.9 inch Pro

902
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,360
Speaker 21:  like that's like seems like to be the mix of that makes sense. And I say

903
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,840
Speaker 21:  this as a person that owns the 11 inch iPad Pro, like I'm the weirdo that

904
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,040
Speaker 21:  bought it but like if I were shopping for a new one right now and I was

905
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,560
Speaker 21:  not looking at secondhand or special deals or anything like that, it would

906
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,440
Speaker 21:  be a really tough sell to get the 11 inch over either the air which offers

907
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,920
Speaker 21:  basically the same experience at a lower price or the 12.9 which offers

908
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,080
Speaker 21:  a meaningfully different experience even though at a higher

909
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,640
Speaker 22:  Price. Yeah, my thing with few of the pro is basically like if you wanna

910
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,440
Speaker 22:  buy it, you know who you are and more power to you. There are some like

911
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,840
Speaker 22:  features on the pro that are very clearly the pro features like the ultra

912
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,760
Speaker 22:  wide, the promo, the M two. If you need like one or more of

913
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,600
Speaker 22:  those then you're someone who should buy the pro. I'm with you David that

914
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,560
Speaker 22:  that one to me is very easy to sort of understand who would be

915
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,240
Speaker 22:  buying that versus who would be buying the other ones.

916
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,720
Speaker 2:  Yeah that one I feel like one easy question I find for people is like how

917
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,840
Speaker 2:  aggressively are you? Are you gonna use the pencil? And if people are like

918
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,240
Speaker 2:  the pencil is very important to me, it's like that get the pro right, it's

919
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,960
Speaker 2:  like you, you want the higher refresh rate, you want the bigger screen.

920
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:35,000
Speaker 2:  I will say I was on a plane last night and this woman sat down next to me,

921
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,560
Speaker 2:  took out a 12.9 inch pro, had like a clip thing

922
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,320
Speaker 2:  that went on the seat back in front of her and literally it was like she

923
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,800
Speaker 2:  had hung up like a projector screen on the screen in,

924
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,920
Speaker 21:  She had a whole TV with

925
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,600
Speaker 2:  Her. It was the coolest flex I've ever seen and it was over the like crappy

926
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,360
Speaker 2:  little seat back display. She was like no, no and hung up her 12.9 inch iPad.

927
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,200
Speaker 2:  It was the most amazing thing I've ever experienced. I've never wanted one

928
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,920
Speaker 2:  of those things more than I did in that moment. But yeah, I think that's

929
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,720
Speaker 2:  right and Dan, this is kind of where I'm at now too is like in a certain

930
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,440
Speaker 2:  way, like we have these new models and I'm not actually sure the iPad

931
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,120
Speaker 2:  lineup just changed very much. It's like we have,

932
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,760
Speaker 2:  the ones I'm inclined to tell people to buy are the 329 inch

933
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:17,200
Speaker 2:  iPad that already existed, the iPad Air that already existed

934
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,360
Speaker 2:  and the pro which I guess got upgraded but not in like an earth shattering

935
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,320
Speaker 2:  way. So buy the pro whenever you feel like buying the pro and you'll probably

936
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,520
Speaker 2:  be very happy or

937
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,200
Speaker 21:  Buy last year's model of the pro. It's like basically my recommendation

938
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:29,720
Speaker 21:  to everybody.

939
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,760
Speaker 2:  That's what I was just about to ask like is is this where we're gonna be

940
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,040
Speaker 2:  with iPads for the foreseeable future? It's like there's so much performance

941
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,280
Speaker 2:  headroom, these things don't change all that much year to year because they

942
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,800
Speaker 2:  can't really, it's just a screen that you hold.

943
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:45,720
Speaker 21:  Yeah, I mean I think what we're seeing actually is because of this

944
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,360
Speaker 21:  performance headroom because of what I was saying earlier that like during

945
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,680
Speaker 21:  like normal tasks, you really can't perceive a difference between this,

946
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,920
Speaker 21:  these different levels of iPads we're seeing Apple add artificial

947
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:58,880
Speaker 21:  separators to them and so the first one was oh stage

948
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,720
Speaker 21:  manager's only gonna be for the M one iPads or newer. So that was

949
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,600
Speaker 21:  limited to the air and the pro, they ended up backtracking on that and adding

950
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,200
Speaker 21:  it to older pro models that had older chip sets but limiting it and saying

951
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,640
Speaker 21:  that it won't do external support and maybe that's accurate, maybe that

952
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,800
Speaker 21:  is like, you know it, the hardware there just can't handle it for whatever

953
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,760
Speaker 21:  reason. A, you know, 2020 MacBook Air with eight gigs of RAM and an

954
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,880
Speaker 21:  M one processor can let you do all the windows you want, but we're gonna

955
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,440
Speaker 21:  limit it on this one and now we're seeing it with the M two. They are

956
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,280
Speaker 21:  limiting this new pencil feature which allows you to hover over the screen

957
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,880
Speaker 21:  and get a little bit more precise actions with the pencil that's limited

958
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,120
Speaker 21:  to the M two For some reason it's not clear to me why that's limited to

959
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,280
Speaker 21:  the M two. They're not back boarding it to the M one pros. So if you bought

960
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,680
Speaker 21:  one last year, you don't get that feature. If you buy an air, you don't

961
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,480
Speaker 21:  get that feature. They are limiting it to the M two and it, it's just starting

962
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,040
Speaker 21:  to feel more and more like they are trying to find different things to

963
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,880
Speaker 21:  segregate these and, and segment them but that aren't really based on hardware

964
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,840
Speaker 21:  limitations. It's just more like we wanted to add this feature to the pro

965
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,040
Speaker 21:  model because it makes it more compelling as a pro device.

966
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,280
Speaker 2:  You know what this reminds me of is every other Apple device right now,

967
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:07,840
Speaker 2:  I mean we, we talked about this a few months ago with the MacBook error with

968
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,960
Speaker 2:  M two, which is like, it has a couple of upgrades but then it's also like

969
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,720
Speaker 2:  you can pretty easily land in a place where it's like, well the the M one

970
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,760
Speaker 2:  MacBook error is still a terrific computer that's still gonna last you a

971
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,360
Speaker 2:  long time with the iPhones. It's like, okay the, the iPhone 14 has some stuff

972
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,520
Speaker 2:  going for it, but it's not functionally all that different in your day-to-day

973
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,160
Speaker 2:  life than the iPhone 13. Like we're at this funny moment with a lot of Apple

974
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,120
Speaker 2:  products where it's like, especially with the M series, they got so good

975
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:35,440
Speaker 2:  so fast that it's like, I mean the jump from I, I still, I'm on a

976
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,240
Speaker 2:  I I just switched maybe six months ago from an Intel-based

977
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:43,080
Speaker 2:  MAC Mini to an M one Mac mini and like once a day I just

978
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,120
Speaker 2:  reach over and just touch it and the fan is not on and it's not hot and it

979
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,560
Speaker 2:  just makes me happy. Like still

980
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:51,240
Speaker 21:  With all of those examples that you gave, there are hardware differences,

981
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,760
Speaker 21:  right? So like the M one air and the M two air

982
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,560
Speaker 21:  run, all the same apps, all the same things, they've all the same core

983
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,200
Speaker 21:  features. The M two s difference is it has a bigger screen and a better

984
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,920
Speaker 21:  front facing camera and so like those are hardware differences where

985
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,880
Speaker 21:  we're seeing segregation in the iPad line is like, okay so it's got an M

986
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,840
Speaker 21:  two chip but like the feature difference doesn't feel like a hardware difference.

987
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,040
Speaker 21:  It feels much more like a software feature difference. And that's where

988
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,320
Speaker 21:  the weirdness is really kind of coming in to the iPad because like you said,

989
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,920
Speaker 21:  how much can they go on the hardware that they haven't gone already? It

990
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,560
Speaker 21:  is a slab alas that you hold in your hand. I really would like them to move

991
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,120
Speaker 21:  the camera on all of the models. Yes, weirdly the 10th gen iPad is the first

992
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,880
Speaker 21:  one to have the camera in the right spot. Okay. I assume they're gonna move

993
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,120
Speaker 21:  it on the rest of them eventually, but like beyond that like I don't know

994
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,000
Speaker 21:  what what further can they do with the hardware? So now it becomes a different

995
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,880
Speaker 21:  type of segmentation through the feature set and the software, which is

996
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,240
Speaker 21:  not the experience that you have on the Mac. The Mac you can run, if you

997
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,720
Speaker 21:  have an M one chip or an M two chip, you can run all the same apps. They

998
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,160
Speaker 21:  might run a little faster on the M two but it's all the same ones.

999
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,000
Speaker 2:  You're right. And I think it's gonna be interesting to see if this line gets

1000
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,920
Speaker 2:  any smaller over time because part of me feels like Apple is now like deeply

1001
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,880
Speaker 2:  invested in 50 different iPad product lines and this is all just gonna

1002
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,800
Speaker 2:  keep getting weirder. Or as some people have theorized, like maybe this

1003
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,200
Speaker 2:  is a sort of awkward in between moment for a lot of reasons, like the

1004
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,280
Speaker 2:  chip shortage is real and the world is weird and we're in the middle of a

1005
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,000
Speaker 2:  lot of like economic changes and all that stuff and that maybe whatever,

1006
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,960
Speaker 2:  it'll be like the 2023 iPad, they'll, they'll just like blow it all up

1007
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,960
Speaker 2:  and be like, look we have an iPad, it's called iPad.

1008
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,400
Speaker 21:  Well yeah, I, I have a feeling like the 10th gen or whatever that

1009
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,200
Speaker 21:  successor is will eventually get down to like the $350 price.

1010
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,040
Speaker 21:  It will knock the, the old model out of contention and like it'll

1011
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:40,000
Speaker 21:  disappear and then we'll have a much more like obvious type of

1012
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,680
Speaker 21:  good better, best lineup in the iPads. You know, not counting the mini,

1013
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,640
Speaker 21:  which is kinda a weird outlier, but like right now it is kind of a weird

1014
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,480
Speaker 21:  transition. We have a weird transition where the 10th gen iPad has

1015
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,200
Speaker 21:  some features that the pro iPad doesn't have that are better, like the better

1016
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,840
Speaker 21:  camera placement, the the keyboard case is more flexible, gives you more

1017
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,680
Speaker 21:  options, things like that has a function row, which the $350 keyboard

1018
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,640
Speaker 21:  for the 12.9 inch iPad does not. So we're, we're in this weird

1019
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,920
Speaker 21:  transition. It's interesting that Apple decided to roll it out when it did

1020
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,880
Speaker 21:  instead of just waiting, but you know, that's what they do over time

1021
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,440
Speaker 21:  I think it will smooth out. I can't imagine that they're gonna keep adding

1022
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,280
Speaker 21:  more models to this lineup because I don't though I will say there's

1023
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,160
Speaker 21:  long been rumored a 15 inch iPad some point down the road. So maybe that'll

1024
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,520
Speaker 21:  show up at the top end and, and and we'll be like, oh man,

1025
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,360
Speaker 2:  The iPad Promax will get a full hour of this podcast I

1026
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,760
Speaker 22:  Promise. But yeah, that's sort of been my read on it too. It's like if the

1027
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,320
Speaker 22:  iPad 10 appeals to you and like there, like we've been saying there are

1028
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:40,240
Speaker 22:  reasons it might appeal to you, just like give it a little bit, it will

1029
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,000
Speaker 22:  get down to around 3 29 ish and like, especially if you're buying

1030
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,840
Speaker 22:  something for kids, I really don't think anyone should be spending more

1031
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,280
Speaker 22:  than that.

1032
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,040
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. So Monica, for you what is now the like default

1033
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,000
Speaker 2:  iPad to compare stuff to? Somebody asks you the, I I want a laptop but

1034
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,600
Speaker 2:  I don't wanna spend a thousand dollars on a MacBook and you're like, well

1035
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,960
Speaker 2:  have you thought about an iPad? Which iPad is the one they have to think

1036
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,160
Speaker 2:  about?

1037
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,120
Speaker 22:  Oh well right now I, for me it's still the 3 29. Okay. I mean I as they're

1038
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,480
Speaker 22:  still selling that so that's still the one that's gonna give me problems.

1039
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,000
Speaker 22:  I mean I might now have to, you know, mention the 4 4 89 but the

1040
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,440
Speaker 22:  3 29 1, as long as they're still selling it is still I think a problem for

1041
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,840
Speaker 22:  people who are making budget laptops that are really bad.

1042
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:22,360
Speaker 2:  That's fair. Yeah, you just need like a keyboard shortcut that just inserts

1043
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:26,080
Speaker 2:  like four paragraphs explaining the iPad line into every review that you

1044
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,880
Speaker 2:  do of a, of a Windows laptop. Alright, we should go. But thank you both.

1045
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,000
Speaker 2:  This is, this is very helpful and I'm gonna go back to my iPad mini, which

1046
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,360
Speaker 2:  I feel very good about buying and we'll never give up for any other iPad

1047
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:36,680
Speaker 2:  no matter

1048
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,920
Speaker 22:  What. That's an easy one. If you want a small one by that one.

1049
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's the best and it is. You trust me. Even if you don't know you want

1050
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:46,600
Speaker 2:  a small iPad, you want a small iPad. All right, thank you both.

1051
