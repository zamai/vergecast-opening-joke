00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:06,365
Speaker 2:  Welcome To, The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Sneaky Gaming Strategies.

3
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:10,045
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I am sitting in my basement doing Legos,

4
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:13,165
Speaker 2:  which is a sentence I have not been able to say for a long time and I'm very

5
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:17,085
Speaker 2:  excited to say so. Liam James, our producer got me this Polaroid

6
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:21,085
Speaker 2:  one step Lego thing for Christmas this past year, which is

7
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:24,605
Speaker 2:  part of, I'm sure you've seen this, but Lego doing all the stuff with old

8
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:28,485
Speaker 2:  technology and everything from the set of the office to

9
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:32,405
Speaker 2:  the McLaren Formula one car, taking all of that stuff, putting it into Lego

10
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:35,725
Speaker 2:  form and making it available for adults. It's all, I think like

11
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:39,525
Speaker 2:  ridiculously expensive to the point where I have not been able to talk myself

12
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:42,605
Speaker 2:  into actually buying one of these things for myself. But I've realized it

13
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:46,565
Speaker 2:  makes an awesome gift and I hope more people give me these cool Lego sets

14
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:50,125
Speaker 2:  as a gift. So I'm gonna spend some time putting this thing together. I realized

15
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,885
Speaker 2:  today I've been kind of intimidated by it. It's, let's see, it's

16
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:56,845
Speaker 2:  516 pieces and it is 18 and up

17
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,245
Speaker 2:  and you would think I would be able to handle that, but I feel like I'm rusty

18
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:02,445
Speaker 2:  with Legos. It's been a while and the idea of actually sitting here and putting

19
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:06,045
Speaker 2:  this thing together is both very fun and kind of intimidating. But I have

20
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:09,205
Speaker 2:  an afternoon. I have shows to catch up on. It's gonna be awesome. I'm very

21
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:12,685
Speaker 2:  excited and pretty soon you are going to see this thing in a background when

22
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:16,245
Speaker 2:  we record The Verge cast, I promise. Anyway, we have an awesome show coming

23
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:19,405
Speaker 2:  up for you today. We're gonna do two things. First, we're gonna talk to Will

24
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:23,285
Speaker 2:  Poor, who has been kind of immersing himself in the world of Right

25
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:25,965
Speaker 2:  to Repair. It's a really interesting time in the world of Right to Repair.

26
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:29,085
Speaker 2:  There have been big bills that have gone through. There's some real momentum

27
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:32,045
Speaker 2:  for the idea that you should be able to Repair your own gadgets, but there's

28
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:35,885
Speaker 2:  still a lot of work to do and it's not clear that all of the

29
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:39,085
Speaker 2:  pieces are actually gonna start to come together quickly in a way that makes

30
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:42,445
Speaker 2:  this stuff really work the way that it seems like it ought to. So Will has

31
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:45,365
Speaker 2:  been talking to tons of people. He's gonna come and give us kind of his first

32
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:48,645
Speaker 2:  report on what he's learned so far. Then we're gonna talk to Tom Warren about

33
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:51,765
Speaker 2:  Microsoft's news from last week. So we talked about this a little on Friday's

34
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:55,885
Speaker 2:  show, but Microsoft made what seems like a relatively small set

35
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:59,765
Speaker 2:  of gaming announcements last week that kind of hide this huge

36
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:03,405
Speaker 2:  vision for The future of gaming and the way that things are going to change

37
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:06,805
Speaker 2:  in the gaming industry in a really big way over the next two years. Microsoft

38
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:10,685
Speaker 2:  might be wrong, it might be early, it might be late, but it is not

39
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:14,365
Speaker 2:  betting as small as it would have. You think Tom knows everything about what's

40
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:18,205
Speaker 2:  going on here and he's gonna help us figure out what the real story

41
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,845
Speaker 2:  of Microsoft and Xbox and gaming really is. All that is coming up in just

42
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:25,285
Speaker 2:  a sec, but now I get to go do the thing that is my favorite with Allego Set

43
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:27,485
Speaker 2:  where you open it up and just dump it on the ground and kind of see what

44
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:30,925
Speaker 2:  happens. This is where I inevitably like lose six pieces that turn out to

45
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:34,085
Speaker 2:  be very frustrating for hours, but it's like the beginning of a puzzle, right?

46
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:37,725
Speaker 2:  You pour it out, you kind of take stock and you see what you have. This is

47
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:41,565
Speaker 2:  either gonna take me an hour or six months and you'll never hear me

48
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:44,525
Speaker 2:  again. So wish me luck. This is The Vergecast. Let's go

49
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:36,965
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So last year was a big year for The right to

50
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:40,645
Speaker 2:  repair movement. There were three major laws. We had one in New York, Minnesota,

51
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:44,485
Speaker 2:  and California, all of which passed, and all of which said a very basic

52
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:48,445
Speaker 2:  thing to electronics makers that you have to let other people repair

53
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:52,285
Speaker 2:  the products you make. That means giving independent repair shops or even

54
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:55,805
Speaker 2:  individual people access to the same parts and tools and

55
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:59,445
Speaker 2:  information that you, the manufacturer give your own Repair shops

56
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:03,365
Speaker 2:  or to use just one example that I'm confident we're going to refer to

57
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:07,405
Speaker 2:  1 million times throughout this story. If your iPhone breaks the Apple store

58
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:11,325
Speaker 2:  shouldn't be the only place equipped and allowed to iFixit. Last

59
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:14,925
Speaker 2:  year, in the midst of all this, we had Kyle, Wes, the CEO of iFixit on the

60
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:18,685
Speaker 2:  show to talk about just how big a deal the California law

61
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:19,565
Speaker 2:  was in particular

62
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:23,725
Speaker 5:  With the California law we're up to 20% of the US population

63
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,005
Speaker 5:  has passed The right to Repair lot

64
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:29,125
Speaker 2:  At the time Apple had just signed on to support that law and soon after

65
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,965
Speaker 2:  pledged to abide by it nationally. So on paper this was a big

66
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,445
Speaker 2:  victory lap moment for all of The, right, to Repair people. But now it's

67
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:39,965
Speaker 2:  2024, which is the year that these laws are actually supposed to go into

68
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,805
Speaker 2:  effect. And we wanted to know what that means. What's actually changing out

69
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:47,605
Speaker 2:  there in the world of electronics repairs. Like if your iPhone breaks this

70
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:51,245
Speaker 2:  year, are you better off than if your iPhone broke last year?

71
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:54,965
Speaker 2:  Our producer Will Poor has been looking into that question for a while and

72
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:58,325
Speaker 2:  he claims he has answers of which I'm always suspicious Will poor Welcome,

73
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:58,925
Speaker 2:  To, The Vergecast.

74
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:00,325
Speaker 6:  Hello. Thank you.

75
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:01,605
Speaker 2:  Do you have answers?

76
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:05,885
Speaker 6:  I do. I have a lot of answers. I talk to a lot of people to try to understand

77
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:09,845
Speaker 6:  what's going on here. I talk to Repair shop owners, activists, lawmakers,

78
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:13,925
Speaker 6:  and big companies like Apple and Google and you know, shocker,

79
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,685
Speaker 6:  the answer really depends on who you talk to. The advocates for these

80
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:21,245
Speaker 6:  laws, the folks who have spent years trying to establish the idea of

81
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,885
Speaker 6:  repair as a right, they're pretty jazzed.

82
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:27,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it was an absolutely monster year for Right to Repair.

83
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:30,765
Speaker 6:  That's Nathan Proctor. He runs The right to Repair campaign for the Public

84
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:34,565
Speaker 6:  Interest Research Group. He said last year started with a disappointment

85
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,685
Speaker 6:  that big New York bill got watered down by the governor at the 11th hour.

86
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:43,205
Speaker 7:  I think we just went all out last year. We really put everything we had into

87
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:47,005
Speaker 7:  it and then Minnesota passed the broadest right to

88
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:50,165
Speaker 7:  Repair Bill. We've seen yet even broader than when New York did with fewer

89
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:54,285
Speaker 7:  loopholes. Then Colorado passed an excellent farmer

90
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:57,685
Speaker 7:  right to Repair Bill, which was the first of the nation on that. That was

91
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,485
Speaker 7:  an extremely difficult fight. Hang

92
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,045
Speaker 2:  On. Did, did he just say farmers? Are we talking about farmers?

93
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:06,125
Speaker 6:  We are. We absolutely are. Right to Repair is this huge deal in

94
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,605
Speaker 6:  agriculture also. It's not just consumer electronics, huh? That's because

95
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:13,605
Speaker 6:  John Deere and a whole bunch of other companies have gotten super,

96
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:16,485
Speaker 6:  super controlling about who can repair their tractors.

97
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:20,205
Speaker 2:  John Deere is like the apple of the tractors, right? I'm remembering this

98
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:23,565
Speaker 2:  now that they're like super mad about anybody who wants to Repair their tractor.

99
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:27,565
Speaker 6:  They're the leader in this space. They're a huge problem for farmers and

100
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:30,885
Speaker 6:  it's a huge deal for agriculture because farmers'

101
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:34,205
Speaker 6:  livelihoods depend on the stuff. you know, it's not like, like most of our

102
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:38,045
Speaker 6:  phones where it's, this is an annoyance but it's not make or break. So this

103
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:41,525
Speaker 6:  kind of thing comes up in sort of higher stake situations like

104
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:45,485
Speaker 6:  agriculture. Wheelchairs is another place where this debate

105
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:49,205
Speaker 6:  is happening. Other kinds of medical equipment. So it's a lot broader than

106
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:52,165
Speaker 6:  just consumer electronics. Anyway, here's the rest of the Nathan quote.

107
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:56,405
Speaker 7:  And then California just absolutely overwhelmingly passed

108
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:59,565
Speaker 7:  and you know, and people know or might know that Apple

109
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:03,925
Speaker 7:  endorsed that bill, which I think is just a sign of is how much momentum

110
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:04,685
Speaker 7:  we had

111
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:09,205
Speaker 6:  That Apple endorsement was notable because for years it was

112
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:13,005
Speaker 6:  the go-to example of a big powerful company Lobbying

113
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:16,565
Speaker 6:  super hard against repair laws. So the endorsement was

114
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:20,885
Speaker 6:  evidence of industry warming up to independent Repair, which is just

115
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,805
Speaker 6:  not how things felt for a long time

116
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:27,445
Speaker 7:  In all the years that we've been on Right? to Repair, you know, we've heard

117
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:31,445
Speaker 7:  just absolute throw spaghetti at the wall kind of

118
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:35,405
Speaker 7:  arguments against it. The big categories are safety,

119
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:39,285
Speaker 7:  security, privacy liability, intellectual property.

120
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:43,245
Speaker 7:  I remember vividly when ah, Abraham's lobbyist,

121
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:46,485
Speaker 6:  That's the Association of Home Appliance manufacturers,

122
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:50,085
Speaker 7:  Claimed that if people were able to fix their own

123
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:54,205
Speaker 7:  dryers, like you know, closed dryers that you know, they have a latch and

124
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:57,725
Speaker 7:  the door and what if the door latch came undone because you didn't do the

125
00:08:57,725 --> 00:09:01,165
Speaker 7:  repair right? And then your child put their arm in there and got it ripped

126
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:04,245
Speaker 7:  off by your dryer. So right to Repair means

127
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:05,725
Speaker 7:  dismembering children.

128
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:10,165
Speaker 2:  So this is wild. This went a whole way. I did not expect, but this

129
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:13,525
Speaker 2:  makes me think of the thing you always heard from Apple and others about

130
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:16,285
Speaker 2:  like If, you try to take your phone apart, you're gonna blow up the battery

131
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:18,965
Speaker 2:  and burn your house down. Right? That's kind of the consumer electronics

132
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:22,965
Speaker 2:  version of this and I think maybe equally realistic as someone who has

133
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,685
Speaker 2:  blown up a battery trying to take my phone apart in the past

134
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:29,485
Speaker 6:  It happens. But yeah, I mean this is how far back this, the safety

135
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:33,845
Speaker 6:  argument against right to Repair goes and this is a drum that, that all

136
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:36,325
Speaker 6:  kinds of manufacturers have been beating for a really long time,

137
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:40,645
Speaker 2:  But they're starting to, if not give up on the safety argument,

138
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:43,285
Speaker 2:  at least roll it back a little. It sounds like

139
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:47,605
Speaker 6:  Yes, manufacturers are giving up on some arguments

140
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:51,725
Speaker 6:  that just have not panned out for them in the past. you know, the times

141
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:55,525
Speaker 6:  are changing. Apple in particular has started to publish repair

142
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:59,325
Speaker 6:  manuals on its website. It has this self-service Repair program,

143
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:03,565
Speaker 6:  which The Verge and lots of other people have pointed out feels a lot like

144
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:07,085
Speaker 6:  malicious compliance because it's super expensive and complicated. But in

145
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:10,725
Speaker 6:  general, apple is playing ball with these new laws.

146
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:14,925
Speaker 7:  Apple announced more DIY options in December. you know, these

147
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:18,205
Speaker 7:  companies are getting ready for it. you know, So, I think that like it's

148
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:21,205
Speaker 7:  clear that to some degree that there will be compliance. Like they, they're

149
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:24,365
Speaker 7:  planning for it. They think that's great. I'm glad that they're not all gonna

150
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:25,565
Speaker 7:  fight. Okay,

151
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:29,245
Speaker 2:  So this all lines up with roughly where we were

152
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:33,245
Speaker 2:  with Kyle a few months ago. We have some laws, not everything

153
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,925
Speaker 2:  is perfect, but the people who have been fighting this for a long time and

154
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:40,005
Speaker 2:  like you said, they've been fighting for this for a long time, are pretty

155
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:43,285
Speaker 2:  happy. But I don't know, you're setting this all up in such a way that it

156
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:46,685
Speaker 2:  makes me think there there are those who should be psyched, who are not psyched.

157
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:50,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. So here's the other shoe dropping. I really wanted to talk

158
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:54,485
Speaker 6:  to Repair shop owners about this 'cause they're the people

159
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:58,405
Speaker 6:  that the advocates for these laws say that they're written for and I did.

160
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:02,365
Speaker 6:  And truthfully, they're not expecting a lot of material improvement

161
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:06,325
Speaker 6:  here. Hmm. One owner I talked with was Jessa Jones who runs a

162
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:09,805
Speaker 6:  repair and data recovery shop in Western New York and she

163
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:13,725
Speaker 6:  echoed pretty much every other shop owner I talked to. Basically

164
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:17,845
Speaker 6:  she thinks the laws are well intentioned but they don't address some really

165
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,885
Speaker 6:  critical things. For example, there is this very basic practice that

166
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:24,285
Speaker 6:  any repair shop should have at their disposal.

167
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:29,005
Speaker 8:  I would like to be able to have a filing cabinet where I put

168
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:33,365
Speaker 8:  any phone that is here for parts or pieces or donated or

169
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:37,325
Speaker 8:  old or something I buy. I wanna be able to put it in a file cabinet where

170
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,405
Speaker 8:  at any point in time here comes a matching phone model that I can

171
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:45,565
Speaker 8:  go to my file cabinet junkyard of parts and I can

172
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:48,765
Speaker 8:  take out a perfectly fine working, let's say

173
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:52,645
Speaker 8:  true depth camera out of this phone and install it in that phone.

174
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:55,445
Speaker 8:  And I can take two bad and make one good,

175
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:59,765
Speaker 6:  But she can't do that with iPhones. Take the true depth camera,

176
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,645
Speaker 6:  that's the iPhone's front facing camera system. She can order a new one

177
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:06,925
Speaker 6:  direct from Apple. It's about 185 bucks for an iPhone 15.

178
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:11,045
Speaker 6:  Making that part available technically puts Apple in compliance with

179
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:14,685
Speaker 6:  the current repair laws. But if she opened up her file cabinet

180
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:18,405
Speaker 6:  junkyard and swapped in a working camera from a dead iPhone

181
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:22,645
Speaker 6:  face, ID might just stop working. That's because the motherboards of

182
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:26,005
Speaker 6:  modern iPhones keep track of some other parts within the phone

183
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:30,165
Speaker 6:  and If you swap in an aftermarket part or even a genuine

184
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:34,005
Speaker 6:  apple part that apple didn't sell you, your phone might start acting

185
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:34,285
Speaker 6:  up.

186
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:38,685
Speaker 8:  If I replace your battery with a quality aftermarket battery,

187
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:43,245
Speaker 8:  you can no longer go into your settings and see your battery

188
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:47,165
Speaker 8:  health. You lost a function. That's terrible. That's wrong.

189
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,045
Speaker 8:  And that's what's happening now.

190
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:52,405
Speaker 2:  So let me just real quick make sure I understand what's going on here. Yeah,

191
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,165
Speaker 2:  it seems like what you're saying is if I have a

192
00:12:56,315 --> 00:13:00,045
Speaker 2:  perfectly good iPhone where most of the parts are still working and then

193
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:03,325
Speaker 2:  I have another perfectly good iPhone where most of the parts are still working

194
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,525
Speaker 2:  and I take one perfectly good part out of one iPhone and put it in the other,

195
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:09,685
Speaker 2:  there's a pretty good chance it just won't work.

196
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:13,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah, and this is what's so like mysterious and galling about Apple products,

197
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,965
Speaker 6:  specifically Apple products full of genuine apple components do

198
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,765
Speaker 6:  not play nicely with one another. People have done this famous screen swap

199
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:25,525
Speaker 6:  test where they'll take two modern iPhones, swap the screens, so

200
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:29,285
Speaker 6:  two working phones, two working screens, and all of a sudden those screens

201
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:33,205
Speaker 6:  won't work properly anymore. Weird. It's super weird and it's because

202
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:36,965
Speaker 6:  of this process of software locking components to the motherboard.

203
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:40,765
Speaker 6:  It's called parts pairing and it makes repairing iPhones a minefield.

204
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:45,045
Speaker 6:  I Fixit has been keeping really careful track of which parts cause

205
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:48,605
Speaker 6:  which problems when replaced. Some parts lose functionality,

206
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:52,405
Speaker 6:  others trigger these warning messages that you can't dismiss and there's

207
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:56,125
Speaker 6:  no telling how the next iPhone is gonna behave or even which parts

208
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,045
Speaker 6:  could break retroactively down the road.

209
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,965
Speaker 8:  You get into this really difficult and seemingly

210
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:06,445
Speaker 8:  pointless sea of problems where you don't know

211
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:11,125
Speaker 8:  what is just serialized serial numbers paired to your

212
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,765
Speaker 8:  logic board and you have to harvest it from your device versus

213
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:18,405
Speaker 8:  which ones of the guts can you use that came in the phone you bought on eBay.

214
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:19,725
Speaker 8:  So it's very challenging.

215
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,365
Speaker 2:  The skeptical part of my brain here says that this is purely

216
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:28,325
Speaker 2:  malicious on Apple's part, that Apple has a big repair business, that it

217
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,445
Speaker 2:  has lots of reasons to uphold and this is one basically

218
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:35,325
Speaker 2:  impenetrable way to win that fight. But just

219
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:38,925
Speaker 2:  for the sake of satiating, the other part of my brain that doesn't believe

220
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:42,885
Speaker 2:  everything is a conspiracy theory designed to ruin customers. What is

221
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:46,805
Speaker 2:  the good reason for parts pairing? Is there a theoretically good reason for

222
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:47,405
Speaker 2:  parts pairing?

223
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:51,365
Speaker 6:  Sure. I mean, apple and other manufacturers will tell you that there are

224
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:55,365
Speaker 6:  lots of reasons why at minimum it's helpful to assign like a digital

225
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:59,325
Speaker 6:  serial number to each specific part. That's a super basic thing that

226
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:03,045
Speaker 6:  helps them keep track of inventory and all kinds of stuff. Okay. And even

227
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:07,005
Speaker 6:  more than that, there are these kind of wonky calibration related reasons

228
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:10,685
Speaker 6:  that make it helpful for your phone to know which specific

229
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:14,565
Speaker 6:  part it's talking to. Like which one came off the manufacturing line.

230
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:18,325
Speaker 6:  So there's a lot of sort of nitty gritty stuff that is completely invisible

231
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:22,165
Speaker 6:  to the end user and completely benign. But it's also just way too easy for

232
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:25,685
Speaker 6:  a manufacturer to do really frustrating, really visible things with this

233
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:29,645
Speaker 6:  technology too. And in the case of iPhones, it really does seem

234
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:33,965
Speaker 6:  designed to kind of nudge you towards apple's parts, towards

235
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:37,805
Speaker 6:  apple's repair shops towards that very polished Apple experience.

236
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:42,285
Speaker 8:  I think that Apple is best thought of as the kind of mom that

237
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:46,085
Speaker 8:  cuts your stake when you're 30. you know, it's just like, let me, let me

238
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:49,245
Speaker 8:  help you with that. Let me help you with that. In their heart of hearts,

239
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:53,565
Speaker 8:  they truly just don't want for you to have

240
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:57,365
Speaker 8:  to live the sad life of someone who has an iPhone with a cracked

241
00:15:57,365 --> 00:16:00,725
Speaker 8:  screen or a cracked rear camera glass. Or

242
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:04,645
Speaker 8:  maybe the, the waterproofing isn't as tight as it used to be because

243
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:08,925
Speaker 8:  you replaced the battery with some shop. you know, they don't want for

244
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,565
Speaker 8:  you to have the hint of any kind of negative

245
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:14,805
Speaker 8:  experience. They wanna cut that stake for you.

246
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:19,165
Speaker 2:  It's an amazing analogy because A, I kind of do want that

247
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:23,165
Speaker 2:  in my life, right? It's, and you, it's see how's right there are, there

248
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:27,125
Speaker 2:  are upsides to having someone cut my steak. For me it does make me feel

249
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:31,005
Speaker 2:  better, but also it can be both well intentioned and

250
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:34,005
Speaker 2:  problematic all at the same time, right? Like I think there's a cognitive

251
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:37,125
Speaker 2:  dissonance of all of this that is, has always been hard for me to wrap my

252
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,445
Speaker 2:  head around, but that's a pretty good analogy for it. Totally.

253
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,045
Speaker 6:  And even If, you remove apple's like secret

254
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:47,045
Speaker 6:  private heart intention out of it. It is just a practice

255
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:51,045
Speaker 6:  that ensures a really clean experience and then occasionally

256
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:53,125
Speaker 6:  is super, super frustrating.

257
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:57,365
Speaker 2:  And this is increasingly common. We've talked a bunch about Apple at this

258
00:16:57,365 --> 00:17:00,965
Speaker 2:  point. I think Apple is the most obvious just because it's sort of clear

259
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:04,365
Speaker 2:  how it works. Apple has Apple stores and the genius bar and the whole repair

260
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:07,565
Speaker 2:  process is visible to people in the way that it's not for most other companies

261
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:11,245
Speaker 2:  and products. But if I'm not mistaken, parts pairing is kind of

262
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:15,085
Speaker 2:  everywhere, right? Like I have this vague memory of people being mad

263
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:18,925
Speaker 2:  about the Xbox disc drive being a separate thing, but

264
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:22,325
Speaker 2:  paired to the Xbox somehow in some similar way.

265
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:26,565
Speaker 6:  Yes. And PlayStations do it too. TVs very commonly have certain

266
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:30,805
Speaker 6:  paired parts. We talked about John Deere tractors earlier. It is

267
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:34,325
Speaker 6:  a tough thing to keep track of because it's not something that manufacturers

268
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:38,325
Speaker 6:  advertise. It's sort of down to the repair community and

269
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:42,365
Speaker 6:  advocates to kind of ferret this stuff out generation by generation

270
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:46,205
Speaker 6:  of these products. So it's a tricky thing to track but it, it is

271
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,125
Speaker 6:  out there. But also everyone I talk to reiterated

272
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,965
Speaker 6:  over and over again that Apple is far and away the leader in this space.

273
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:57,885
Speaker 6:  They are just, everyone is looking to them for innovation in how

274
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:01,805
Speaker 6:  to do frustrating parts, pairing type things. And you know,

275
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:05,565
Speaker 6:  the other thing is that Apple sold 230 million iPhones last year.

276
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:09,125
Speaker 6:  So it's, you know, fair. This is is super ubiquitous practice for that reason

277
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:09,525
Speaker 6:  alone,

278
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:13,005
Speaker 2:  Especially in the US Like it's, it's easy to forget this around the world

279
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,605
Speaker 2:  because the iPhone is not so dominant elsewhere. But in the US there is a

280
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:20,445
Speaker 2:  one in two chance that If you own a phone, it's an iPhone. Totally. And I

281
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:24,405
Speaker 2:  guess that is true like as Apple goes so goes so many industries at

282
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:26,405
Speaker 2:  this point I guess including the Repair industry.

283
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:30,725
Speaker 6:  Totally. And, and so If, you talk to any repair shop in the

284
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:34,605
Speaker 6:  US that's like that iPhone dominance is, is the thing that keeps

285
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:38,045
Speaker 6:  them up at night for them. The right to Repair story

286
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:40,925
Speaker 6:  often just feels like the apple parts pairing story.

287
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:45,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And there's a long history of Apple policies dictating everybody

288
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,965
Speaker 2:  else's, especially in the US on this. Did you talk to Apple about any of

289
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:51,845
Speaker 2:  this by the way Apple is like theoretically in support of all this. Did they

290
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:52,205
Speaker 2:  talk to you?

291
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:56,205
Speaker 6:  Not really. I, I did reach someone from their comms team but they didn't

292
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:57,845
Speaker 6:  wanna talk to me on the record about any of it.

293
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:01,205
Speaker 2:  I think anyone listening to The Vergecast knows how we all feel about that

294
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:05,165
Speaker 2:  over time. So let's go back to Jessa for a minute. Our, our repair

295
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:08,965
Speaker 2:  shop owner. What does she want, what do people who own

296
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:12,605
Speaker 2:  these shops want to see happen? Like what does a victory for them

297
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,005
Speaker 2:  look like in this space right now?

298
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:16,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Well I asked Jessa that exact question.

299
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,685
Speaker 8:  I would like to see the resumption

300
00:19:21,385 --> 00:19:25,005
Speaker 8:  of aftermarket technology being

301
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:29,125
Speaker 8:  accepted by the phone. you know, a lot of times like the batteries, they

302
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,645
Speaker 8:  are better than the ones that you would get in the phone. They have a little

303
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:36,045
Speaker 8:  bit of a better capacity. They last longer. They're really robust by now.

304
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:40,525
Speaker 8:  These have been out for a long time and I don't think that it's

305
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:43,285
Speaker 8:  The right message to send that it's inherently

306
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:47,565
Speaker 8:  untrustworthy, untoward or shameful to put an

307
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:50,245
Speaker 8:  aftermarket part in instead of a branded part.

308
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:54,565
Speaker 6:  And as frustrating as these legal battles have been as she's watched them,

309
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:57,205
Speaker 6:  she still sees promise in that route.

310
00:19:57,845 --> 00:20:01,685
Speaker 8:  I do like seeing these bills that have been passed and I do think that

311
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:05,565
Speaker 8:  parts pairing is a really probably the most important part of

312
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:05,965
Speaker 8:  the story.

313
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:10,805
Speaker 2:  Okay, so we have all these new rights repair laws, but it seems

314
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,765
Speaker 2:  like most of them don't address parts pairing at all and it increasingly

315
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:18,685
Speaker 2:  sounds like parts pairing is the most important part of this story.

316
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:21,365
Speaker 2:  So where are we actually at here?

317
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,725
Speaker 6:  Well, we're at pass more laws basically. Let's

318
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:25,125
Speaker 2:  Get some more

319
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,965
Speaker 6:  Laws. Yeah, always more laws and that might happen this year.

320
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:32,925
Speaker 9:  Good afternoon. And Welcome to the Senate Energy and Environment Committee.

321
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:36,885
Speaker 9:  I'm gonna open up public hearing public on Senate

322
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:40,525
Speaker 9:  bill 1596. And while you read that

323
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:41,045
Speaker 9:  I'm

324
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:44,525
Speaker 6:  Gonna go. So right now Oregon is considering a repair bill that

325
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:48,485
Speaker 6:  targets parts pairing way more directly than any of those existing

326
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:52,285
Speaker 6:  laws. I've been following the public hearings in Oregon and I talked to one

327
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:56,165
Speaker 6:  of the bill's chief sponsors, Senator Janine Salman. I asked

328
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:59,405
Speaker 6:  her, you know what it's like to get a bill like this one over the finish

329
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:02,885
Speaker 6:  line And the first thing she pointed out is that this is the fourth attempt

330
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:04,685
Speaker 6:  for a repair law in her state.

331
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:09,165
Speaker 9:  The first time it was a very broad net, it encompassed a lot

332
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:13,045
Speaker 9:  of product. And then when I got involved, the scope was narrowed and it became

333
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:17,125
Speaker 9:  the consumer items, the cell phones, the laptops and such. And

334
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:20,725
Speaker 9:  it did not even move out of the house. The third time

335
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:24,645
Speaker 9:  was last year. It did move out of Senate energy and Environment.

336
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:28,685
Speaker 9:  There was a delay in our floor session because there was

337
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:32,685
Speaker 9:  six weeks where there was a pause due to a senate walkout. So

338
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:36,285
Speaker 9:  it died and then California then passed their bill and then we started

339
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:39,805
Speaker 9:  working right after the session to really fine tune and look at

340
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:42,485
Speaker 9:  Oregon's policy, what we would be bringing forward

341
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:46,445
Speaker 6:  Forward. So it's a grind, but the fourth law has been

342
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:49,165
Speaker 6:  introduced with parts pairing language intact.

343
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:53,285
Speaker 9:  I know that the advocates feel very strongly about that. That was something

344
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:57,205
Speaker 9:  that was either never introduced in other bills or was

345
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:59,605
Speaker 9:  amended out or compromised out.

346
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:03,365
Speaker 2:  Okay. But it's in there this time. Right? What does it say exactly?

347
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:07,565
Speaker 6:  It says that manufacturers like Apple can't use parts

348
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:11,525
Speaker 6:  pairing to interfere in a repair. They can't reduce the functionality

349
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,365
Speaker 6:  or performance of a product and they can't display misleading

350
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,845
Speaker 6:  alerts or warnings about replacement parts.

351
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:21,685
Speaker 2:  I'm guessing Apple is not psyched about that specific language.

352
00:22:22,055 --> 00:22:25,845
Speaker 9:  Apple has asked us to remove it, but I strongly believe that

353
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,485
Speaker 9:  it's a consumer loss to do so.

354
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:31,325
Speaker 6:  Can you, I would love to hear anything you can tell me about your conversation

355
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:33,285
Speaker 6:  with Apple directly or indirectly.

356
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:37,485
Speaker 9:  You know, I've engaged with, with Apple many times. I met with the Apple

357
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,445
Speaker 9:  lobbyist and we kind of went over like hey these are the issues that we see

358
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:45,565
Speaker 9:  could potentially be changed. They were introduced in California,

359
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:49,485
Speaker 9:  So I took all of that in the second meeting I was told to come alone.

360
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,805
Speaker 6:  What that, that paints a picture in of itself. Yeah,

361
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,685
Speaker 2:  That's amazing. Some truly cloak and dagger

362
00:22:56,685 --> 00:22:57,285
Speaker 2:  politicking.

363
00:22:57,435 --> 00:23:01,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's ridiculous. So to their credit,

364
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:04,925
Speaker 6:  apple has gotten a little less cloak and dagger about all of it. A

365
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,845
Speaker 6:  spokesman did finally testify publicly at a hearing a couple

366
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,645
Speaker 6:  weeks ago though. He was basically just there to say, please leave parts

367
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:13,485
Speaker 6:  pairing out of this.

368
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:17,325
Speaker 10:  I'd like to begin by saying that Apple agrees with the vast majority of

369
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:21,005
Speaker 10:  Senate Bill 1596. However, it is our belief that the

370
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:24,525
Speaker 10:  bill's current language around parts pairing will undermine the security,

371
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:28,485
Speaker 10:  safety and privacy of Oregonians by forcing device manufacturers to allow

372
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:30,965
Speaker 10:  the use of parts of unknown origin and consumer devices.

373
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:35,565
Speaker 6:  So the line here is basically just that aftermarket parts are a crap shoot.

374
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:38,765
Speaker 6:  They could be good, they could be shoddy, they could be dangerous. Parts

375
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:42,725
Speaker 6:  pairing is Apple's way of steering customers away from questionable

376
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:46,365
Speaker 6:  components like Explodey batteries. They're super worried about security

377
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:48,285
Speaker 6:  features like touch ID components.

378
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:52,325
Speaker 10:  Apple could be required to allow third party biometric sensors to work in

379
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:56,165
Speaker 10:  our devices without any form of authentication, which could lead to unauthorized

380
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:58,005
Speaker 10:  access to an individual's personal data.

381
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,885
Speaker 2:  So this is a slightly different take than, than we've been talking about

382
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:05,645
Speaker 2:  with some of the parts pairing stuff, which is I think the, I have a

383
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:09,405
Speaker 2:  working Apple thing and I wanna put it in another working Apple thing

384
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:13,245
Speaker 2:  is one version of parts pairing. But I have to say I find this slightly

385
00:24:13,395 --> 00:24:17,245
Speaker 2:  more credible. The idea that you shouldn't just buy

386
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:20,725
Speaker 2:  any battery you find on Amazon. And I mean you and I have both bought

387
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:24,045
Speaker 2:  crappy things on Amazon. Remember all those hoverboards that exploded? Like

388
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:27,885
Speaker 2:  maybe protecting people from themselves is not a crazy idea. What do,

389
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,165
Speaker 2:  do you buy that argument?

390
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:33,045
Speaker 6:  It's funny, we're coming back around to the safety argument. Yeah, you're

391
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:34,685
Speaker 2:  Right. Kids in dryers.

392
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:39,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah, we're back to dismembering children. But it's, you're right

393
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:42,845
Speaker 6:  that batteries are an easy punching bag because they fail and sometimes they

394
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:46,765
Speaker 6:  fail catastrophically. So as a DIY repair

395
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:50,325
Speaker 6:  person, you absolutely should do your homework and find a trusted

396
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:54,365
Speaker 6:  supplier of an aftermarket battery or you should go to a trusted

397
00:24:54,385 --> 00:24:58,325
Speaker 6:  repair shop. As for the kind of rogue fingerprint sensor

398
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:02,285
Speaker 6:  that can hack your phone. Hmm. I talked to a security expert and they

399
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:05,205
Speaker 6:  said it was possible but really farfetched.

400
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,325
Speaker 2:  It sounds scary. It's a good like visceral example.

401
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:12,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean it falls really neatly into the category of what

402
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:16,565
Speaker 6:  advocates refer to derisively as Fudd or fear

403
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,645
Speaker 6:  uncertainty and doubt. Which is just a very diffuse

404
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:25,245
Speaker 6:  tactic for people who want to scare you away from a thing. It kind of

405
00:25:25,245 --> 00:25:29,005
Speaker 6:  does go back to the issue though of just finding a good repair shop and a

406
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:32,125
Speaker 6:  good aftermarket supplier. Yeah. That's that not gonna sell you a super sketchy

407
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:36,085
Speaker 6:  part and that is just a leap that Apple doesn't want customers

408
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:40,125
Speaker 6:  to have to make basically. So that's Apple's take on

409
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,925
Speaker 6:  the Oregon bill. But the other notable thing about this bill in particular

410
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:48,045
Speaker 6:  is Google used it as an opportunity to come out fully in support of Right

411
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:51,765
Speaker 6:  to Repair, including all of the parts pairing stuff in this Oregon bill.

412
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:55,605
Speaker 6:  Hmm. And they're basically using this bill to loudly say,

413
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:59,885
Speaker 6:  yes you can have a hardware business without controlling what goes

414
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:01,285
Speaker 6:  into that hardware after the fact.

415
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:04,365
Speaker 11:  I can't speak as well to that 'cause that's simply something that we do

416
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:04,725
Speaker 11:  not do

417
00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:08,525
Speaker 6:  That is Google's head of consumer hardware, Steven Nickel on a call with

418
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:08,965
Speaker 6:  me last week.

419
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:12,885
Speaker 11:  You can have that quality, you can have that safety with your

420
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:16,685
Speaker 11:  repairs processes that we implement and not be concerned about it. Right?

421
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:20,525
Speaker 11:  We work with really good repair providers. We also make the process as

422
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:23,085
Speaker 11:  simple as possible so we're not as concerned.

423
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:27,365
Speaker 6:  So obviously Steven knows that taking this more relaxed approach means

424
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:31,005
Speaker 6:  that more aftermarket parts are gonna find their way into Google products.

425
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:34,965
Speaker 6:  But here again, he just didn't project any worry about it.

426
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:39,285
Speaker 11:  We want you to have that best experience. And so, you know, we believe

427
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:43,125
Speaker 11:  that best experience means authorized parts. We know that other parts

428
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:47,205
Speaker 11:  are out there, third party parts for various aspects, right? But continually,

429
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:51,165
Speaker 11:  we believe if we put out this experience and we make authorized parts available,

430
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:54,205
Speaker 11:  accessible and affordable, you're gonna select those, right?

431
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:58,405
Speaker 6:  So that is basically where things stand at the moment.

432
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:02,565
Speaker 6:  Google and Apple both support the basic concepts

433
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:06,445
Speaker 6:  in these repair bills and now they are duking it out with lawmakers over

434
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:10,805
Speaker 6:  specifics like parts pairing, which is not super satisfying for

435
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:14,165
Speaker 6:  shop owners like Jessa. It's slow moving, it's precarious,

436
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:18,725
Speaker 6:  but everyone involved is starting to reach the marrow

437
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:22,445
Speaker 6:  of this debate. And along the way Senator Solomon is noticing that same

438
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:26,325
Speaker 6:  shift that Nathan Proctor and other advocates are seeing in the industry.

439
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:30,805
Speaker 6:  This really slow but steady realization that

440
00:27:31,205 --> 00:27:33,965
Speaker 6:  opposing repair laws just isn't a good look.

441
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:38,045
Speaker 9:  You know, having folks that have been at the table but are now neutral,

442
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:41,205
Speaker 9:  having Amazon Neutral, having Intel neutral,

443
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:45,765
Speaker 9:  Microsoft, OBI, which is the Oregon business and industry which has been

444
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:50,045
Speaker 9:  in opposition is now neutral. So this policy is coming and

445
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:52,605
Speaker 9:  I'm really excited to to be one of the ones to bring that forward.

446
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:56,725
Speaker 6:  Gotcha. So to be clear, getting to neutral is the win because all of those

447
00:27:56,845 --> 00:27:58,525
Speaker 6:  groups were in opposition. Yeah,

448
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,765
Speaker 9:  It's an absolute win.

449
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:03,765
Speaker 2:  This goes back to something Kyle said to us last year, which is basically

450
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:07,525
Speaker 2:  that the big shift was making it very hard

451
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:11,485
Speaker 2:  for someone to credibly loudly be against right? to Repair.

452
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:15,125
Speaker 2:  And it does feel like that has shifted that we've gone from sort of a

453
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:19,245
Speaker 2:  reasonable people can disagree way of thinking about this stuff to right

454
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:22,845
Speaker 2:  to Repair is, is The right idea? And we can argue about the details of it,

455
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:26,525
Speaker 2:  but this is clearly how it should work. And I think at this point that

456
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:29,245
Speaker 2:  particular battle does seem like it has been won.

457
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:33,525
Speaker 6:  It absolutely has. And everyone I talked to said the same thing

458
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:37,485
Speaker 6:  that 10 years ago it was perfectly acceptable for a manufacturer

459
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:41,245
Speaker 6:  to say, no, we know best. We own this entire

460
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:44,685
Speaker 6:  process, this is how we operate. There was no

461
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:48,925
Speaker 6:  pressure to even give lip service to this idea.

462
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:52,605
Speaker 6:  And if nothing else, there is now a lot of pressure to give lip service to

463
00:28:52,685 --> 00:28:53,605
Speaker 6:  this idea. Right?

464
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:55,765
Speaker 2:  You have to at least pretend to care now.

465
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:59,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And then And now it's the whole battle is going from

466
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:03,245
Speaker 6:  pretending to care to if not actually caring, being

467
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:07,125
Speaker 6:  forced to participate in ways that are really meaningful. Right? And

468
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:11,285
Speaker 2:  Figurine out how all of this is actually supposed to play out in the

469
00:29:11,365 --> 00:29:15,245
Speaker 2:  real world. We're still at the phase of if my phone breaks, where am I

470
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:18,485
Speaker 2:  supposed to go and what am I supposed to do? But that's a much more interesting

471
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:22,125
Speaker 2:  next phase I think than am I allowed to fix my own phone? Yes.

472
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:26,365
Speaker 2:  It also seems like that is leading us to the next question, which is basically

473
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:30,125
Speaker 2:  like how is all of this supposed to work in the real world? Because I'm also

474
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:33,525
Speaker 2:  increasingly aware of the fact that everything we own is technology and everything

475
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:37,365
Speaker 2:  we own breaks in new spectacular ways. And so we're gonna need

476
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:40,965
Speaker 2:  this big vibrant repair ecosystem and we figured out

477
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:44,285
Speaker 2:  like very little of it yet, but at least we can get to the work of figurine

478
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:48,205
Speaker 2:  out how it's all supposed to work as opposed to figurine out whether we're

479
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:49,165
Speaker 2:  allowed to do it right.

480
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:53,525
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. And it's a very good point that like as smartphones go

481
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:57,325
Speaker 6:  today, so could go a lot of different things in The future. Yeah.

482
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:01,485
Speaker 6:  So I wanted one last perspective on this, which is the Zoom all

483
00:30:01,485 --> 00:30:04,605
Speaker 6:  the way out. Why is this gonna matter to everyone in The future perspective?

484
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,925
Speaker 6:  So I called up someone who thinks a lot about how to keep all of this

485
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:10,405
Speaker 6:  technology working for us.

486
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:14,525
Speaker 12:  My name is Stacey Higginbotham, I am a policy fellow at Consumer Reports.

487
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:18,925
Speaker 6:  Stacey spent years reporting on the internet of things. So when

488
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:22,885
Speaker 6:  she looks at a technology like parts pairing, she sees trouble ahead for

489
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:24,125
Speaker 6:  a lot more than cell phones.

490
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:28,325
Speaker 12:  We're adding software to a lot more products that historically

491
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:31,845
Speaker 12:  haven't had software in them. A good example would be your home

492
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:35,645
Speaker 12:  appliances. Your current home appliances may not have like a wifi

493
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:38,765
Speaker 12:  chip in them and they may not have a lot of software that allows them to

494
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:42,645
Speaker 12:  do cool features, but your next one probably will. Those companies are

495
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:46,245
Speaker 12:  learning from what Apple's doing and they're going to be implementing similar

496
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:50,165
Speaker 12:  sorts of software pairing techniques to make these devices

497
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:54,325
Speaker 12:  less repairable by third parties, but also just less

498
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:58,165
Speaker 12:  something that the consumer themselves has ownership of. If that

499
00:30:58,165 --> 00:31:01,525
Speaker 12:  makes sense. And that's the big risk here I think with software pairing

500
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:05,325
Speaker 12:  is that it's not gonna stop with your phones, it's gonna go to everything

501
00:31:05,325 --> 00:31:09,005
Speaker 12:  because as we connect our devices to the internet, they get not just

502
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:12,885
Speaker 12:  radios, they get software and cool features and you're

503
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:16,125
Speaker 12:  gonna lose control over a lot of that going forward.

504
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:21,045
Speaker 2:  Okay. So you've just brought up the like big huge galaxy

505
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,925
Speaker 2:  brain sized question behind all of this, which is do we actually

506
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:28,965
Speaker 2:  own the stuff that we buy? And like we cannot get into

507
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:32,805
Speaker 2:  that now because dear God, the things that we'll do to me in

508
00:31:32,805 --> 00:31:36,365
Speaker 2:  this episode. But that does feel like this question, right? All of this

509
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:40,365
Speaker 2:  boils down to like, is my iPhone, my car, my

510
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:44,525
Speaker 2:  dishwasher? Like is that mine to do with as I please? Or am I

511
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:47,645
Speaker 2:  essentially operating something under someone else's purview?

512
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:51,845
Speaker 6:  Exactly. And iPhones are just far enough out ahead of all

513
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:55,685
Speaker 6:  of this that it is easy to look at them and start to go like, oh,

514
00:31:55,685 --> 00:31:58,805
Speaker 6:  what if the whole world worked like that? And so that's what we're doing

515
00:31:58,805 --> 00:32:02,605
Speaker 6:  right now with consumer electronics like iPhones and it's

516
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:06,485
Speaker 6:  what a lot of this right to repair movement really boils down to

517
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:07,725
Speaker 6:  in the end. Okay.

518
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,965
Speaker 2:  So someday, very soon you're gonna come back here and we're just gonna get

519
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:14,245
Speaker 2:  deep in our feelings about ownership and I'm gonna yell about Kindle books

520
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:17,165
Speaker 2:  getting removed from Kindles and it's gonna be a whole thing. Yep. But for

521
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:20,565
Speaker 2:  now, you mentioned more laws we're gonna cover right to Repair a lot this

522
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:24,045
Speaker 2:  year. I actually think this is like one of the big sort of trundling along

523
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:27,805
Speaker 2:  in the background stories in this industry and you're deep in it now. You're

524
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:31,445
Speaker 2:  gonna keep covering it for us, but set the stage for the rest of the year

525
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:34,285
Speaker 2:  for us a little bit. What is 2024 gonna look like in this space?

526
00:32:34,755 --> 00:32:38,525
Speaker 6:  Well, we're gonna have to see, it's really hard to predict what

527
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:41,605
Speaker 6:  happens with all of these different bills. So I'm gonna be following what's

528
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:45,125
Speaker 6:  going on in Oregon. That bill that we talked about just passed out of committee.

529
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:49,325
Speaker 6:  It's headed for the full Senate in Oregon right now. So we'll see

530
00:32:49,355 --> 00:32:53,325
Speaker 6:  what kinda legs, lucky number four in Oregon looks like I'll

531
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:56,805
Speaker 6:  keep track of other state bills and I wanna just keep talking to Repair shop

532
00:32:56,805 --> 00:33:00,605
Speaker 6:  owners and DIY folks because parts pairing is really important

533
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:04,445
Speaker 6:  for them. But there's a ton of other stuff that they're grappling with every

534
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:08,205
Speaker 6:  day that is very closely connected to The, right to Repair that has

535
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:11,845
Speaker 6:  nothing to do with anything that regulators are trying to tackle right now.

536
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:16,005
Speaker 6:  So there's just a lot more going on here. And as you say, I think

537
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:19,885
Speaker 6:  this year is gonna be a big year both for the

538
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:23,525
Speaker 6:  laws and for people asking those, those even larger questions.

539
00:33:24,075 --> 00:33:26,525
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. How should the people get in touch with you? Like we said, you're

540
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:29,645
Speaker 2:  gonna be covering this all year, If, you are run a shop and want to talk

541
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:32,645
Speaker 2:  about it or just have feelings about your iPhone screens. How should, how

542
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:33,405
Speaker 2:  should people find you?

543
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:37,565
Speaker 6:  Oh, email me, William dot poor@voxmedia.com and

544
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:41,245
Speaker 6:  I will check back here when I learn more about all those things.

545
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:43,805
Speaker 2:  Awesome, thanks. Will appreciate it as always. Yeah,

546
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:44,365
Speaker 6:  Absolutely.

547
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:47,565
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're

548
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:51,125
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about some big and slightly confusing news from

549
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,325
Speaker 2:  Microsoft. We'll be

550
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:52,765
Speaker 4:  Right back.

551
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:02,925
Speaker 13:  safely.

552
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:11,235
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So we talked a little bit about this on Friday's show, but

553
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:15,315
Speaker 2:  Microsoft made some big gaming news last week that was also kind of

554
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:19,515
Speaker 2:  small news. The company announced a couple of new bits of information

555
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:23,395
Speaker 2:  about how game streaming and Game Pass are doing, but also said that it's

556
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:27,235
Speaker 2:  gonna take four games which have previously been Xbox exclusives and make

557
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:30,715
Speaker 2:  them available on the PlayStation and the switch in and of itself. This is

558
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:34,555
Speaker 2:  not like earth shattering News, it's a couple of games in a couple

559
00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:38,475
Speaker 2:  of new places, but there's something bigger going on underneath

560
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:42,475
Speaker 2:  all of this. And The Verge is Tom Warren, I guarantee you knows

561
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:46,435
Speaker 2:  what, it's Tom Warren Welcome back to The Vergecast. Hello. You have had

562
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:47,315
Speaker 2:  a week my friend.

563
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:49,195
Speaker 14:  I have. It's been an Xbox week.

564
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:52,515
Speaker 2:  I feel like Microsoft likes to do this to you every once in a while where

565
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:55,475
Speaker 2:  they're just like, for five straight days we're gonna ruin Tom's life.

566
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:59,195
Speaker 14:  They're like, Tom is, it's his birthday so we're just gonna mess up his

567
00:36:59,195 --> 00:37:03,075
Speaker 14:  week. But all the times that he's messed up our weeks let's

568
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:03,435
Speaker 14:  back. Yeah,

569
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:06,555
Speaker 2:  It's kind of him. Yeah. So okay, so let's talk about the news, which will

570
00:37:06,555 --> 00:37:10,035
Speaker 2:  take us not very long. And then I wanna talk about all the stuff

571
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:13,715
Speaker 2:  underneath the news because this is very much sort of the, the tip of the

572
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:17,275
Speaker 2:  iceberg above the water kind of moment for, for Microsoft and Xbox So, I

573
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:20,875
Speaker 2:  wanna talk about all of that. But the news of this podcast,

574
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:24,955
Speaker 2:  which is just the funniest way ever for Microsoft to release this news. What

575
00:37:24,955 --> 00:37:28,475
Speaker 2:  new stuff did we get from this Microsoft announcement on Thursday?

576
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:31,875
Speaker 14:  Yeah, I mean the, the big news is obviously the stuff that's been rumored

577
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,595
Speaker 14:  for weeks or months now and that is the Microsoft bringing four

578
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:39,395
Speaker 14:  games, which they're not actually naming, we'll get into that,

579
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:43,915
Speaker 14:  but four games to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch or

580
00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:46,515
Speaker 14:  Nintendo Switch. I don't think every single of those games will come to

581
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:50,435
Speaker 14:  both as far as I'm aware. But yeah, four games on multiple

582
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:54,555
Speaker 14:  platforms essentially. Now obviously Microsoft does publish, you know, Minecraft

583
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:57,195
Speaker 14:  and games like that and they're gonna be publishing Call of Duty now 'cause

584
00:37:57,195 --> 00:38:00,435
Speaker 14:  of Activision Blizzard on multiple platforms. But I still think this is

585
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:04,275
Speaker 14:  still, although they downplayed it, I still think it's pretty seismic. Like

586
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:07,995
Speaker 14:  it's, you know, putting your Xbox exclusive games that

587
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:11,795
Speaker 14:  people have purchased on Xbox onto rival platforms is

588
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:15,515
Speaker 14:  definitely a strategy shift. Even if they framed it as just four

589
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:18,635
Speaker 14:  for now we're just gonna, you know, take some learnings out of it and stuff.

590
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:22,675
Speaker 14:  But that, that was the big news and then they kind of softened

591
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,595
Speaker 14:  the blow of that because obviously they knew it was gonna be pretty controversial

592
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:30,315
Speaker 14:  amongst exports fans and like doom and gloom with the fact that

593
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:33,915
Speaker 14:  they're working on a next generation console, which you know, you'd expect

594
00:38:33,915 --> 00:38:36,965
Speaker 14:  them to be right. But they, they're saying it's gonna be, you know, some

595
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:40,485
Speaker 14:  giant technical leap. So it's, we'll see what happens there. Other than

596
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,965
Speaker 14:  that there was the first Activision Blizzard game, Diablo four coming to

597
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:47,685
Speaker 14:  Game Pass, a sort of reaffirmation of Game Pass being, you know,

598
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:51,165
Speaker 14:  games being day one on Game Pass and then just this kind of light

599
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:55,125
Speaker 14:  sort of theme throughout it of bringing the games to players where they're

600
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,125
Speaker 14:  at. you know that that that very much that multi-platform thing. So

601
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:02,285
Speaker 2:  Right. So, and that seems to me like the big picture underneath

602
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:06,485
Speaker 2:  all of this and and my sense is Microsoft would very much like you

603
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:10,125
Speaker 2:  to think that it's just sort of running an experiment, just trying

604
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:14,245
Speaker 2:  some things, seeing what happens. Let's just put some games out. Who

605
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:17,085
Speaker 2:  knows what'll happen but underneath you get the sense that this is like,

606
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:21,205
Speaker 2:  this is a moment for Microsoft that is much bigger than

607
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:24,805
Speaker 2:  it would have you believe. So like dig all the way down to the bottom of

608
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:28,605
Speaker 2:  the iceberg here. Like what is this sort of big picture thing that Xbox

609
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:31,245
Speaker 2:  is trying to do? You get this leaked memo from Phil Spencer that I think

610
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:35,645
Speaker 2:  kind of seems to lay it out in bigger picture terms but even that might

611
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:38,605
Speaker 2:  be downplaying it slightly. Like paint me the biggest version of this picture

612
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:38,885
Speaker 2:  here.

613
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:42,765
Speaker 14:  So I. Think we have to, to paint the picture, we have to understand why

614
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:45,645
Speaker 14:  they would even do this in the first place, right? 'cause it sounds If you

615
00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:49,685
Speaker 14:  said it's a year ago, people would be like, no way, they're not gonna bring

616
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:53,365
Speaker 14:  exports games to Station that's just like, you know, conspiracy theory or

617
00:39:53,485 --> 00:39:57,325
Speaker 14:  whatever. But If you look like, so two, two years ago they obviously announced

618
00:39:57,325 --> 00:40:01,285
Speaker 14:  the acquisition Activision Blizzard at the time they had 25 million Game

619
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:04,125
Speaker 14:  Pass subscribers and they announced that since then we've never heard anything

620
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:07,805
Speaker 14:  more about how many Game Pass subscribers they've had at the time. They

621
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:11,485
Speaker 14:  were kind of pushing Game Pass as the reason to buy an export series s and

622
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:15,365
Speaker 14:  x. They launched the series s as a $300 console. That was kind of

623
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:18,685
Speaker 14:  the game pass console, right? That you buy that to to get the Game Pass

624
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:22,045
Speaker 14:  subscription. That was the way in right. Sales of those consoles haven't

625
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:25,645
Speaker 14:  gone as well as Microsoft hoped. We've seen that, that they're still lagging

626
00:40:26,065 --> 00:40:29,845
Speaker 14:  far behind the PS five and Game Pass has stalled. So Phil

627
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:33,405
Speaker 14:  Spencer admitted that in like late 2022, so probably

628
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:37,485
Speaker 14:  about about 10 months or so after they, they announced that 25 million

629
00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:40,525
Speaker 2:  And I think you can fairly safely assume that the fact that we have not heard

630
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:43,925
Speaker 2:  much since then is not a sign that it has massively turned around

631
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:47,365
Speaker 14:  Not good news. Yeah. But the one thing we didn't mention with the, the news

632
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:49,685
Speaker 14:  is that they actually said 34 million now.

633
00:40:49,785 --> 00:40:50,645
Speaker 2:  Oh interesting. Okay.

634
00:40:50,655 --> 00:40:53,645
Speaker 14:  Which was pretty much spot on what analysts said. They said

635
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:57,205
Speaker 14:  33.3 million. So it's like very close. That

636
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,925
Speaker 14:  includes Game Pass Core, which used to be exports Live Gold.

637
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:04,925
Speaker 14:  So that is an interesting part as well. But when you take that

638
00:41:05,115 --> 00:41:08,765
Speaker 14:  example of Game Pass stalling, Microsoft needs to find revenue growth

639
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:12,445
Speaker 14:  elsewhere if they're not selling the consoles and, and getting that user

640
00:41:12,475 --> 00:41:15,725
Speaker 14:  base up so they can sell, you know, the, the micro

641
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:19,365
Speaker 14:  transactions, the gains, all the in-game content, everything else you need

642
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:22,245
Speaker 14:  to find revenue from elsewhere, right? You still need to grow and Microsoft

643
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:24,925
Speaker 14:  needs to grow, especially when they're, they're putting so much money on

644
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:28,885
Speaker 14:  the line for these studios. So I think that's the main driver behind

645
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:32,485
Speaker 14:  this. And you are right, like they're, they're framing it like it's a test,

646
00:41:32,485 --> 00:41:35,205
Speaker 14:  right? They're gonna learn and I'm, I'm sure yeah, they'll, they'll learn

647
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:38,805
Speaker 14:  a bunch of stuff but they've already been publishing on PlayStation and

648
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:42,645
Speaker 14:  Nintendo for, for years now. So there's not a lot of learnings that they,

649
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:45,525
Speaker 14:  they're gonna pick up there that they don't already know. So

650
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,565
Speaker 2:  If I'm Microsoft, it feels like you, you take kind of the last couple of

651
00:41:48,565 --> 00:41:52,525
Speaker 2:  years and you can, you can do one of two things. You can either say we believe

652
00:41:52,955 --> 00:41:56,765
Speaker 2:  that streaming and cloud and Game Pass is The

653
00:41:56,765 --> 00:42:00,485
Speaker 2:  future. We, we think we're early. Microsoft has a really long history of

654
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:04,005
Speaker 2:  being slightly too early to really good ideas. Yes. But we are gonna keep

655
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,605
Speaker 2:  pushing on this and they've talked a lot about how they're in third place

656
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:10,325
Speaker 2:  and this is the way to win the next generation. And so if you're Phil Spencer,

657
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:13,685
Speaker 2:  there's a version of this story where you say the only way out is through,

658
00:42:13,685 --> 00:42:17,485
Speaker 2:  right? Yes. The other side is to say maybe this isn't

659
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:21,085
Speaker 2:  working and then to say, okay, let's go back to something that feels

660
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:24,885
Speaker 2:  more like a way that you can actually make money in the gaming industry.

661
00:42:24,915 --> 00:42:27,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And the two ways to do that are either make games that people buy on

662
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:31,445
Speaker 2:  lots of platforms or make a gaming platform on which people

663
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:35,165
Speaker 2:  buy your hardware and play your games. And it feels like Microsoft is

664
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:39,085
Speaker 2:  wanting to say that it's still on the streaming is The future

665
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:42,885
Speaker 2:  side of things, but it's kind of like trenching back towards this like very

666
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:44,685
Speaker 2:  normal way of running a gaming business.

667
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:47,885
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And that's, that's a good point. Like the, the cloud stuff is also

668
00:42:47,885 --> 00:42:51,605
Speaker 14:  a big part of this as well because they, they kind of bet on cloud being

669
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:55,525
Speaker 14:  bigger than it perhaps has been or, or will be potentially in

670
00:42:55,525 --> 00:42:57,845
Speaker 14:  the next sort of five years. Essentially. They've had, they've also had

671
00:42:57,845 --> 00:43:01,125
Speaker 14:  this vision of exports everywhere, right? Like on on every screen or whatever,

672
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,805
Speaker 14:  which we've heard them saying is leak memo, it's always been that vision

673
00:43:05,035 --> 00:43:08,845
Speaker 14:  like on PCs, on consoles, on cloud, you know,

674
00:43:08,845 --> 00:43:12,205
Speaker 14:  getting it to mobile devices through streaming. That's always been that

675
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:16,085
Speaker 14:  vision. They've just kind of tweaked it to now include PlayStation and

676
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:20,045
Speaker 14:  Nintendo Switch as targets for that, for that vision. Something that I haven't

677
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:23,525
Speaker 14:  seen anyone's kind of picked up on or I haven't written about it, I probably

678
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:26,885
Speaker 14:  should. But If you think about this when you, when you publish a game on,

679
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:30,565
Speaker 14:  on a, on a rival platform, say like Blizzard, they publish like

680
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:34,325
Speaker 14:  Overwatch on multiple platforms. You sign in with your blizzard ID

681
00:43:34,465 --> 00:43:38,165
Speaker 14:  to to get into that game. That gives you cross progression and, and all

682
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:41,525
Speaker 14:  sorts of account link and stuff. Once, if Microsoft does that with its games

683
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:45,125
Speaker 14:  that it brings to PlayStation switch, like it requires an account where

684
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:49,085
Speaker 14:  you get some of that e exports ecosystem, the cross saves and If,

685
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,605
Speaker 14:  you do wanna buy an exports, then all your saves are there. All that sort

686
00:43:51,605 --> 00:43:54,725
Speaker 14:  of stuff that they, they constantly talk about. And once if they do

687
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:59,005
Speaker 14:  eventually then start selling subscriptions to give you in-game stuff

688
00:43:59,185 --> 00:44:03,165
Speaker 14:  or like perks and and stuff for those games. I don't know exactly

689
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:06,765
Speaker 14:  how that'll work in terms of the platform holders allowing that, but it's

690
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:10,285
Speaker 14:  a possibility that these could even be like tro horse games for for, for

691
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:13,165
Speaker 14:  something like that down the line. 'cause they know they can't get Game

692
00:44:13,165 --> 00:44:16,365
Speaker 14:  Pass natively on those con on those consoles 'cause they, Sony's gonna want

693
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:20,325
Speaker 14:  their folks in cart. Nintendo is and just like Microsoft would if, if

694
00:44:20,445 --> 00:44:23,525
Speaker 14:  it was the other way around. So I do feel like there, there's a possibility

695
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:26,605
Speaker 14:  that they might be able to work around some stuff with the account stuff.

696
00:44:26,855 --> 00:44:27,365
Speaker 14:  We'll see

697
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:30,485
Speaker 2:  That's interesting and, and so maybe I'm not giving Microsoft enough sort

698
00:44:30,485 --> 00:44:34,245
Speaker 2:  of vision credit there that maybe they're not just pulling back to,

699
00:44:34,345 --> 00:44:37,045
Speaker 2:  we have to sell people video games because that's how you make money in the

700
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:39,685
Speaker 2:  gaming business is by selling people video games. Right. And we have to do

701
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:43,205
Speaker 2:  it any way possible that they can do a little bit of that while also still

702
00:44:43,205 --> 00:44:46,925
Speaker 2:  pushing on this Xbox everywhere, every

703
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:50,285
Speaker 2:  screen should be an Xbox kind of strategy. Which like it'll actually I think

704
00:44:50,285 --> 00:44:54,205
Speaker 2:  is The right strategy. I think it's again, it, it seems like Microsoft is

705
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:58,045
Speaker 2:  early here and whether it can survive how early it is remains

706
00:44:58,045 --> 00:45:01,925
Speaker 2:  to be seen. but it does feel like that ought to be where all of this

707
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:05,085
Speaker 2:  goes. And maybe Microsoft isn't giving up on that entirely by doing this.

708
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:09,525
Speaker 14:  No and I think a part of it is also they, they obviously Game Pass was pretty

709
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:13,365
Speaker 14:  disruptive. It was de definitely something that kind of shook up the, the

710
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:16,245
Speaker 14:  industry a little bit. It definitely made Sony respond, right? They they,

711
00:45:16,245 --> 00:45:19,965
Speaker 14:  they responded with with subscriptions beyond what they were offering.

712
00:45:20,305 --> 00:45:23,165
Speaker 14:  And I do wonder if that's kind of Microsoft's plan here as well is like

713
00:45:23,165 --> 00:45:27,045
Speaker 14:  to try and shake up this idea exclusivity. 'cause obviously we saw the

714
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:30,685
Speaker 14:  Sony president announce just hours funny enough before

715
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:34,845
Speaker 14:  Microsoft's event that they wanted to aggressively pursue multi-platform

716
00:45:34,905 --> 00:45:37,645
Speaker 14:  or that that's the way they say it. But I think the way that you can really

717
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:41,005
Speaker 14:  understand that is is pc, 'cause he did mention computers in particular

718
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:45,125
Speaker 14:  So I think that's more them saying they want to be day and date on

719
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:48,925
Speaker 14:  PC more often 'cause there's money to be had there, right? Like hell

720
00:45:49,385 --> 00:45:53,365
Speaker 14:  two came out recently and it's, it's doing massive amounts and I think

721
00:45:53,365 --> 00:45:56,605
Speaker 14:  this is Microsoft kind of saying Sony you should probably do this as well,

722
00:45:56,605 --> 00:45:59,925
Speaker 14:  you know, like do it on PC and I don't know whether we'll see Sony do

723
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:03,805
Speaker 14:  PlayStation games on exports anytime soon. But the other part of

724
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:07,725
Speaker 14:  all of this with, if people are all publishing on different rival

725
00:46:08,085 --> 00:46:11,365
Speaker 14:  platforms and stuff, it's just vows just sitting there sort of laughing,

726
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:14,765
Speaker 14:  right? Yeah, true. They've got all the exclusives they want, right? They

727
00:46:14,765 --> 00:46:16,845
Speaker 14:  they're getting the PlayStation ones, they're getting the, the Microsoft

728
00:46:16,845 --> 00:46:19,845
Speaker 14:  ones, they're not getting the Nintendo ones unless Nintendo does PC games,

729
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:23,605
Speaker 14:  which I do think they should. But they are building quietly building

730
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:27,725
Speaker 14:  the steam deck and Linux platform to rival Windows and that's one of

731
00:46:27,725 --> 00:46:31,205
Speaker 14:  the, the last touch points of Windows for consumers is gaming, right? Like

732
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,925
Speaker 14:  if Microsoft loses that they lose a lot of consumer in really

733
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:37,405
Speaker 14:  if that goes away, So I think there's, there's definitely a part of that

734
00:46:37,405 --> 00:46:41,285
Speaker 14:  as well that Microsoft's looking towards. They're seeing what

735
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:44,605
Speaker 14:  Vows doing in that strategy there. There's a possibility that we could have

736
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:48,445
Speaker 14:  gaming consoles that are steam decks, right? They are basically

737
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:50,685
Speaker 14:  a game console now so you can plug it into your tv.

738
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:54,685
Speaker 2:  Well and speaking of that, we were sort of anticipating potentially getting

739
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:58,325
Speaker 2:  some big hardware announcement. We've been waiting for the Xbox handheld

740
00:46:58,325 --> 00:47:01,845
Speaker 2:  for what feels like years now and we didn't get one

741
00:47:02,145 --> 00:47:05,845
Speaker 2:  but you asked Phil Spencer about it and I would describe the answer he gave

742
00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:09,565
Speaker 2:  you as the closest thing to saying yes we're building a

743
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:13,325
Speaker 2:  handheld that he could possibly say without saying the words Yes we're building

744
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:15,405
Speaker 2:  a handheld. Was that your read of of what's going on?

745
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:18,725
Speaker 14:  Yeah and that was my, because he said like unique hardware, right? Like

746
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:21,965
Speaker 14:  and positioning the hardware teams to sort of design in a way that they

747
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:25,045
Speaker 14:  haven't before And obviously they're gonna have to create unique hardware

748
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:28,365
Speaker 14:  if, if they are putting more of these games across platform. You need, you

749
00:47:28,365 --> 00:47:32,165
Speaker 14:  need to have the hardware be some some sort of unique thing. So that

750
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:35,405
Speaker 14:  doesn't seem too surprising. But yeah I did ask him 'cause he always likes

751
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:38,365
Speaker 14:  a bunch of people's tweets about handhelds so I'm like, it's

752
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:39,805
Speaker 2:  Such a funny strategy. I love

753
00:47:39,805 --> 00:47:42,965
Speaker 14:  It. It's so obvious, right? Like he's obviously trying to say something

754
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:46,205
Speaker 14:  but, and I think part of it is they obviously have to improve the Windows

755
00:47:46,605 --> 00:47:49,965
Speaker 14:  situation on handhelds so there's competitors to Steam Deck. But yeah, like

756
00:47:49,965 --> 00:47:53,805
Speaker 14:  the exports handheld itself, I'm very curious if they, if they do that

757
00:47:54,265 --> 00:47:58,045
Speaker 14:  and when and on what sort of platform that runs. 'cause I,

758
00:47:58,165 --> 00:48:02,045
Speaker 14:  I think the, the most ideal thing that they could do, which they could

759
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,205
Speaker 14:  technically do is just whether they could put all these things together

760
00:48:05,585 --> 00:48:09,485
Speaker 14:  is have it run Windows but never expose Windows. Like Steam Deck

761
00:48:09,505 --> 00:48:12,925
Speaker 14:  has Linux and doesn't really expose it unless you want to go into the desktop

762
00:48:13,305 --> 00:48:17,205
Speaker 14:  but then have it run the virtual machine of exports os on top so you can

763
00:48:17,205 --> 00:48:20,245
Speaker 14:  get exports games on it. 'cause then you don't have to worry about the PC

764
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:24,205
Speaker 14:  game pass store and the Microsoft store and which isn't very good on

765
00:48:24,465 --> 00:48:27,045
Speaker 14:  pc and then you get the best, best of both worlds, right? You can still

766
00:48:27,045 --> 00:48:30,605
Speaker 14:  play steam games on it as well. Like that would be If you wanted to sell

767
00:48:30,605 --> 00:48:33,925
Speaker 14:  me a steam deck that was running. That would be, I think a lot of people

768
00:48:33,925 --> 00:48:34,445
Speaker 14:  would buy that.

769
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:38,245
Speaker 2:  I think so too. Well, and this goes back to one of the strangest

770
00:48:38,605 --> 00:48:41,805
Speaker 2:  Microsoft strategies to me and I I, you and I have talked about this before,

771
00:48:41,805 --> 00:48:44,765
Speaker 2:  but I'm curious how you're thinking about it now, which is Microsoft never

772
00:48:44,765 --> 00:48:48,125
Speaker 2:  seems to be able to decide whether it wants to make its own hardware and

773
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,925
Speaker 2:  it, it kind of vacillates in and out between betting really big on surface

774
00:48:52,025 --> 00:48:54,565
Speaker 2:  and doing some really interesting work and really changing the PC industry

775
00:48:54,905 --> 00:48:58,605
Speaker 2:  and then this sort of pull back from the innovation there, which,

776
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:02,405
Speaker 2:  you know, caused Panos pane to leave and some other machinations going on

777
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:06,205
Speaker 2:  there. but it seems like if I'm Microsoft and I am all in on the hardware

778
00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:10,045
Speaker 2:  business, they should have built more Xbox stuff by now. So

779
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:12,965
Speaker 2:  it seems like there's, there's one way to read that that's like, well these

780
00:49:12,965 --> 00:49:16,565
Speaker 2:  two things are too obvious to have not been together by now. Right. If

781
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:20,765
Speaker 2:  Microsoft actually cared about doing this and if you're taking the Windows

782
00:49:21,245 --> 00:49:24,845
Speaker 2:  strategy, you just kind of are happy running on partner devices rather than

783
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:28,085
Speaker 2:  trying to build your own. Yeah. But then it is pretty obvious that they're

784
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:31,605
Speaker 2:  building a handheld. So like what do you make of this? Like, does Phil Spencer

785
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:34,925
Speaker 2:  wanna build this hardware or is he trying to like start an ecosystem of hardware

786
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:36,005
Speaker 2:  that he can just put his games on.

787
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:40,445
Speaker 14:  I think ultimately they probably do wanna build the hardware. Okay. There'll

788
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:43,645
Speaker 14:  probably be some sort of combination of the Surface team doing that or helping

789
00:49:43,665 --> 00:49:45,845
Speaker 14:  out with it. 'cause they, they kind of help out with some of the export

790
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:49,525
Speaker 14:  stuff anyway. And a lot of the lab testing is kinda shared. But yeah, like

791
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:52,725
Speaker 14:  I, I do think they'll build it. It's just, it comes back to the question

792
00:49:52,725 --> 00:49:55,925
Speaker 14:  of what platform would it run on? And I think that speaks to probably why

793
00:49:55,925 --> 00:49:58,845
Speaker 14:  they haven't done it before. There's been that weird, like there always

794
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:02,645
Speaker 14:  this weird split between exports and, and PC stuff and Microsoft's always

795
00:50:02,645 --> 00:50:06,405
Speaker 14:  tried to kind of force the console stuff onto pc, but PC games don't really

796
00:50:06,405 --> 00:50:10,125
Speaker 14:  want that. They use Discord and Steam and they don't really care about

797
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:13,445
Speaker 14:  an exports party chat or whatever. Like that's not a thing. Right. And it's

798
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:17,365
Speaker 14:  just, I think that is reflected internally. Like there's like

799
00:50:17,365 --> 00:50:21,325
Speaker 14:  the old days, what was that org chart where like Microsoft's business units

800
00:50:21,325 --> 00:50:23,965
Speaker 14:  were pointing guns at each other. Like I think that's still, that's right.

801
00:50:23,995 --> 00:50:27,765
Speaker 14:  That still kind of exists a little bit and there's still fiefdoms and stuff.

802
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:31,285
Speaker 14:  you know, like I do think that exports hasn't been able to do exactly what

803
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:34,085
Speaker 14:  it wants on Windows because the Microsoft stores there,

804
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:38,645
Speaker 14:  you know, there's a control of Windows. That's a way from exports. So if

805
00:50:38,645 --> 00:50:41,725
Speaker 14:  they can break down those barriers somehow, like they're gonna have to,

806
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:45,565
Speaker 14:  if they want their gaming business to, to, to survive on Windows at least

807
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:49,365
Speaker 14:  anyway. 'cause Valve is doing some impressive stuff. And

808
00:50:49,845 --> 00:50:52,925
Speaker 14:  I don't know, that's the, that's the biggest f threat I think to, to Microsoft's

809
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,645
Speaker 14:  gaming stuff rather than Sony

810
00:50:54,915 --> 00:50:58,325
Speaker 2:  When Microsoft talks about its competitors, Phil Spencer and others, they

811
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:01,845
Speaker 2:  talk a lot about PlayStation and Nintendo. Yeah. But they don't talk a lot

812
00:51:01,845 --> 00:51:05,485
Speaker 2:  about Valve. Like how much do you think Valve weighs on

813
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:08,005
Speaker 2:  Phil Spencer's mind as he considers The future of Xbox?

814
00:51:08,685 --> 00:51:12,565
Speaker 14:  I think more so these days, although he probably wouldn't admit it, but

815
00:51:12,645 --> 00:51:16,285
Speaker 14:  I, I I think you can just see like, obviously Steam Beck isn't doing huge

816
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:20,085
Speaker 14:  numbers right now, but it's starting that category of devices, but

817
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:20,885
Speaker 2:  It's like Beloved.

818
00:51:21,235 --> 00:51:22,245
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And it's beloved

819
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:26,245
Speaker 2:  Gamer like Capital G gamers, like love that thing. And I think, I feel like

820
00:51:26,245 --> 00:51:29,485
Speaker 2:  if I'm Phil Spencer, the thing I've learned over the last decade is I have

821
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,005
Speaker 2:  to keep the capital G gamers happy.

822
00:51:31,665 --> 00:51:35,525
Speaker 14:  Yes, exactly. Yeah. Like it is becoming, it's something that's had

823
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,405
Speaker 14:  promise for like 10 years and now it's like an actual reality. Like people

824
00:51:38,405 --> 00:51:42,205
Speaker 14:  are actually playing these things. They're not just some random OEM

825
00:51:42,355 --> 00:51:45,885
Speaker 14:  from somewhere. Like that's creating them. This has got the full backing

826
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:49,005
Speaker 14:  and, and Proton on Linux. That's the main, that's the key, right? It's getting

827
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:52,565
Speaker 14:  those games, like not emulated, but you know, like translated

828
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:56,765
Speaker 14:  onto Linux. So yeah, I I feel like if they can tie it all over

829
00:51:57,005 --> 00:52:00,205
Speaker 14:  together internally at Microsoft, then they could pull something off like

830
00:52:00,205 --> 00:52:04,125
Speaker 14:  the windows underneath and the exports on top. But there's licensing stuff.

831
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:07,605
Speaker 14:  Like they publish a say when they bring their game to exports. It's on a

832
00:52:07,605 --> 00:52:08,885
Speaker 14:  console Right. Not on a pc.

833
00:52:09,405 --> 00:52:09,685
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Yeah.

834
00:52:09,705 --> 00:52:12,125
Speaker 14:  So there's a lot of stuff to like work through if they're ever gonna do

835
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:16,045
Speaker 14:  that. I dunno whether it ever realistically happen, but that would, I, I

836
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:19,805
Speaker 14:  still maintain that if they did pull it off somehow it would be

837
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:20,885
Speaker 14:  a killer device.

838
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:25,245
Speaker 2:  It does feel like this is a year where if everything goes

839
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:29,165
Speaker 2:  right, Microsoft's vision for this could come sort of to

840
00:52:29,165 --> 00:52:32,165
Speaker 2:  fruition in really interesting new powerful ways. Right? Yeah. It has

841
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:36,485
Speaker 2:  Activision Blizzards, so it has this big new, I mean title in Call

842
00:52:36,485 --> 00:52:39,805
Speaker 2:  of Duty, but also this big new pipe into mobile in a way that Phil Spencer

843
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,725
Speaker 2:  has been telling you for years is really important. With all the changes

844
00:52:42,725 --> 00:52:46,685
Speaker 2:  coming to the app stores, Microsoft might have an in to be able to

845
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:50,165
Speaker 2:  do more stuff. The handheld thing could start to happen. Like it just feels

846
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:54,005
Speaker 2:  like if, if Microsoft's vision of kind of Xbox everywhere and being

847
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:57,245
Speaker 2:  this platform across all different screens

848
00:52:57,835 --> 00:53:00,685
Speaker 2:  like it, it does seem like a lot of things would have to go right. But you

849
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:03,645
Speaker 2:  can sort of see how the pieces would start to fit together. Right.

850
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:07,325
Speaker 14:  Yeah, no you can And and, and you mentioned mobile and I think that's like,

851
00:53:07,555 --> 00:53:09,885
Speaker 14:  that is a key one for them 'cause they're obviously gonna be publishing

852
00:53:09,885 --> 00:53:13,765
Speaker 14:  a bunch of like Call of Duty mobiles. It's, it's huge. So we've tion B of

853
00:53:13,765 --> 00:53:17,125
Speaker 14:  activation is a king Candy Crush. The all the rest, they get really big

854
00:53:17,215 --> 00:53:20,605
Speaker 14:  entry point into mobile and they've obviously were trying to leverage that

855
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:24,725
Speaker 14:  to build a store on iOS and Android. But then obviously the Apple changes

856
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:28,765
Speaker 14:  and, and, and Phil mentioned, I I specifically pushed him on the, the Apple

857
00:53:28,765 --> 00:53:32,365
Speaker 14:  changes for exports cloud gaming. 'cause I think that's, that's kind of

858
00:53:32,365 --> 00:53:35,885
Speaker 14:  a precursor I I'd say to the, the mobile store because they've been trying

859
00:53:35,885 --> 00:53:39,445
Speaker 14:  to get that app on there for, for years now and they've had to do a progressive

860
00:53:39,445 --> 00:53:42,885
Speaker 14:  web app instead. And it's interesting that he said we can't

861
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:46,885
Speaker 14:  monetize exports cloud gaming even if they were to do an app.

862
00:53:47,065 --> 00:53:50,725
Speaker 14:  So obviously whatever Apple's changes are under the hood, they're not good

863
00:53:50,725 --> 00:53:54,205
Speaker 14:  enough for Microsoft. And it's also interesting that those changes and what

864
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:57,965
Speaker 14:  Apple's doing in iOS 17.4 by removing the PW

865
00:53:57,995 --> 00:54:01,845
Speaker 14:  apps means that exports cloud gaming is basically just gonna, it's gonna

866
00:54:01,845 --> 00:54:05,725
Speaker 14:  be a link now. It's not even gonna feel like a slightly native app. So

867
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:09,445
Speaker 14:  that puts him back a, a step back as well in the EU markets at least

868
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:09,805
Speaker 14:  anyway.

869
00:54:09,995 --> 00:54:13,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Apple's ability to claim it has opened up the app store

870
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:18,165
Speaker 2:  while seeming to not satisfy anyone who wants a more

871
00:54:18,165 --> 00:54:21,805
Speaker 2:  open app store has been very impressive. Is he still

872
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:25,765
Speaker 2:  thinking about mobile as kind of the center of what's next

873
00:54:25,825 --> 00:54:27,965
Speaker 2:  in the gaming ecosystem in the same way?

874
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:32,285
Speaker 14:  I feel like a few things have shifted, right? Because for mobile for Microsoft

875
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:35,085
Speaker 14:  that when they were thinking about it, it was more cloud right before a

876
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:38,725
Speaker 14:  BK ably King. But now the

877
00:54:39,015 --> 00:54:43,005
Speaker 14:  cloud has slowed down and people aren't really as interested in it and

878
00:54:43,235 --> 00:54:46,725
Speaker 14:  handhelds are emerging, right. As, as the kind of mobile now almost.

879
00:54:47,165 --> 00:54:49,965
Speaker 14:  I feel like that's, that's shifted things a little bit. It's definitely

880
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:53,925
Speaker 14:  shifted our thinking. Like we thought that cloud would, you know, grow like

881
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:58,085
Speaker 14:  Microsoft did. And I think targeting mobile native games in iOS and Android

882
00:54:58,145 --> 00:55:01,085
Speaker 14:  is, is still a ways off. Like they have, they have these big ones but they

883
00:55:01,085 --> 00:55:04,925
Speaker 14:  still need to build a, a bunch of different games there. So I

884
00:55:04,925 --> 00:55:08,165
Speaker 14:  don't know that it's necessarily changed. I think it's just definitely pushing

885
00:55:08,195 --> 00:55:11,805
Speaker 14:  more towards the handhelds than, than Cloud to get to, to that sort of mobile

886
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:14,485
Speaker 14:  state or this idea of exports everywhere, you know.

887
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:17,845
Speaker 2:  Well and to that point, actually, one of the things you asked Phil that I

888
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:20,845
Speaker 2:  thought was a very funny way of asking the question was basically would you

889
00:55:20,845 --> 00:55:24,805
Speaker 2:  rather continue to pursue the next Minecraft or the next PAL world or

890
00:55:24,805 --> 00:55:28,765
Speaker 2:  the next version of these individual games? Not

891
00:55:28,765 --> 00:55:32,085
Speaker 2:  gaming platforms but games that are sort of universes and platforms unto

892
00:55:32,085 --> 00:55:35,965
Speaker 2:  themselves rather than trying to get more game past subscribers. And he said

893
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:38,925
Speaker 2:  he, he gave you a really wishy-washy answer, which is basically like, we'd

894
00:55:38,925 --> 00:55:42,605
Speaker 2:  like both, which like of course, but it does seem like we

895
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:46,365
Speaker 2:  might be entering a phase where rather than I have access to,

896
00:55:46,705 --> 00:55:50,645
Speaker 2:  you know, these 10 AAA games all in one place, we're kind of entering a place

897
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:54,525
Speaker 2:  where the AA game is the platform. Like that's

898
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:58,285
Speaker 2:  what Fortnite is becoming. That's Minecraft. Is that Roblox is that

899
00:55:58,415 --> 00:56:02,365
Speaker 2:  maybe that's the next turn rather than I have a bunch of sort

900
00:56:02,365 --> 00:56:05,845
Speaker 2:  of disparate games all available in the same app and Microsoft is gonna like,

901
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:08,005
Speaker 2:  all you have to do is look at the money and that's what it would tell you

902
00:56:08,005 --> 00:56:08,805
Speaker 2:  to chase right now. Right.

903
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:12,965
Speaker 14:  I no, I agree. And I, I kind of posed a question to him is like, that's

904
00:56:12,965 --> 00:56:16,685
Speaker 14:  my thinking that they'd rather have a, another Minecraft light or a Fortnight,

905
00:56:16,685 --> 00:56:20,645
Speaker 14:  you know, like these are essentially social platforms that,

906
00:56:20,645 --> 00:56:24,525
Speaker 14:  that teenagers hang out in. Right. Just to, to to chill with their friends.

907
00:56:25,305 --> 00:56:28,925
Speaker 14:  So who wouldn't want that? And the, the amount of in-game revenue like that,

908
00:56:28,925 --> 00:56:32,525
Speaker 14:  that's like a big chunk of the exports content and

909
00:56:33,205 --> 00:56:35,885
Speaker 14:  services revenue, right, is for from, from all these in-game purchases.

910
00:56:35,905 --> 00:56:39,165
Speaker 14:  So, so I'm sure they would love a massive hit like that and Powell World

911
00:56:39,165 --> 00:56:43,045
Speaker 14:  was obviously a big one for them, having that just not

912
00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:46,805
Speaker 14:  exclusive to exports, it's just the fact that Sony doesn't allow those early

913
00:56:46,825 --> 00:56:50,245
Speaker 14:  access games on their platform. But having that available in exports is,

914
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:54,205
Speaker 14:  I feel like that's probably been pretty enlightening as well. So yeah, like

915
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:57,125
Speaker 14:  I feel like they, they would still prefer to have one of those big games

916
00:56:57,125 --> 00:57:01,005
Speaker 14:  than, you know, another million game pass subscribers

917
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:03,725
Speaker 14:  or whatever. 'cause they, they'll probably get the games of pass subscribers

918
00:57:03,725 --> 00:57:04,765
Speaker 14:  on the back of that anyway.

919
00:57:05,095 --> 00:57:08,765
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah, I mean, and I think what does seem to be true is that making

920
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:12,645
Speaker 2:  one of those that is a big hit is a lot harder and a lot more finicky than

921
00:57:12,645 --> 00:57:16,445
Speaker 2:  it gets credit for. So he's probably right to kind of hedge his bets a little

922
00:57:16,445 --> 00:57:19,965
Speaker 2:  bit there. but it certainly seems to be true that If, you can get

923
00:57:20,305 --> 00:57:24,285
Speaker 2:  one of those handful of spaces online where people actually wanna be and

924
00:57:24,285 --> 00:57:27,605
Speaker 2:  hang out and spend time. I mean you've, you've caught lightning in a bottle

925
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,605
Speaker 2:  and you should chase that kind of to the ends of the earth.

926
00:57:29,955 --> 00:57:32,645
Speaker 14:  Yeah, it's, I think it's the thing that they're tracking internally as well.

927
00:57:32,645 --> 00:57:35,765
Speaker 14:  It's like, it's the engagement right there that everyone tracks these days

928
00:57:35,765 --> 00:57:39,085
Speaker 14:  as well. The time spent in a game, the time spent on the console rather

929
00:57:39,085 --> 00:57:42,525
Speaker 14:  than we've sold X amount of consoles, which is,

930
00:57:42,865 --> 00:57:46,605
Speaker 14:  is great, but it, that's a funnel win to your software and If, you don't

931
00:57:46,605 --> 00:57:49,565
Speaker 14:  have the games to keep people sticky in, in there and they're going elsewhere

932
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:52,565
Speaker 14:  for, you know, whether it be Netflix or whatever for their entertainment

933
00:57:52,565 --> 00:57:56,445
Speaker 14:  needs. It's keeping that sticky experience to, to keep people spending

934
00:57:56,585 --> 00:57:59,565
Speaker 14:  and keep people playing and all that sort of stuff. So that's definitely

935
00:57:59,565 --> 00:58:01,085
Speaker 14:  the, the way that they're looking at internally

936
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:04,525
Speaker 2:  Makes sense. So, okay, last thing and then I'm gonna let you go. The four

937
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:08,485
Speaker 2:  games that are coming from Xbox to other platforms, Microsoft has not announced,

938
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,685
Speaker 2:  but you know, because you're, you're, you're better at this than everybody

939
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:15,605
Speaker 2:  at Microsoft, sorry, everybody at Microsoft. What do you make of the

940
00:58:15,605 --> 00:58:19,285
Speaker 2:  four games that Microsoft picked to do this with and then also

941
00:58:19,505 --> 00:58:23,285
Speaker 2:  you asked Phil about Starfield and Indiana Jones kind of these bigger name

942
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:26,525
Speaker 2:  games, the sort of central franchises. Do you think we're gonna see those

943
00:58:26,785 --> 00:58:29,965
Speaker 2:  at some point here in The future go down the same road? Yeah,

944
00:58:29,985 --> 00:58:33,845
Speaker 14:  So like the, the four games are kind of interesting 'cause CF P's obviously

945
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:37,725
Speaker 14:  like it's a pirate game, which would be kind of funny to watch Exports

946
00:58:37,785 --> 00:58:41,525
Speaker 14:  fanboy and PlayStation fanboy battling out in the sea, right.

947
00:58:41,645 --> 00:58:44,885
Speaker 14:  Thinking each other and it's actually kind of perfect, virtually murdering

948
00:58:44,885 --> 00:58:48,765
Speaker 14:  each other. So that, that's gonna be quite funny to witness. And I

949
00:58:48,765 --> 00:58:52,165
Speaker 14:  think that one makes sense, right? It's a multiplayer game, live service

950
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:55,765
Speaker 14:  game. You do want those games across as many platforms as possible because

951
00:58:55,795 --> 00:58:59,765
Speaker 14:  when, when the numbers dwindle then it doesn't make for such a

952
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:03,405
Speaker 14:  good game less people playing it. So that one makes sense. Similar sort

953
00:59:03,405 --> 00:59:06,925
Speaker 14:  of thing for grounded as well, similar sort of multiplayer sort of experience

954
00:59:06,925 --> 00:59:10,485
Speaker 14:  there and stuff. And then you've got like HiFi Rush, which I think is

955
00:59:10,925 --> 00:59:14,445
Speaker 14:  probably one of the ones where it's like less obvious why it should go on

956
00:59:14,445 --> 00:59:17,485
Speaker 14:  other platforms. But I think the way they kind of launched it, it was like

957
00:59:17,525 --> 00:59:21,445
Speaker 14:  a shadow drop after an exports I think like developer direct that they had

958
00:59:21,785 --> 00:59:25,285
Speaker 14:  and it didn't really have much fanfare, but it's like a great game. So like

959
00:59:25,285 --> 00:59:28,325
Speaker 14:  one of the, I think Phil described it as like a hidden gem, which is true.

960
00:59:28,345 --> 00:59:31,685
Speaker 14:  And then they want more people to experience that and it could, I guess

961
00:59:32,065 --> 00:59:35,325
Speaker 14:  get people to think differently about exports games or exports as the platform,

962
00:59:35,355 --> 00:59:38,565
Speaker 14:  like that sort of thing. Same, same kind of same thing with Penman as well.

963
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:42,445
Speaker 14:  They need to do one about app is that we should have known, knew it was

964
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:46,365
Speaker 14:  gonna go on Switch or PlayStation all the time because in Mike's

965
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:49,085
Speaker 14:  blog posts, when they first announced it, at the bottom of it they said

966
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:52,845
Speaker 14:  exports console launch exclusive. So AKA

967
00:59:53,305 --> 00:59:56,965
Speaker 14:  is gonna go elsewhere. Like they, they had it there plain as day all along.

968
00:59:57,225 --> 01:00:00,405
Speaker 14:  But yeah, like beyond that, these are the four that they're talking about

969
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:03,365
Speaker 14:  initially. But beyond that there are bigger questions around

970
01:00:04,395 --> 01:00:08,325
Speaker 14:  Starfield. Obviously Indiana, Jones, other games, there's a

971
01:00:08,325 --> 01:00:11,365
Speaker 14:  bit of a backlash as well with the exports fans at the moment about Starfield

972
01:00:11,465 --> 01:00:15,045
Speaker 14:  and some of the reporting around it and Indiana, Jones, So, I just wanna

973
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:18,925
Speaker 14:  be super clear that Microsoft is considering both of those. It was

974
01:00:19,205 --> 01:00:22,805
Speaker 14:  considering, it still is, considering it's not off the menu, it's not on

975
01:00:22,805 --> 01:00:26,285
Speaker 14:  the menu, it's not been finally decided or anything like that. So those

976
01:00:26,285 --> 01:00:29,325
Speaker 14:  still could come, but they might not, we don't know yet. It's not a finalized

977
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:32,845
Speaker 14:  decision like these four tiles are, but I think the, the important thing

978
01:00:32,865 --> 01:00:36,805
Speaker 14:  is the fact that they were even considering it shows you what

979
01:00:36,805 --> 01:00:40,765
Speaker 14:  their ambition is here, right? The talk of exports, every

980
01:00:40,765 --> 01:00:43,125
Speaker 14:  screen's an exports, exports everywhere, all that sort of stuff. If, you

981
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:46,085
Speaker 14:  if If you add it all together, you can, you know, and you look at their

982
01:00:46,345 --> 01:00:50,125
Speaker 14:  finely crafted messaging during that podcast, If, you read between the lines

983
01:00:50,145 --> 01:00:53,325
Speaker 14:  and you look at very no bias or anything like that, you could pretty much

984
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:57,125
Speaker 14:  see what their strategy is, right? They, let's go slowly, surely

985
01:00:57,735 --> 01:01:01,565
Speaker 14:  maybe some learnings, maybe we'll launch day and date, certain game

986
01:01:01,565 --> 01:01:04,685
Speaker 14:  in The, future unannounced games, all that sort of stuff. Like they, they,

987
01:01:04,685 --> 01:01:07,765
Speaker 14:  they're toying with all these sort of ideas. Nothing is final, but I think

988
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:10,445
Speaker 14:  it's, it does come down to the fact that they're, they're even thinking

989
01:01:10,445 --> 01:01:13,085
Speaker 14:  about that stuff. That's the interesting part for me. I think that was the

990
01:01:13,085 --> 01:01:15,445
Speaker 14:  bit when I heard that they were like thinking about some of these things

991
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,165
Speaker 14:  then, you know, it's a bigger strategy shift than the way they kind of

992
01:01:19,345 --> 01:01:20,605
Speaker 14:  teased it out on Thursday.

993
01:01:20,915 --> 01:01:24,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And you get the sense that Microsoft is trying to do a huge

994
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:28,245
Speaker 2:  thing without anyone realizing how huge a thing it is, which

995
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:32,725
Speaker 2:  Microsoft has learned the hard way. When it makes giant noises about how

996
01:01:32,725 --> 01:01:36,645
Speaker 2:  it's gonna change every industry forever, it goes badly. So this time they're,

997
01:01:36,645 --> 01:01:40,005
Speaker 2:  it seems like they're trying to make just as big a change, but like

998
01:01:40,545 --> 01:01:42,205
Speaker 2:  so quietly that nobody notices.

999
01:01:42,555 --> 01:01:45,645
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And then it gives them the the room to adjust as they go, right? Like

1000
01:01:45,645 --> 01:01:49,445
Speaker 14:  they, they, they could have some plans for certain games to come in

1001
01:01:49,445 --> 01:01:53,085
Speaker 14:  like the next six months. And the problem everyone also has to think about

1002
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:56,125
Speaker 14:  is that this is gonna cost them money to port this, to, to do the work and,

1003
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:58,925
Speaker 14:  and it's not something they just go, okay, we're gonna, we're gonna put

1004
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:02,645
Speaker 14:  this game in here and then, you know, Monday they publish it. This, this

1005
01:02:02,645 --> 01:02:05,965
Speaker 14:  is planned months in advance. This is like a, a big project internally.

1006
01:02:06,105 --> 01:02:08,805
Speaker 14:  So it's not, it's not something they've just thought, oh we're gonna do

1007
01:02:08,805 --> 01:02:12,125
Speaker 14:  these four games. But yeah, it does, it does give them that freedom to sort

1008
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:16,045
Speaker 14:  of tweak things as they go. Look at what the fans reception, look at the

1009
01:02:16,045 --> 01:02:19,085
Speaker 14:  sales numbers, all this sort of stuff. They'll have people pouring over

1010
01:02:19,545 --> 01:02:23,245
Speaker 14:  all this data with MATLAB for hours and hours I'm sure. But yeah,

1011
01:02:23,275 --> 01:02:27,125
Speaker 14:  like I think it still speaks to that there's something bigger going on

1012
01:02:27,185 --> 01:02:27,605
Speaker 14:  for sure.

1013
01:02:27,905 --> 01:02:30,045
Speaker 2:  All right, well I suspect it's gonna be a big year so we're gonna have to

1014
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:33,525
Speaker 2:  check in a few times, but Tom, thank you as always. Appreciate it. Thanks

1015
01:02:33,525 --> 01:02:33,725
Speaker 14:  Simon.

1016
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:37,725
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna get to the Birch

1021
01:04:27,755 --> 01:04:31,385

1022
01:04:31,385 --> 01:04:34,705
Speaker 2:  being honest, I'm excited about the idea of talking about something other

1023
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:38,385
Speaker 2:  than the Vision Pro. So If, you have questions about anything on Earth other

1024

Speaker 2:  than the Vision Pro, please send them in 8 6 6 Verge one one

1025
01:04:42,305 --> 01:04:45,905
Speaker 2:  Vergecast to The Verge dot com. This week we have a question about passwords.

1026
01:04:47,165 --> 01:04:51,065
Speaker 17:  Hey Vergecast, my question is kind of simple. Do you think the recent slate

1027
01:04:51,165 --> 01:04:54,945
Speaker 17:  of crackdowns on Netflix, Hulu, et cetera, on

1028
01:04:55,265 --> 01:04:58,745
Speaker 17:  password sharing will achieve their goal of getting more paid

1029
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:02,385
Speaker 17:  subscribers? Will people just throw their hands up and say it was fun while

1030
01:05:02,385 --> 01:05:05,985
Speaker 17:  it lasted? you know, like many families, friend groups and the like,

1031
01:05:06,205 --> 01:05:09,985
Speaker 17:  you know, mom and dad pay for Netflix and Max, I pay for

1032
01:05:10,175 --> 01:05:13,465
Speaker 17:  Hulu, Disney Plus and Amazon and we've had our little happy

1033
01:05:13,935 --> 01:05:17,845
Speaker 17:  Netflix Amazon sharing ecosystem. Now

1034
01:05:17,845 --> 01:05:21,725
Speaker 17:  that I can't access the Netflix account, I kind of refuse to get my own

1035
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:25,445
Speaker 17:  partially out of spite and partially out of my budget,

1036
01:05:25,595 --> 01:05:29,565
Speaker 17:  genuinely not allowed for it. So I'm wondering, do you

1037
01:05:29,565 --> 01:05:33,445
Speaker 17:  think there'll be more people like me who say you know it and just

1038
01:05:33,445 --> 01:05:37,245
Speaker 17:  do without, or more people who will suck it up and you know, get their own

1039
01:05:37,525 --> 01:05:40,445
Speaker 17:  subscription. Who do you think is gonna blink first us as the services?

1040
01:05:40,945 --> 01:05:43,925
Speaker 17:  Thanks, hope to hear you guys answer this question on the show. Appreciate

1041
01:05:43,925 --> 01:05:44,365
Speaker 17:  what you do.

1042
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:47,765
Speaker 2:  Of course we have a question about passwords and we have a question about

1043
01:05:47,765 --> 01:05:50,965
Speaker 2:  streaming. Who else? But Alex. Cranz. Alex. Welcome.

1044
01:05:51,665 --> 01:05:51,885
Speaker 18:  Hey.

1045
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:56,405
Speaker 2:  Okay, so first of all, I wanna know, does your family have a, who pays for

1046
01:05:56,405 --> 01:05:59,765
Speaker 2:  what streaming arrangement? Because my family a hundred percent does and

1047
01:05:59,945 --> 01:06:01,245
Speaker 2:  I'm glad to know that others do too.

1048
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:05,445
Speaker 18:  Yes. But it's really just, I pay for everything and then my mom, when she

1049
01:06:05,445 --> 01:06:07,725
Speaker 18:  wants to watch things or my sister, they like text me and they're like,

1050
01:06:07,725 --> 01:06:08,485
Speaker 18:  can I have your password?

1051
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:10,925
Speaker 2:  So it's just everyone mooches off of you.

1052
01:06:11,355 --> 01:06:15,205
Speaker 18:  Yeah, they're just all mooches. But I guess it's like reciprocal. I mooched

1053
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:17,645
Speaker 18:  off my mom for, you know, 18 years. So

1054
01:06:18,385 --> 01:06:21,085
Speaker 2:  That's fair. This is your way of paying them back. That's beautiful. Yeah.

1055
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:25,285
Speaker 2:  So what do you think, I realize I have a pretty strong opinion here that

1056
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:27,845
Speaker 2:  I can't base on anything, but I'm curious what you think. Well,

1057
01:06:27,945 --> 01:06:31,765
Speaker 18:  The data suggests that consumers blink

1058
01:06:31,775 --> 01:06:35,685
Speaker 18:  first. That we blink before the companies do, right? Like Netflix has

1059
01:06:35,685 --> 01:06:38,965
Speaker 18:  been successful with their password sharing crackdown so far, which is like

1060
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:42,965
Speaker 18:  a major bummer because I really want them to blink first. But now

1061
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:46,725
Speaker 18:  that Hulu's doing it, now that Disney Plus is doing it, we're we're getting

1062
01:06:46,755 --> 01:06:50,725
Speaker 18:  more more people in on it. At some point that's gonna stop, right?

1063
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:54,085
Speaker 18:  At some point people really are gonna stop saying, no, I just don't need

1064
01:06:54,085 --> 01:06:57,965
Speaker 18:  this product. And Netflix has been like really successful because it's

1065
01:06:57,965 --> 01:07:01,805
Speaker 18:  Netflix, right? Hulu might not be as successful. even that

1066
01:07:02,005 --> 01:07:04,645
Speaker 18:  everyone should go watch Fargo. It's great. you know, a lot of people will

1067
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:08,445
Speaker 18:  be like, I don't need to watch Fargo or whatever new FX show is

1068
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:12,165
Speaker 18:  on, I'll need to watch Bluey. That's that's the Disney plus

1069
01:07:12,265 --> 01:07:16,005
Speaker 18:  one, right? Yeah. Like that may happen, in which case, yeah,

1070
01:07:16,155 --> 01:07:20,005
Speaker 18:  suck it streamers stop trying to like crack down on all of us. Just

1071
01:07:20,005 --> 01:07:21,325
Speaker 18:  let us do what we want. Yeah,

1072
01:07:21,465 --> 01:07:25,405
Speaker 2:  That's basically where I land too. I think. It seems to me that it's clearly

1073
01:07:25,405 --> 01:07:28,765
Speaker 2:  going to work from a technological perspective. Like I, I think when the,

1074
01:07:28,765 --> 01:07:31,165
Speaker 2:  when Netflix started doing this, everybody's like, oh this will be easy to

1075
01:07:31,165 --> 01:07:35,085
Speaker 2:  get around. Like spoiler alert, super not easy to get around. They have more

1076
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:38,645
Speaker 2:  or less done the thing they set out to do. And from that

1077
01:07:38,645 --> 01:07:42,365
Speaker 2:  perspective, it's clearly gonna work and anyone who wants to

1078
01:07:42,365 --> 01:07:44,645
Speaker 2:  lock people out is going to lock people out. They're getting very good at

1079
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:47,445
Speaker 2:  this, it's very sophisticated, it's just gonna work. I do think that if you're

1080
01:07:47,445 --> 01:07:51,325
Speaker 2:  a streaming service, the very last thing you want to do is give people

1081
01:07:51,605 --> 01:07:55,445
Speaker 2:  a reason to say, do I actually watch anything on here? Yeah. And

1082
01:07:55,445 --> 01:07:58,445
Speaker 2:  like to your point, right, there are streaming services that I pay for. Like

1083
01:07:58,445 --> 01:08:01,045
Speaker 2:  for me, weirdly enough, it's actually Disney Plus I don't use Disney plus

1084
01:08:01,045 --> 01:08:04,165
Speaker 2:  that often. I don't really know why. Like I like all the stuff that's on

1085
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:07,685
Speaker 2:  there. It's just not, when I sit down to watch something, it's probably the

1086
01:08:07,705 --> 01:08:11,405
Speaker 2:  fourth app I open. And so for me, the minute

1087
01:08:11,665 --> 01:08:15,400
Speaker 2:  it becomes sort of in my face whether I want to keep paying for Disney

1088
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,205
Speaker 2:  plus, I'm probably gonna say no. And I think what's about to happen to a

1089
01:08:19,205 --> 01:08:22,245
Speaker 2:  lot of people is it is going to be put in their face. Do you still want to

1090
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:25,445
Speaker 2:  pay for this? And I think you're right that the answer for most people for

1091
01:08:25,445 --> 01:08:28,965
Speaker 2:  Netflix is yes, right? Like I, I watch an alarming amount of Netflix.

1092
01:08:29,275 --> 01:08:32,605
Speaker 2:  Most of it is not stuff I couldn't live without. There are very few things

1093
01:08:32,605 --> 01:08:36,085
Speaker 2:  on Netflix that feel like core to my personality and life,

1094
01:08:36,665 --> 01:08:39,445
Speaker 2:  but it's just where I go to watch stuff. And that's pretty powerful. And

1095
01:08:39,445 --> 01:08:42,965
Speaker 2:  also only Netflix gets to be that thing. And so for me, I feel like

1096
01:08:43,145 --> 01:08:46,285
Speaker 2:  Disney Plus can probably get away with it just because it has some of that

1097
01:08:46,285 --> 01:08:50,165
Speaker 2:  same like core content to some people. But like Hulu is

1098
01:08:50,245 --> 01:08:52,765
Speaker 2:  actually probably a good example. Like how much stuff is there on Hulu that

1099
01:08:52,765 --> 01:08:55,885
Speaker 2:  if Hulu suddenly went away from your life, you would be like devastated without,

1100
01:08:56,325 --> 01:08:57,445
Speaker 18:  I really liked Fargo

1101
01:08:57,895 --> 01:08:59,605
Speaker 2:  Fargo is really good. I'll give you that

1102
01:08:59,915 --> 01:09:03,645
Speaker 18:  Look, the new season was excellent, but it it, I I agree. Yeah. Like

1103
01:09:03,955 --> 01:09:07,845
Speaker 18:  Hulu is is one I probably I i I might churn on, right? I might, I

1104
01:09:07,845 --> 01:09:10,805
Speaker 18:  might subscribe when I need it and, and unsubscribe when I don't.

1105
01:09:11,035 --> 01:09:14,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. My, my big Galaxy brain take is that it is both

1106
01:09:14,895 --> 01:09:18,805
Speaker 2:  going to work and it is also going to like speed

1107
01:09:18,805 --> 01:09:22,725
Speaker 2:  up this crazy consolidation that is happening in this industry right

1108
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:26,605
Speaker 2:  now where having the account is going to be the way that you

1109
01:09:26,665 --> 01:09:30,405
Speaker 2:  win, right? Like having a login that I have, which for lots of people,

1110
01:09:30,405 --> 01:09:33,525
Speaker 2:  they're not going to have a login anymore and they're gonna have to make

1111
01:09:33,605 --> 01:09:37,405
Speaker 2:  a new one. And making people make a new login is hard and you lose a lot

1112
01:09:37,405 --> 01:09:41,205
Speaker 2:  of people when you make people do it. And So I think it's gonna take all

1113
01:09:41,205 --> 01:09:45,165
Speaker 2:  of these like not quite Netflix streaming services and it's gonna

1114
01:09:45,165 --> 01:09:48,605
Speaker 2:  make their lives much harder in service of

1115
01:09:48,985 --> 01:09:52,085
Speaker 2:  trying to get more people. So I think it's, it's gonna consolidate.

1116
01:09:52,265 --> 01:09:54,725
Speaker 18:  That's why they're doing that thing where they're, where they're bundling,

1117
01:09:54,725 --> 01:09:58,085
Speaker 18:  right? Like true. That's why Paramount Plus you can get that now through

1118
01:09:58,305 --> 01:10:01,725
Speaker 18:  Amazon. 'cause they acknowledge that most people only want that for either

1119
01:10:01,725 --> 01:10:05,085
Speaker 18:  their Taylor Sheridan or their Star Trek fix or to watch the Super Bowl

1120
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:08,925
Speaker 18:  poorly. Like so So I think they, they, they kind

1121
01:10:08,925 --> 01:10:11,885
Speaker 18:  of recognize what's gonna happen and a lot of them have made peace with

1122
01:10:11,885 --> 01:10:15,285
Speaker 18:  it and, and Netflix can get away with it. Netflix has shown it works for

1123
01:10:15,285 --> 01:10:19,205
Speaker 18:  Netflix, so Netflix is gonna keep doing it and it'll be fine

1124
01:10:19,205 --> 01:10:22,725
Speaker 18:  until one day you say, ah, do I need to watch that many K dramas? Maybe

1125
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:25,245
Speaker 18:  I can watch something else on another channel and be done.

1126
01:10:25,415 --> 01:10:28,845
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah. We're definitely in a phase where Netflix kind of continues

1127
01:10:28,845 --> 01:10:31,925
Speaker 2:  to flex on everybody and everybody is trying to do a Netflix impression and

1128
01:10:31,945 --> 01:10:35,005
Speaker 2:  it seems less and less likely that it's gonna work for a lot of these companies.

1129
01:10:35,275 --> 01:10:35,565
Speaker 18:  Yeah.

1130
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:39,125
Speaker 2:  All right, well we'll see. In the meantime, we still should have been angrier

1131
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:41,725
Speaker 2:  about this the whole time and I am angry about it now and we will continue

1132
01:10:41,725 --> 01:10:42,645
Speaker 2:  to be angry about it.

1133
01:10:42,965 --> 01:10:46,845
Speaker 18:  Just find a great website where you can download a file and

1134
01:10:46,845 --> 01:10:50,765
Speaker 18:  then you put that on a software program and it, it, it stuff

1135
01:10:50,765 --> 01:10:53,605
Speaker 18:  happens. I don't wanna get too into it, but you, you can work around it
