Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast. The flagship podcast of measuring changes in

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,080
Speaker 2:  gravitational force. I'm your friend, David Pierce. And I am recording this

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,960
Speaker 2:  into the apple watch series eight that I bought myself on Sunday. That doesn't

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,480
Speaker 2:  sound like particularly exciting news, but it does mean I've started leaving

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,080
Speaker 2:  my phone at home, connecting my headphones to my watch, downloading a bunch

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,790
Speaker 2:  of podcasts and then going on screen free adventures everywhere.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,240
Speaker 2:  It's great. I'm not gonna lie to you. And I actually think this mic sounds

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,760
Speaker 2:  pretty good. I'm sort of impressed. Anyway, today on the show, we have a

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,360
Speaker 2:  bunch of big things to talk about. We're gonna dig into the huge grand theft

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,880
Speaker 2:  auto six leak from over the weekend and what we know about both the

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,800
Speaker 2:  game and what happens to it now as a result of the leak, we're

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,280
Speaker 2:  also gonna see if there's anything to this whole idea, that TikTok is the

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,140
Speaker 2:  search engine of the future and is gonna replace Google for young people.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,480
Speaker 2:  And we're gonna answer some of your Vergecast hotline questions about the

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,320
Speaker 2:  new iPhones and new apple watches, big show, all that is coming in just a

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,760
Speaker 2:  second. But first I actually have to charge this apple watch because it has

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,320
Speaker 2:  a lot of good things going for it, but the battery still kind of sucks. This

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,560
Speaker 2:  is the verge cast. See in a

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,820
Speaker 2:  sec,

21
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,540
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So over the weekend, somebody who goes by the screen

22
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,500
Speaker 2:  named teapot, Uber hacker posted a three gigabyte file

23
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,340
Speaker 2:  with 90 videos to a grand theft auto forum that they

24
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,820
Speaker 2:  claimed show to footage from grand theft auto six, a game that has been

25
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,740
Speaker 2:  rumored and talked about for a while, but is reportedly at least two

26
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,580
Speaker 2:  years away from coming out. But it's grand theft auto. It's a huge deal.

27
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,180
Speaker 2:  It's one of the most popular games on the planet. So

28
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,840
Speaker 2:  with all of this stuff out there now, what do we know about the game

29
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,580
Speaker 2:  and what happens now? That so much has leaked. That's what the

30
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,460
Speaker 2:  verges Ash perish is here to tell us, hi Ash. Hi David,

31
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,280
Speaker 2:  how are you? I'm good. I'm torn about how I feel about this game. And it's

32
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,720
Speaker 2:  causing me to feel a lot of feelings, but we're gonna come. We're gonna come

33
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,640
Speaker 2:  back to those in a minute, but let's talk through this leak a little

34
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,000
Speaker 2:  bit, because like in the video game world, like we see leaks all the time.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,880
Speaker 2:  Everybody has sort of there's different stuff coming out about different

36
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,000
Speaker 2:  games. Everything is always rumored and reported. It seems like a very small

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Speaker 2:  industry that is full of people who like to talk, give me a sense of like

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,730
Speaker 2:  how big a deal, something like this GTA six leak

39
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,570
Speaker 2:  is in the scheme of things.

40
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,990
Speaker 4:  So leaks are never good. From a development

41
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,320
Speaker 4:  standpoint, gamers have a reputation of being

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,200
Speaker 4:  extremely hostile. They get very emotional

43
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,160
Speaker 4:  about the things that they love and it

44
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,080
Speaker 4:  manifests in this weird like hostility, because you realize that

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,920
Speaker 4:  these, these games that they love, the people that they're making it, they

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,120
Speaker 4:  make their lives like harder because they believe, at least some of them

47
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,200
Speaker 4:  believe they have some kind of like entitlement issue with these things that

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,880
Speaker 4:  they don't make or whatever, and have no idea how they're made. So

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,770
Speaker 4:  leaks, especially like the one with the GTA six leak where it's clearly

50
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,640
Speaker 4:  in development assets, it was like over 90 videos. It

51
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,410
Speaker 4:  was like debugging. Like the developers were going through and debugging,

52
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,240
Speaker 4:  mission scripts and things like that. So in the videos that you could see,

53
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,360
Speaker 4:  like a lot of textures haven't been added, there's a lot of like placeholder

54
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,720
Speaker 4:  assets, placeholder text, things like that. It's not the most

55
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,440
Speaker 4:  polished of looking things. So people

56
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,360
Speaker 4:  see this and they, they see that this is like still a work in progress,

57
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,480
Speaker 4:  but they don't really like conceptualize that this is still in progress.

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,140
Speaker 4:  So they believe like, oh, this game looks like ass. It's gonna be terrible.

59
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,120
Speaker 4:  And then, you know, people are, are talking about this on social media

60
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,110
Speaker 4:  and the stock price tanks, like, like the stock price for take two,

61
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,000
Speaker 4:  I believe like took a little dip by this because people are having all these

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,720
Speaker 4:  negative opinions about this game that is still like two or three years out

63
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,480
Speaker 4:  from being released because you know, children can't don't

64
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,080
Speaker 4:  realize that this is something that still is being worked on. It wasn't meant

65
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,910
Speaker 4:  to be seen like this. So it's a big deal. Developers

66
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,160
Speaker 4:  hate it. They get on social media and they say like, this makes

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,120
Speaker 4:  everybody's job harder. Like this is counterintuitive to what you

68
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,920
Speaker 4:  guys want. You know, the way that this leak was happened and the way

69
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,660
Speaker 4:  people respond to it, it's just, it's just this big negative thing.

70
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,070
Speaker 4:  And that's, that's what we're dealing with right now.

71
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I feel like I have a really hard time imagining any world in which

72
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,160
Speaker 2:  it goes the other way, where like elite comes out like this and everybody's

73
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,560
Speaker 2:  like, ah, looks awesome. Great job rockstar. Keep doing what you're doing.

74
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,440
Speaker 2:  It's just like, not how this world of gaming works. That like,

75
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,040
Speaker 2:  of course, as soon as something comes out, like this, people are gonna find

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Speaker 2:  things to be mad about in part, because it's like in progress code and in

77
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,240
Speaker 2:  part, because that's just how people react to this stuff, right? Like, it's

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,000
Speaker 2:  like you were saying, I think with video games, it more than almost anything

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Speaker 2:  else, people feel this sense of like ownership over everything

80
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,230
Speaker 2:  and anything that comes out that is this much different from

81
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,200
Speaker 2:  what they think they want or expect or whatever people

82
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,680
Speaker 2:  are gonna freak out. So there was, I can't imagine a world in which this

83
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,360
Speaker 2:  went better, even if it was some like totally different kind of game or footage

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,440
Speaker 2:  that leaked. Right.

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,180
Speaker 4:  Right. But it's really funny that you said that because

86
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,800
Speaker 4:  not too long after the GTA six leak Diablo four,

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
Speaker 4:  the game that blizzard is working on also leaked with like 43 minutes of

88
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,320
Speaker 4:  footage. And I feel like people had a much more positive reaction

89
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,240
Speaker 4:  to that than they did to DTA six. Yeah. I mean, it still like

90
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,200
Speaker 4:  had the same issues that GTA six did like it, there was still

91
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,080
Speaker 4:  like assets that hadn't been loaded in. But I think because of the way that

92
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,950
Speaker 4:  the leak was like perpetrated, like the GTA six leak, somebody

93
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,640
Speaker 4:  hacked into rockstar servers and stole like in

94
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,520
Speaker 4:  development footage, the Diablo four leak was because I guess

95
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,360
Speaker 4:  somebody was granted access to like a friends and family beta and

96
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,920
Speaker 4:  they streamed it to not on like Twitch or anything like that. But through

97
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,610
Speaker 4:  discord and somebody recorded that footage and then leaked that footage.

98
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,200
Speaker 4:  So it might be because like Diablo four looks like a little bit more further

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Speaker 4:  along in the development cycle. I mean, it should be, the game is supposed

100
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,120
Speaker 4:  to come out sometime next year. Maybe that's why people are responding more

101
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,840
Speaker 4:  positively to it. So there are cases as slim as it is where people

102
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,910
Speaker 4:  can see like, oh, okay. Yeah, this looks cool.

103
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. I mean, that's, that's sort of encouraging actually. And it does

104
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,840
Speaker 2:  feel like the fact that this is happening to grant theft auto specifically

105
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,670
Speaker 2:  is sort of fascinating. Cause GTA is this like legendary

106
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,340
Speaker 2:  series, tons of people. Like it it's very popular, but it also,

107
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,360
Speaker 2:  the last time I had this very funny moment when this league happened of,

108
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,000
Speaker 2:  I haven't played GTA in a long time, but I had a pretty like when GTA five

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,480
Speaker 2:  first came out, which was good Lord, like a, almost a decade ago.

110
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,590
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Nine years

111
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,200
Speaker 2:  I played a bunch of it and it was grand theft auto, but like, it was fun.

112
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,440
Speaker 2:  And I enjoyed it for the same reasons running around and punching strangers

113
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,400
Speaker 2:  in the face in a video game is fun. Like it's cool. And then I went back

114
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,800
Speaker 2:  and I was like, oh, I wonder what's, you know, really changed in the game

115
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,560
Speaker 2:  since I, I stopped playing it, if there's a bunch of, and it was like, Nope,

116
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,800
Speaker 2:  nothing has changed. It's just, they're still selling you grand theft auto

117
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Speaker 2:  five. And this is just where we are. So is this like, are people

118
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,560
Speaker 2:  just so pent up waiting for this new game? That seems like it's been out

119
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,360
Speaker 2:  and debated and rumored for so long that everybody is like desperate

120
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,910
Speaker 2:  for this thing to come out. So they have very strong feelings about it.

121
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,660
Speaker 4:  I think so. Yeah. There has been a very long lag time between

122
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,640
Speaker 4:  GTA five and now GTA six, we've only just heard that GTA

123
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,560
Speaker 4:  six was in development maybe a couple years ago. And you know, GTA

124
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,280
Speaker 4:  five has become like rockstar Skyrim. Right. They re-release it

125
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,000
Speaker 4:  for every console. I believe you can play it on mobile

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,840
Speaker 4:  now. Like it, it came out when the Xbox 360 was still a thing. Right. That's

127
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,760
Speaker 4:  wild. So it's gone through two console generations in that meantime between

128
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,680
Speaker 4:  time and now because people are like anxious and desperate for

129
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,200
Speaker 4:  something more, they've probably built up this idea in their heads of what

130
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,160
Speaker 4:  they expect, you know, GT six to look like. And, you know, they have high

131
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,560
Speaker 4:  expectations on rockstar because generally speaking rockstar delivers

132
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,310
Speaker 4:  Fantastics like narrative and gameplay experiences. So

133
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,160
Speaker 4:  yeah, like these people like expect it to be something. And maybe

134
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,400
Speaker 4:  because it's not meeting that expectations because we're looking at stuff

135
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,040
Speaker 4:  that's been in development that is at least two years old that they're, they're

136
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,720
Speaker 4:  having a hard time coping. Right.

137
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,000
Speaker 2:  Are you a grand theft auto person?

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,880
Speaker 4:  Absolutely not, not my wheelhouse.

139
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,440
Speaker 4:  Sorry. Why not? It's just not the kind of game that appeals to me personally.

140
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,520
Speaker 4:  Like I that's fair, appreciate it like aesthetically and from a distance.

141
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,360
Speaker 4:  And I understand that a lot of people have a lot of emotions tied into it

142
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,840
Speaker 4:  and a lot of other rockstar games, because I know people love red, dead redemption

143
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,760
Speaker 4:  too, to death. And just not for me, just not for me,

144
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,890
Speaker 4:  which is fine.

145
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,480
Speaker 2:  So what did we learn about this actual game that's coming from this footage?

146
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,440
Speaker 2:  We, we kind of had heard reportedly that there was gonna be a, a female protagonist,

147
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,080
Speaker 2:  which seems to be confirmed. Now, did we learn any new stuff about what this

148
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,090
Speaker 2:  game is gonna be?

149
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,040
Speaker 4:  So Jason Schreyer at Bloomberg reported on this early in the

150
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,520
Speaker 4:  year that there would be a female protagonist. The, there there was, I think

151
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,440
Speaker 4:  there's supposed to be like two protagonists, like a male and a female. And

152
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,400
Speaker 4:  they're supposed to be based on Bonnie and Clyde. I think we got a little

153
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,120
Speaker 4:  bit of that. We also got the fact that this is gonna be set

154
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,080
Speaker 4:  somewhere in Miami. I believe Jason's reporting also spoke

155
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,550
Speaker 4:  something about it. Reviving the vice city setting

156
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,440
Speaker 4:  that happened with like GTA three. I believe it was. So it seems

157
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,130
Speaker 4:  like that's where the setting is, but I don't think beyond that

158
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,040
Speaker 4:  we have much more information other than, you know, it's, it's vice

159
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,880
Speaker 4:  city again or something vice city adjacent, and we're gonna be able to play

160
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,490
Speaker 4:  as a woman.

161
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,440
Speaker 2:  It was funny watching some of the leaked videos because on the one

162
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
Speaker 2:  hand, it like, it feels very grand theft auto. Like there's a, there's a

163
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,760
Speaker 2:  whole scene where they're driving down the street in a stolen cop car with

164
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,480
Speaker 2:  the, the driver door sort of swinging open into stuff. And then there's like

165
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,880
Speaker 2:  that whole weird punching style that they it's like. It feels very grand

166
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,440
Speaker 2:  theft auto. And I wonder if that's one of the things people are responding

167
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,320
Speaker 2:  to that it's like, if, if we, if it's been a decade and you're still giving

168
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,440
Speaker 2:  us a game that just feels like slightly newer, grand theft auto, like what

169
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,720
Speaker 2:  have we been waiting for all this time? But then again, this is all like

170
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,600
Speaker 2:  debug footage from at least two years ago. And it's just, it's very

171
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,240
Speaker 2:  hard to sort through kind of what we know and what we don't even

172
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,670
Speaker 2:  from a leak this big,

173
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,440
Speaker 4:  Well, I guess I would say personally, like if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

174
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,360
Speaker 4:  Right. There's a reason why we're, you know, doing NBA two K

175
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,000
Speaker 4:  2023, because it makes billions and billions of dollars,

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,680
Speaker 4:  right? GTA three and four and five

177
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,840
Speaker 4:  we're, you know, they were different stories, but they kind of like all did

178
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,800
Speaker 4:  the same thing. And with GTA five, being able to be sold across

179
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,400
Speaker 4:  two different console generations and still making gobs and gobs of money

180
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,790
Speaker 4:  as it does, same with GTA online, which is like the same thing. But

181
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,960
Speaker 4:  online where it's like a shared world or whatever, if it ain't broke, don't

182
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,240
Speaker 4:  fix it. Right? Like you can add some new adoration in it to it. But like

183
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,160
Speaker 4:  as long as it's fits that traditional GTA formula, people are gonna buy it.

184
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,880
Speaker 4:  They're gonna eat it up. So, I mean, I'm not saying that GTA six, isn't

185
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,290
Speaker 4:  innovative cuz you know, we don't know anything about it, but from, you know,

186
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,750
Speaker 4:  an academic standpoint. Yeah. It makes sense that this is like the

187
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,680
Speaker 4:  same-ish. I mean, I guess we'll

188
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,200
Speaker 2:  See. No, that that's totally fair. And part of me wonders like big picture

189
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,920
Speaker 2:  for a company like rockstar when something like this happens, what

190
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,910
Speaker 2:  goes on internally? The, the response they've given so far is basically like,

191
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,400
Speaker 2:  bummer. This happened, we're still moving ahead. Right? Like, do we have

192
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,050
Speaker 2:  any sense of what happens in a company like that after a leak like this?

193
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,840
Speaker 4:  So not really. I mean, it's terrible. Like

194
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,600
Speaker 4:  the developers feel awful. I feel like more than anything, it's a huge

195
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,440
Speaker 4:  hit to morale because now the poor community managers and whoever has the

196
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,960
Speaker 4:  keys to the social media have defend off like thousands of Twitter,

197
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,760
Speaker 4:  anime profile avatars, like tweeting abuse at them because their game,

198
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,320
Speaker 4:  which is unfinished and clearly in development, looks like crap to

199
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,160
Speaker 4:  them. But it seems like there's like, not much you can

200
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,820
Speaker 4:  do about this. Like from a, like a public standpoint,

201
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,960
Speaker 4:  you can't really do anything, but keep on keeping on. Right? So they put

202
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,520
Speaker 4:  out their statement saying this was the result of a hack. It sucks that you

203
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,240
Speaker 4:  learn about this game before we were ready to show you, but this hasn't

204
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,080
Speaker 4:  deterred our ability to get this game to you at all. Like, I don't

205
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,560
Speaker 4:  think they said anything about it being delayed or anything like that. But

206
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,120
Speaker 4:  the sense that I get is that this is far more like an internal morale thing,

207
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,880
Speaker 4:  more than anything else. But Jason Schreyer again at Bloomberg also brought

208
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,360
Speaker 4:  up the fact that this might have a problem or this might impact

209
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,280
Speaker 4:  Rockstar's ability to have their employees work from home because of

210
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,160
Speaker 4:  the way that this hack happened. Because the way that I understand it, the

211
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,120
Speaker 4:  guy who hacked Uber is claiming responsibility from this and the way that

212
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,770
Speaker 4:  he hacked Uber was through social engineering. And so while

213
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,760
Speaker 4:  he hasn't like said like, or rockstar, didn't say like this was social engineering

214
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,640
Speaker 4:  specifically, people are kind of like drawing the connections. If this guy

215
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,520
Speaker 4:  really did do Uber and rockstar, it stands to reason that he might have used

216
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,720
Speaker 4:  the same tactics of social engineering, like impersonating it or something

217
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,040
Speaker 4:  like that, to get somebody to give up their login so they can get into the

218
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,920
Speaker 4:  servers and take whatever they want. So it might impact employee's ability

219
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,360
Speaker 4:  to work from home because you know, rockstar wants to lock it down a little

220
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,080
Speaker 4:  bit better. And it's hard to do that when you've got employees far flung

221
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,680
Speaker 4:  across wherever. Totally

222
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,800
Speaker 2:  Well, and I think there's also this bigger picture that if I, if I really

223
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,760
Speaker 2:  like put on my galaxy brain hat, this is all happening at this really

224
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,400
Speaker 2:  interesting moment in the games industry, right. Where there's been this

225
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,000
Speaker 2:  reckoning over the last couple of years about like the internal cultures

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,560
Speaker 2:  of these companies and companies are starting to unionize and, and the whole

227
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,320
Speaker 2:  sort of concept of crunches coming to real scrutiny. So there's this, like,

228
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Speaker 2:  this industry feels like it's changing and there's like this internal tension

229
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,960
Speaker 2:  of a lot of these companies. And I certainly don't have any evidence that,

230
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,720
Speaker 2:  that is like connected to the fact that it seems like these companies are

231
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,200
Speaker 2:  also getting leakier. But part of me wonders, like if I were to sort of play

232
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,760
Speaker 2:  the 10 dimensional chess here, if these things might be connected, but maybe

233
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,990
Speaker 2:  I'm trying too hard on that one.

234
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,790
Speaker 4:  That's interesting. I never really associated this like kind of,

235
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,600
Speaker 4:  I don't, I don't wanna say loosening with the idea that these companies might

236
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,590
Speaker 4:  be opening themselves up to more dramatic breaches like this.

237
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,040
Speaker 4:  I mean, I'll say that we didn't need to be in this like kind of work from

238
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,640
Speaker 4:  home culture to have leaks like this happen it's happened before when

239
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,560
Speaker 4:  everybody was in the office crunching, you know, 14 hour days and

240
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,240
Speaker 4:  it's happened now. So it's always gonna be a thing. So I don't think, think

241
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,760
Speaker 4:  you can say that, you know, these new work from home policies and this lack

242
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,560
Speaker 4:  of crunch policies mean that more of this will happen. I mean,

243
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,800
Speaker 4:  just the other day, like, you know, leaks are happening because this guy

244
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,880
Speaker 4:  was breaking NDAs left and right. And he was just doing it for the cloud.

245
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,080
Speaker 4:  So it's like, it doesn't, it doesn't really matter, honestly, where people

246
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,840
Speaker 4:  are, this is gonna happen if determined individuals want it to happen. But

247
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,600
Speaker 4:  yeah, people are shining way more of a light on how

248
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,500
Speaker 4:  these big ticket AAA games are being made. And at least

249
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,120
Speaker 4:  the people that I follow are saying like, take the time that you need, we

250
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,920
Speaker 4:  don't need this. Like right now we would prefer your employees. Get these

251
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,840
Speaker 4:  games done safely. Healthly if that means it takes a

252
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,000
Speaker 4:  little bit longer, that's fine because nobody wants to do this anymore. Like

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,520
Speaker 4:  nobody wants to crunch. Nobody wants to hear stories of like people losing

254
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,230
Speaker 4:  their families or whatever, because they had to work 17 hours a day. So

255
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,310
Speaker 4:  yeah. I mean, that's, I guess the thing that I'm seeing.

256
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, it makes total sense. And it seems like at the same time, and this

257
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,920
Speaker 2:  is kind of what you're talking about. Like these industries are just so sprawling

258
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,520
Speaker 2:  now that it's like just the sheer number of people involved

259
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,320
Speaker 2:  with building a game, like GTA six across like

260
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,480
Speaker 2:  different companies and partners. And it's like, there are people who work

261
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
Speaker 2:  for like cloud services who know all the video games that are coming in the

262
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
Speaker 2:  next few years. Right. And that's never been a thing before. I wonder if

263
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,480
Speaker 2:  this is gonna continue as this industry and these companies get bigger,

264
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,200
Speaker 2:  it's gonna get harder and harder for them to keep stuff like this under

265
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Speaker 2:  wraps over time. I mean, it's like, it's like consumer devices, right? It's

266
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,440
Speaker 2:  like, it's always the accessory makers that leak them. And now in the world

267
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,040
Speaker 2:  of video games that are on streaming services and are on, on a million different

268
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,080
Speaker 2:  partners and have to sort of trickle out into the world in all these complicated

269
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,280
Speaker 2:  ways. I wonder if we're gonna start to see more of this happen rather than

270
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,270
Speaker 2:  less over time.

271
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,950
Speaker 4:  I mean, we'll see, it happens a lot. You know, some

272
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,840
Speaker 4:  storefront in Brazil will accidentally leak like the release date of some

273
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,830
Speaker 4:  game because of, you know, whatever. So you know, it it's

274
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,240
Speaker 4:  it's anybody's guess, but I don't think it'll be anymore any less than what

275
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,830
Speaker 4:  we've seen in the past. Being honest.

276
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,560
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. Alright. Well, what game are you playing right now? If you're

277
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,000
Speaker 2:  not playing GTA?

278
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,880
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, I'm not playing GTA right now. I am playing metal health singer,

279
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,760
Speaker 4:  which is a rhythm shooter. So it is it's

280
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,230
Speaker 4:  on Xbox game pass. It's also on steam. You play as like a

281
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,160
Speaker 4:  Demonn who lost her voice, who is fighting through like the realms

282
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,120
Speaker 4:  of hell to get her voice back. And the way that it works is that like there's

283
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,640
Speaker 4:  metal like heavy metal tracks in a playing in the background and you have

284
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,880
Speaker 4:  to shoot on the beat. And when you shoot on the beat, you get a higher score

285
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,930
Speaker 4:  multiplier and you do more damage. It's a lot of fun.

286
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,720
Speaker 2:  Oh, that sounds awesome. All right. Sold for who needs GTA six. I'm gonna

287
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,760
Speaker 2:  go play that instead. You

288
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,440
Speaker 4:  Should.

289
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,600
Speaker 2:  All right, Ash. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank

290
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,070
Speaker 4:  You so much for having me.

291
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,720
Speaker 2:  Okay. We're gonna take a break and then we're gonna go deep down the TikTok

292
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,240
Speaker 2:  search engine rabbit hole. There's this idea out there that young people

293
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,000
Speaker 2:  are using TikTok instead of Google. And I'm suspicious

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,460
Speaker 2:  of that. We'll be right back.

295
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,460
Speaker 1:  Welcome

296
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,340
Speaker 2:  Back. I wanna talk now about something I heard a few weeks ago and had

297
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,860
Speaker 2:  been thinking about basically constantly ever

298
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,780
Speaker 2:  since. So in July, there was

299
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,650
Speaker 2:  the fortune brainstorm tech conference, which is one of those fancy

300
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,460
Speaker 2:  thinky tech conferences for fancy people. It's held in Aspen and

301
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,660
Speaker 2:  it's designed to be one of those places where people come to talk about big

302
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,230
Speaker 2:  ideas and the future and whatever. And in the middle of the conference,

303
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,860
Speaker 2:  provoca Raghavan who is in SVP at Google and is for all intent

304
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,500
Speaker 2:  purposes. The guy in charge of search at Google said this on

305
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:19,990
Speaker 2:  stage

306
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,750
Speaker 7:  Younger people don't come with preset expectations

307
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,620
Speaker 7:  in our studies, something like almost 40% of young

308
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,420
Speaker 7:  people. When they're looking for a place for lunch, they don't go to

309
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,220
Speaker 7:  Google maps or search. They go to TikTok or Instagram. So the journey

310
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,940
Speaker 7:  begins in different forms than before in visually rich forms.

311
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,700
Speaker 2:  Again, this is the guy in charge of Google search, one of the

312
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,580
Speaker 2:  most powerful and popular products on the internet, the source of billions

313
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,080
Speaker 2:  and billions of dollars in revenue for Google every year saying

314
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,900
Speaker 2:  essentially that the search engines of the future might be TikTok and Instagram,

315
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,760
Speaker 2:  not Google Provo's point

316
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,280
Speaker 2:  made a lot of headlines in part, because it also seems to confirm the way

317
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,200
Speaker 2:  that younger internet users use the internet. More videos, more

318
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,910
Speaker 2:  photos, less typing. What Google likes to call keyword, ease

319
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,880
Speaker 2:  into text boxes. I'm really not convinced that the world is

320
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,520
Speaker 2:  as provoca makes it sound here though. There's no doubt that search is changing

321
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,000
Speaker 2:  and becoming more multimedia. I mean, just look at the fact that YouTube

322
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,640
Speaker 2:  has long been the second most popular search engine on the planet, just behind

323
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,430
Speaker 2:  Google and even Google is using lens and voice to become

324
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,830
Speaker 2:  more multimedia

325
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,320
Speaker 8:  Soon. You'll be able to point lens at something and ask questions about what

326
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,540
Speaker 8:  you see,

327
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,410
Speaker 2:  But you know, who has a huge incentive to make it sound like Google

328
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,910
Speaker 2:  is not the only company that matters in search

329
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,470
Speaker 2:  Google.

330
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,120
Speaker 9:  Good morning. We welcome everyone to this. Morning's hearing on

331
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,960
Speaker 9:  transparency and accountability, examining Google and its

332
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,170
Speaker 9:  data collection use and filtering practices.

333
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,040
Speaker 2:  If it can convince the world that TikTok and Instagram are real

334
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,550
Speaker 2:  threats, it can maybe make regulators in particular,

335
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,820
Speaker 2:  just slightly less concerned about what it's doing on its search engine.

336
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,360
Speaker 2:  But it's definitely true that TikTok in particular is

337
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,160
Speaker 2:  investing in search. It's starting to offer search ideas on your, for you

338
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,880
Speaker 2:  page and you can actually even see in the content that people are

339
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,840
Speaker 2:  starting to do stuff that's more designed to be helpful and evergreen

340
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,040
Speaker 2:  rather than like dance challenges.

341
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,520
Speaker 10:  Here's the tutorial on how to tie your tie the easiest way. First you're

342
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,640
Speaker 10:  gonna place it in your hands like

343
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,630
Speaker 2:  This. So I decided to try this out and see if TikTok is actually

344
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,280
Speaker 2:  a good search engine. For a few days, I tried to search almost

345
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,240
Speaker 2:  everything on TikTok before I looked for it on Google. And I started

346
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,430
Speaker 2:  with the thing that provoca mentioned at the conference, looking for lunch.

347
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:43,090
Speaker 2:  I searched the phrase, restaurants in my neighborhood and got just nothing.

348
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,120
Speaker 2:  It turns out TikTok, doesn't know where I live and doesn't know what I'm

349
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,040
Speaker 2:  looking for. But then I searched for restaurants in Delray VA, which is where

350
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,960
Speaker 2:  I live. And I got some useful stuff, Matt and Tony's is a good spot. So

351
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,130
Speaker 11:  We do American comfort food breakfast all day.

352
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,880
Speaker 2:  So is Delray cafe hungry

353
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,080
Speaker 12:  In Virginia, check out Delray cafe when

354
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,160
Speaker 2:  Visiting, make sure you have the next result was one in Delray beach, which

355
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,120
Speaker 2:  is in California and literally thousands of miles from me. Then I

356
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,270
Speaker 2:  got pork barrel barbecue, which is near me and also pretty good.

357
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,880
Speaker 13:  Here's one of their most favorite platters. It's a barbecued

358
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,720
Speaker 13:  rib sausage and they've got

359
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,200
Speaker 2:  This whole thing kind of works right. Then it was another Matt and Tony's

360
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,940
Speaker 2:  recommendation. Then back to California, then more California.

361
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,560
Speaker 2:  And then Matt and Tony's again, we

362
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,480
Speaker 14:  Are at Matt and Tony's and yes, the snow did not stop us from trying

363
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,360
Speaker 2:  To, I don't know that the information density here is super high. It took

364
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,280
Speaker 2:  a really long time for me to basically get three names of restaurants, but

365
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,920
Speaker 2:  it does work. And while we're on the subject of food, TikTok is actually

366
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,840
Speaker 2:  an amazing tool for recipes. You type in like chocolate chip

367
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,400
Speaker 2:  cookies and you can spend the rest of your life. Watching people

368
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,010
Speaker 2:  make delicious looking chocolate chip cookies.

369
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,880
Speaker 15:  My holy grail, cookie chocolate chip cookie bars are the

370
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,520
Speaker 2:  Goat. A lot of those videos move really fast. So you have to watch them a

371
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,440
Speaker 2:  bunch of times and take notes, but there is a ton of good information here.

372
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,120
Speaker 2:  Just listen

373
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,330
Speaker 16:  To, despite

374
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,120
Speaker 2:  They're eating talkers who go through other Toks to find the best

375
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,520
Speaker 2:  chocolate chip cookie recipes from TikTok to show you on TikTok.

376
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,720
Speaker 15:  And I scoured the seemingly endless collection of chocolate chip cookie

377
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,280
Speaker 15:  recipes on TikTok to bring you

378
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,560
Speaker 2:  These it's bananas today,

379
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Speaker 17:  We're making soft banana chocolate chip cookies. So grab your dusty ass,

380
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,280
Speaker 17:  ripe bananas coffee.

381
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,760
Speaker 2:  What doesn't work here at all is actually the number one

382
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,520
Speaker 2:  thing people use Google for opening webpage. The

383
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,880
Speaker 2:  main reason most people go to Google search is to get to

384
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,800
Speaker 2:  like Facebook and YouTube and Amazon. They type in those words into

385
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,680
Speaker 2:  the search box. TikTok just won't help you there. It's also not at all

386
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,400
Speaker 2:  useful for answering basic questions. Like what time is it, which is number

387
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,680
Speaker 2:  four on the list of most asked questions in Google. According to one study

388
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,460
Speaker 2:  I found and how manys in a cup, which is number five on that list.

389
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,360
Speaker 2:  But the number one question on Google, according to that same study is what

390
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,160
Speaker 2:  to watch. People just want to know what TV and movies to watch. And TikTok

391
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,760
Speaker 2:  is pretty interesting there. It was

392
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,000
Speaker 18:  Literally called Devilman cry baby, which is like the hardest title I've

393
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,400
Speaker 2:  Ever heard. The first video I got when I searched was bunch of recommendations

394
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,870
Speaker 2:  for stuff to watch on Netflix.

395
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,050
Speaker 18:  This is a show for the dudes and the guys.

396
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,000
Speaker 2:  Another was the new shows coming out on streaming, but that video

397
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,160
Speaker 2:  was several weeks old. So they weren't that new anymore. The

398
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,740
Speaker 19:  Resort will be coming out on peacock. It's a black comedy,

399
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,820
Speaker 2:  But it still was kind of helpful.

400
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,013
Speaker 19:  And it stars William Jackson,

401
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:24,120
Speaker 2:  Harper film. Another one was stuff to watch after you finished the summer,

402
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,890
Speaker 2:  I turned pretty, which I did watch and did very much enjoy.

403
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,280
Speaker 20:  My top recommendation has to be Dawson was

404
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,480
Speaker 2:  Creek. This is actually a really helpful set of results. Early

405
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,000
Speaker 20:  Two thousands, one of my

406
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,880
Speaker 2:  Top 10. Okay. Let's keep going. Music is all over the most popular

407
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,720
Speaker 2:  Google search results as is people looking for broad topics, Googling

408
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,520
Speaker 2:  things like Fortnite, well damaging Alma, build your ASMR. What's your favorite

409
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,480
Speaker 2:  color. And Billy Eish in that world, you're not looking for anything

410
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,160
Speaker 2:  in particular, just something in that genre and

411
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,960
Speaker 2:  TikTok is like an endless supply of all of that.

412
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,590
Speaker 21:  Here's one for all you Billy Eilish fans.

413
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,320
Speaker 2:  Also movie trailers are a good one. Mortal combat movie. 2021

414
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,040
Speaker 2:  was one of the most search things on Google. I am

415
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,500
Speaker 22:  Sub zero

416
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,430
Speaker 2:  And Godzilla versus Kong was also at the top of that list.

417
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,320
Speaker 2:  TikTok covers all of that really well though. You don't usually get

418
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,040
Speaker 2:  full songs or full trailers. And a lot of times you get remixes and jokes

419
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,120
Speaker 2:  before the actual content you might be looking

420
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,820
Speaker 2:  for.

421
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,790
Speaker 2:  You can imagine, by the way, why TikTok might be interested in making

422
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,360
Speaker 2:  a full music app to give people easier paths to this kind of

423
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,200
Speaker 2:  stuff. It seems to me that Google really

424
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,400
Speaker 2:  shouldn't be worried about TikTok as a search engine. You look at the stuff

425
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,200
Speaker 2:  people search and it's us PS tracking and weather tomorrow. And what

426
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,920
Speaker 2:  time is the super bowl? Google is obviously lots of things to lots of people,

427
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,870
Speaker 2:  but it's mostly a glorified question and answer service or

428
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,600
Speaker 2:  a way to find more information on the internet. TikTok is just not set up

429
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,430
Speaker 2:  to do that, but you know, who should be afraid of TikTok search is YouTube.

430
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,280
Speaker 23:  Okay. So a common problem I hear from people when making rice is that it

431
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,940
Speaker 23:  gets stuck to the bottom of the pot.

432
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,760
Speaker 2:  One thing that jumped out to me is hashtag TikTok taught me, which is a huge

433
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,720
Speaker 2:  success story. And it goes right at the kind of DIY, how

434
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,160
Speaker 2:  do I change a tire or kind of content that YouTube is so well known for

435
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,720
Speaker 2:  personally. One thing I keep searching for is back stretches because I have

436
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,340
Speaker 2:  back problems and I sit in front of computer all day and it's just overall

437
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,320
Speaker 2:  bad news. TikTok is perfect for this and the videos don't

438
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,280
Speaker 2:  come with those long preambles you get on YouTube. I don't need 14 minutes

439
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,120
Speaker 2:  of personal history before you show me the stretches. It's just 32nd video

440
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,340
Speaker 2:  of stretches after 32nd video of stretches and it rules,

441
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,760
Speaker 24:  I'm going to grip into the door frame with my hands slightly below chin

442
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,770
Speaker 24:  level. Let's take our chin towards our chest

443
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,760
Speaker 2:  As far as quick, helpful visual information. TikTok is

444
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,600
Speaker 2:  actually a much more efficient system than YouTube. I don't think the results

445
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,520
Speaker 2:  are always as good, but TikTok does make it easier to just flip through your

446
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,920
Speaker 2:  options to find one that works. It's less of a search engine and more of

447
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,760
Speaker 2:  like a choose your own rabbit hole adventure story, which

448
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,240
Speaker 2:  is a new, but kind of fun way to think about

449
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,160
Speaker 2:  search. I will say though,

450
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,960
Speaker 2:  if search really is a long term focus for TikTok, the platform is

451
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,200
Speaker 2:  definitely going to need to change a bit right now, for instance, creators

452
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,040
Speaker 2:  only get the one link in their bio. So there are tons of folks who are just

453
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,880
Speaker 2:  like, I posted my new recipe and make a video to show it off. But

454
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,600
Speaker 2:  then by the time you get to that video, that link is gone. Also,

455
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,480
Speaker 2:  TikTok is still all about the, for you page, which means people are using

456
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,210
Speaker 2:  sounds and doing challenges and generally doing everything they can

457
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,520
Speaker 2:  to show up, right? When you open the app longer in depth,

458
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,960
Speaker 2:  evergreen, helpful how to change a tire content.

459
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,440
Speaker 2:  Isn't really gonna work in that space. So TikTok is going to have to find

460
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,210
Speaker 2:  a way to incentivize people, to make more search friendly stuff.

461
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,880
Speaker 2:  If it really wants to take on YouTube that way, all of this is to

462
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,840
Speaker 2:  say, I don't think Google is under any actual threat here. I don't

463
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,680
Speaker 2:  think 40% of people are gonna keep using Instagram and TikTok, even

464
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,080
Speaker 2:  if that was ever the case, but it is not the only search engine worth using

465
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,640
Speaker 2:  anymore. For a lot of things, 10 blue links is still the right

466
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,520
Speaker 2:  answer, but for a lot of others, it turns out an endless stream of vertical

467
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,400
Speaker 2:  video might be even better. I don't know that I'll ever end

468
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,520
Speaker 2:  up actually making these chocolate chip cookies that I've been staring at

469
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,920
Speaker 2:  for hours and hours and hours, but it's really fun to watch other people

470
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,400
Speaker 2:  make them. And that might be just good

471
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:32,310
Speaker 2:  enough.

472
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,380
Speaker 1:  Welcome

473
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,100
Speaker 2:  Back now that we've posted our reviews and had a chance to test some of

474
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,860
Speaker 2:  Apple's new phones and watches. We asked you to send in your biggest, most

475
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,380
Speaker 2:  burning questions about the new stuff to our Vergecast hotline, which don't

476
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,980
Speaker 2:  forget is it's six, six verge one, one, and you can also always record a

477
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,860
Speaker 2:  voice memo and send it to vergecast@theverge.com. That works too. Thanks

478
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,260
Speaker 2:  to everybody who called in. We really love hearing from you and please keep

479
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,110
Speaker 2:  calling with all of your burning tech questions about apple or otherwise.

480
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,060
Speaker 2:  We got a lot of questions about apple, so I'm sorry. We're not gonna be able

481
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,220
Speaker 2:  to get to everyone's voicemails, but we are gonna try to answer some of the

482
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,060
Speaker 2:  most common ones and some of the most fun ones let's dig into the

483
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,900
Speaker 2:  phone a bit first, which means I should bring in Allison Johnson who reviewed

484
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,580
Speaker 2:  the iPhone 14 and Eli Patel who reviewed the 14 pro hi

485
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,420
Speaker 2:  Eli. Hey

486
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,120
Speaker 1:  Buddy. How you doing?

487
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,880
Speaker 2:  I'm good. Hi Allison. Hello, fresh off of iPhone

488
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,360
Speaker 2:  reviews. Everyone has recovered ish. I tried to buy an iPhone this weekend

489
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,800
Speaker 2:  and I failed. I'm devastated about

490
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,760
Speaker 26:  It. Oh no. Just from watching football on Sunday, every carrier

491
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,280
Speaker 26:  in America will just throw an iPhone at you. If you get anywhere near their

492
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,510
Speaker 26:  stores. From what I understand,

493
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,960
Speaker 27:  It's very difficult to pay for one.

494
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I managed to get my dad an iPhone Promax, which

495
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,600
Speaker 2:  he's very excited about. And my mom, an iPhone pro, which she's very excited

496
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,400
Speaker 2:  about. And literally those were the last two that apple had available in

497
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,480
Speaker 2:  the store. And so they were just like, David, you get nothing. Okay. But

498
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,200
Speaker 2:  anyway, we have a bunch of hotline questions. Let's just dive into them.

499
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,860
Speaker 2:  So I think Andrew let's just play the first one.

500
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,680
Speaker 28:  Hey, David in vercast team. So I've been a long time user of Android for

501
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,360
Speaker 28:  the last five or six years. So originally was an iPhone user and with the

502
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,320
Speaker 28:  new iPhone 14 in the dynamic island had me considering

503
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,500
Speaker 28:  switching back to iPhone. I originally switched because it was customizable,

504
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,440
Speaker 28:  but I wonder now is iPhone more customizable than Android? Can

505
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,110
Speaker 28:  you crash that itch if you need it really curious about your thoughts. Thanks.

506
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,200
Speaker 2:  I have thoughts on this, but ne you made a face while we were listening to

507
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,360
Speaker 2:  that question. Why did you make a face?

508
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,840
Speaker 26:  Because the answer is flatly. No, the iPhone is not more customizable for

509
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,640
Speaker 26:  Android. It is more customizable than iPhones

510
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,600
Speaker 26:  in the past, and it's getting closer to Android,

511
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,080
Speaker 26:  but your average Android phone, I mean, you can just replace the app

512
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,920
Speaker 26:  launcher. I mean, you do anything. You want an Android phone, so it, it

513
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,720
Speaker 26:  just depends on what itch you are trying to scratch, I

514
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,200
Speaker 26:  guess. But if you're like an all out customizer, I think Android's still

515
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,600
Speaker 26:  where it's at.

516
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,110
Speaker 2:  Allison. Is that your take two?

517
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,600
Speaker 27:  Yeah. And it's, it's gotten better. It's gotten, there's a lot more you

518
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,230
Speaker 27:  can do now than in the past apples slowly, adding

519
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,110
Speaker 27:  more things we can do. Like, you know, the lock screens are fine, but

520
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,040
Speaker 27:  you're still definitely playing within the realm of what apple thinks

521
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,800
Speaker 27:  looks good. They do not want you to walk around with an

522
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,520
Speaker 27:  ugly iPhone lock screen, cuz that would embarrass them

523
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,290
Speaker 27:  Android. You can make it as ugly as you want, if you wanna do that.

524
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:38,200
Speaker 27:  So yeah. Yeah. I agree with that. It's more fun. You can have more fun

525
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:38,870
Speaker 27:  with it. Now.

526
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,810
Speaker 26:  I would say also the dynamic island is not customizable at all. It

527
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,510
Speaker 26:  is the appearance of customizability, but apple is

528
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,550
Speaker 26:  deciding what happens in that island.

529
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I was actually gonna ask about this because we talked about this a

530
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,200
Speaker 2:  few days ago and we're still in this sort of like, who knows what's gonna

531
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,720
Speaker 2:  happen here. And now it's like been a few days. I opened up my phone. I had

532
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,680
Speaker 2:  25 app updates this morning. So it's like, everybody's sort of on the iOS

533
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,920
Speaker 2:  16 train have either of you seen anything that is like dynamic

534
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,770
Speaker 2:  island sparking something cool here. Yeah. Okay.

535
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,530
Speaker 26:  No. Cause the big update is the live activities API, which isn't out yet.

536
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,400
Speaker 26:  So I don't think third party apps will be able to use the island until that

537
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,430
Speaker 26:  API is out.

538
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,200
Speaker 27:  I did the exact sequence of things to get two things in the

539
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,640
Speaker 27:  dynamic island at once. Just like naturally I was

540
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,440
Speaker 27:  listening to a podcast and I set a 15 minute

541
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,160
Speaker 27:  timer to take a COVID test and it was magical for a

542
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,070
Speaker 27:  second. Yeah. But that's as exciting as it gets right now.

543
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,600
Speaker 2:  It's all of our dreams coming true at once. Okay. So this, this feels good.

544
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,640
Speaker 2:  It's, it's more customizable than it once was. But if you switch to Android

545
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,520
Speaker 2:  because it's customizable, stay on Android. I feel like you can make it as

546
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,320
Speaker 2:  ugly as you want was like five years of Samsung ads and it's still, it's

547
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,040
Speaker 2:  still true. But

548
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,760
Speaker 26:  If you switch to Android, cuz you wanted a customize at lock screen and

549
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,160
Speaker 26:  put widgets on the home screen, you know apple, Apple's got you now

550
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,290
Speaker 2:  That's true. Like

551
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:01,120
Speaker 26:  If you wanna change the default messaging app on the iPhone, Android

552
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,080
Speaker 26:  will let you do that. If you wanna add a third party app store to an

553
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,360
Speaker 26:  Android phone, you can do it and apple will not let you do that.

554
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,440
Speaker 2:  Right. All right. Let's move on to the next one. Andrew, what do we have

555
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,620
Speaker 2:  next?

556
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,110
Speaker 29:  Hey guys, this is DS. And one question about the

557
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:19,080
Speaker 29:  iPhone 14. I have been a longtime Android

558
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,000
Speaker 29:  user and I think my friends might actually get to me this year and I may

559
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,920
Speaker 29:  or may not switch to an iPhone, but I don't want to be that guy

560
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,320
Speaker 29:  that gets the iPhone the one year before it goes to type C. Do you think

561
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,120
Speaker 29:  this year is the time to make that call and switch? I really appreciate

562
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,770
Speaker 29:  the input. Thank you.

563
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,640
Speaker 2:  So I just wanna say on one hand, this was a trend of the voicemails that

564
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,520
Speaker 2:  we got from people. This idea that I have been an Android user for a long

565
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,480
Speaker 2:  time. And now I'm tempted back by the iPhone 14, which I

566
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,880
Speaker 2:  find fascinating because I think our takeaway is like, this phone is cool,

567
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,240
Speaker 2:  but it's not gonna like blow your mind out of your head. But there are a

568
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,200
Speaker 2:  lot of people who are like, I have been an Android fan for a

569
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,720
Speaker 2:  long time and maybe now it's time to get back into Android.

570
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,440
Speaker 2:  But USBC is this. The last year is our friend D

571
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,110
Speaker 2:  stupid to buy an iPhone this year. Cause they're gonna switch next year.

572
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,460
Speaker 26:  Well, it depends on where you live because every carrier

573
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,360
Speaker 26:  now it will just give money to you to switch

574
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,000
Speaker 26:  every year.

575
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,730
Speaker 2:  That is true.

576
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,520
Speaker 26:  If you live in the United States, it feels like you can scheme

577
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,120
Speaker 26:  your way into getting a new phone every year for no money. Right. And you're

578
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,920
Speaker 26:  kind of just gonna end up signing a new tier, your contract over and over

579
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,120
Speaker 26:  again. But I like I've come to peace with this idea because when am I gonna

580
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,840
Speaker 26:  not have carrier service?

581
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,760
Speaker 2:  Right.

582
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,600
Speaker 26:  That said it does feel like the USBC change is coming to the phone. I

583
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,550
Speaker 26:  don't know if it's next to your, the year after.

584
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:41,360
Speaker 27:  I think he'd be okay for a while. I don't know. There's still like, there

585
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,240
Speaker 27:  will still be tons of support for lightning many years. They

586
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,800
Speaker 27:  come many, many hotels will have some weird lightning

587
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,470
Speaker 27:  connector, you know, doc to play your

588
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,220
Speaker 27:  phones.

589
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,640
Speaker 26:  But it's the other way around, right? If he was an Android person, he's

590
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,210
Speaker 26:  probably got a bunch of USBC cables.

591
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,510
Speaker 27:  Oh that's true.

592
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,360
Speaker 26:  Buying a bunch of lightning cables for one year seems done. I would

593
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,800
Speaker 26:  wait if that's like, if that's what you're describing, like I'm fully invested

594
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,160
Speaker 26:  in USBC. I'm kind of tempted by this phone, but I'll feel dumb if I

595
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,080
Speaker 26:  buy, you know, a life's worth of cables and then what the next year they

596
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,900
Speaker 26:  go. Yeah, you should wait.

597
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,670
Speaker 2:  The answer is Don. I can't believe we didn't get her yet. The answer is by

598
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,480
Speaker 2:  a bunch of lightning to USBC converters and your life

599
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,120
Speaker 2:  will just be terrific. No, I think that's right. I would wait. But I also,

600
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,760
Speaker 2:  I think you're right NEI that the like, can I buy this year's phone? And

601
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,240
Speaker 2:  also next year's phone is not as hard a question as people

602
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,160
Speaker 2:  think actually, especially in the us where people will just fall all over

603
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,680
Speaker 2:  themselves to give you giant amounts of trade in money

604
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,390
Speaker 2:  for whatever phone you bring them.

605
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,360
Speaker 26:  Yeah. The carrier marketing for the new iPhone is out of control.

606
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,320
Speaker 26:  Like it's wild. Verizon is running ads with celebrities in them being like

607
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,560
Speaker 26:  buy a new iPhone 14. And it's like, everyone knows about the iPhone

608
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,480
Speaker 26:  14. Do you need to hire celebrities to do this? All

609
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,680
Speaker 2:  Right, let's move on. So next one is from John in New York. Andrew, what

610
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,860
Speaker 2:  do we have?

611
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,760
Speaker 29:  Hey verge. This is John from New York. Really love. The show would love

612
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,640
Speaker 29:  to know more about the decision behind the digital SIM seems like the

613
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,260
Speaker 29:  us was the only place that really adopted this. And I wonder what it means

614
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,960
Speaker 29:  for cell phones and global travel. If this is going to be the

615
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,920
Speaker 29:  future of mobile usage, it was actually really challenging

616
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,880
Speaker 29:  for me to get my digital Sims started on my iPhone, 14 pro. Really curious

617
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,190
Speaker 29:  to see what you guys would think about it.

618
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,280
Speaker 2:  I like this one because this is also a thing that was kind of floating around

619
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,150
Speaker 2:  the internet all weekend was that people were having trouble activating.

620
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,680
Speaker 2:  I saw a bunch of people who were saying like Verizon was having a hard time

621
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,320
Speaker 2:  with the EIMS in it. It's just a, a lot of questions of like, is this a good

622
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,510
Speaker 2:  idea? Or are we just solving a problem that doesn't exist by like throwing

623
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,360
Speaker 2:  more technology at the problem, Allison, what's your sense of

624
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,310
Speaker 2:  this? Is there. Where are we in the EIM world right now?

625
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:51,080
Speaker 27:  It's weird because I feel like half the people I follow are really into

626
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,760
Speaker 27:  it and think it's pro consumer in the other half are like, I hate

627
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,400
Speaker 27:  ease them with a fiery passion. I had no

628
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,320
Speaker 27:  trouble with it. I don't do a lot of international travel. So it's

629
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,160
Speaker 27:  not really my use case, but I feel like the people who I know who

630
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,020
Speaker 27:  do travel are the ones who are more amped up about ease IM

631
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,000
Speaker 27:  and that it'll make it easier to kind of swap when you get to

632
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,800
Speaker 27:  another country. I don't, I can't speak to it too. Well, I set this phone

633
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,360
Speaker 27:  up in the back of an Uber on the highway and it worked

634
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,320
Speaker 27:  fine.

635
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,920
Speaker 2:  It's a bold strategy. Yeah,

636
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,960
Speaker 27:  It was, it was real exciting. Yeah.

637
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,680
Speaker 26:  I feel like you can, you can describe sort of abstractly the pro-consumer

638
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,640
Speaker 26:  argument, which is, it should be really easy to sign up a phone for a

639
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,190
Speaker 26:  network service and thus compare plans and pricing

640
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,160
Speaker 26:  faster and switch faster. And all of that. If you make all that switching

641
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,760
Speaker 26:  faster and easier, the carriers will have to compete more. Cuz you might

642
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,480
Speaker 26:  switch away from them.

643
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,320
Speaker 2:  It's like switching webpages at that point, essentially rather than switching

644
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,920
Speaker 2:  devices. That's, that's the idea, right? You don't have to go into a store.

645
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,200
Speaker 2:  You just say that one's cheaper. You press a button and you have it. That's

646
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,640
Speaker 2:  how that's supposed

647
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,570
Speaker 26:  To work. But then that kind of runs into reality. Like

648
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,640
Speaker 26:  at least here in the United States, it runs into like pretty brutal reality,

649
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,480
Speaker 26:  pretty fast, which is the reason they could do in the United States is cuz

650
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,200
Speaker 26:  there's only three carriers. So they could get the three main carriers on

651
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,120
Speaker 26:  board. And then every other carrier minus a few regional carriers like cellular

652
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,280
Speaker 26:  or whatever. But every other carrier is basically an MV and O like they're

653
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,800
Speaker 26:  basically just like reselling and most cases T-Mobile service or

654
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,600
Speaker 26:  Verizon service. And so you, you hear like people on like

655
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,040
Speaker 26:  visible had like real problems, but that's, it's still, it's still like

656
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,280
Speaker 26:  a different cut at like Verizon's network. I think. So they're able to do

657
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,440
Speaker 26:  it here cause they only had to make three deals around the world. They can't

658
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,160
Speaker 26:  just, they haven't made all the deals yet. So they still need a physical

659
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,080
Speaker 26:  SIM tray. The other thing that's really weird is that when you go to add

660
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,040
Speaker 26:  an EIM, it doesn't just show you the available networks and let you sign

661
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,960
Speaker 26:  up for them. You need to like scan a Q you need to go get an EIM kit

662
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,680
Speaker 26:  and scan a QR code or at least go to a website and scan a QR code, which

663
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,280
Speaker 26:  is really weird. Cuz the iPad works as you would expect. If you have an

664
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,120
Speaker 26:  iPad and you go to add a cell plan to an iPad, it'll pop up a

665
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,680
Speaker 26:  screen of available data plans. And just like you sign up for one on the

666
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,120
Speaker 26:  iPad. So it's like they're halfway there. But then the brutal

667
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,000
Speaker 26:  reality, the uncompetitive American market is right in front of

668
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,120
Speaker 26:  you. And then the, they haven't like built the rest of the functionality

669
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,010
Speaker 26:  that would make that pro-consumer vibe like work. And then

670
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,733
Speaker 26:  as we just said, like you're locked into a two year contract in the United

671
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:22,040
Speaker 26:  States anyway. So like you're not switching as much. I dunno. Like it's

672
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,400
Speaker 26:  the beginnings of something. I think most people do not interact with their

673
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,560
Speaker 26:  SIM cards at all. But if you could travel internationally and just like

674
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,200
Speaker 26:  open your phone and be like, I've landed in Europe and like hit the button

675
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,760
Speaker 26:  and see all the networks and sign up for the cheapest one for, you know,

676
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,670
Speaker 26:  a month, that would be amazing. They just haven't built any of that yet.

677
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,320
Speaker 2:  I mean, it goes back to the like theoretically pro-consumer argument, right?

678
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,440
Speaker 2:  Where you can like, you can see why somebody thought this was a very good

679
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,140
Speaker 2:  idea. And at the end of this, it's like, okay, this is the intended behavior.

680
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,640
Speaker 2:  But like you were saying, like, this is a lot of work for three carriers

681
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,440
Speaker 2:  in the us with apple who has more leverage in this space than any other

682
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,600
Speaker 2:  company to pull this off, forget going to Europe where there's a million

683
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,320
Speaker 2:  carriers in a million countries with vastly different ideas

684
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,460
Speaker 2:  about how all of this is supposed to work. It just feels like the idea that

685
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,000
Speaker 2:  any company including apple is gonna be able to sort of exert its authority.

686
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,680
Speaker 2:  That way is just like basically non-existent. So then what you have is you

687
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,580
Speaker 2:  have the European phone and you have the American phone and those two things

688
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,040
Speaker 2:  are like borderline interoperable. So if I'm a person who

689
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,960
Speaker 2:  lives in the us, but travels a ton internationally is the move to buy the

690
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,720
Speaker 2:  Europe phone, like is that fly to London, buy a phone there and don't tell

691
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,600
Speaker 2:  anybody, you still have a physical Sam when you're in the us. You'll

692
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,990
Speaker 27:  Miss out on millimeter wave big bummer.

693
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:35,240
Speaker 2:  I feel like I can live with that. Like I'm, I'm good of all the trade offs

694
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,200
Speaker 2:  here. I, I can live without millimeter wave.

695
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,410
Speaker 26:  Well, I think it is just the it's sort of the behavior that matters, right?

696
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,240
Speaker 26:  It sounds like a lot of people fly to Europe and then just buy a burner

697
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,800
Speaker 26:  SIM for a weekend and throw it away and come back. Like that seems to be

698
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,160
Speaker 26:  what people are describing to us. Like I just show up and I buy a SIM card

699
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,080
Speaker 26:  at the airport and I throw it in my phone and I use it until it's done.

700
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,760
Speaker 26:  And then I fly home and the next time I show up and do it again. So there's

701
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,040
Speaker 26:  an answer that is you show up at the airport and instead of buying a physical

702
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,160
Speaker 26:  SIM card, you buy a QR code and you use that till it's done and you walk

703
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,500
Speaker 26:  away. But I think that just has to all get teased out into practice.

704
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,240
Speaker 2:  All right. We have one more before I let you two go and we're then we're

705
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,380
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about the watch. This is not about the phone, but it's about cameras

706
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,560
Speaker 2:  and you two are by T camera nerd. So let's hear the next

707
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,650
Speaker 2:  one.

708
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,640
Speaker 30:  My name is Z. I run the JZ tech YouTube channel and I

709
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,320
Speaker 30:  was wondering what has the apple made a camera? Cause it seems like

710
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,190
Speaker 30:  that would be a really obvious place to put their money into. Like

711
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,050
Speaker 30:  I know like pretty much everyone has a Sony eight sevens S three these days.

712
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:35,880
Speaker 30:  So like why isn't there an apple camera? And thanks

713
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,510
Speaker 30:  for answering my question.

714
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,680
Speaker 2:  I love this question so much because a, I desperately wanna live in a world

715
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,720
Speaker 2:  where everyone has an a seven S like, this is just, this is, these are our

716
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,400
Speaker 2:  people. I love it. The answer is apple does make a camera and it's called

717
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,410
Speaker 2:  the iPhone, right? Like that's, that's just what this is.

718
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,280
Speaker 27:  It is the, is the most popular camera in the country for

719
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:54,770
Speaker 27:  sure.

720
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,720
Speaker 26:  In the world.

721
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,500
Speaker 27:  Probably. Yeah.

722
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,120
Speaker 26:  The question here is why hasn't apple made a mirrorless camera for

723
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,560
Speaker 26:  creators because apple makes a camera, several models of camera. If you

724
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,480
Speaker 26:  think about the iPhone that way, but why haven't they made an awesome camera

725
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,240
Speaker 26:  for creators? Right. And I think like many things with apple,

726
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,120
Speaker 26:  they have probably looked at that market and said, that's not even a

727
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,730
Speaker 26:  10th of the size of AirPods in terms of money. That will, it will make us

728
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,560
Speaker 26:  so no, and those cameras exist. And you know, there's a

729
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,400
Speaker 26:  long history with them and to enter a market like that, you

730
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,240
Speaker 26:  have to commit to creators. And I'm just leading up to saying,

731
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,890
Speaker 26:  have you used final cut pro because Apple's history in that market

732
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,840
Speaker 26:  is actually not one of great success. So I

733
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,760
Speaker 26:  get why you'd want them to do it. On the other hand, I don't

734
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,720
Speaker 26:  know that you want apple making the kinds of aesthetic decisions in

735
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,120
Speaker 26:  that kind of camera that it does in the iPhone. And sure you can shoot in

736
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,040
Speaker 26:  pro. Now you can shoot in ProRes and back off the aesthetic decisions,

737
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,640
Speaker 26:  but it's apple, right? Like they're gonna be on by default. The apple look

738
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,840
Speaker 26:  will be on by default and I'm, I'm not sure that's that

739
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,810
Speaker 26:  philosophy is compatible with that user base.

740
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:05,520
Speaker 27:  If my a seven C put out JPEGs where everybody was

741
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,480
Speaker 27:  orange, like previous iPhones have, I would be so

742
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:09,870
Speaker 27:  pissed.

743
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:13,750
Speaker 26:  Yeah. Like the worst built in light preset of all time. Yeah.

744
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,920
Speaker 26:  Yeah. There's just, there's weirdness there, but I, I get like why does

745
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,040
Speaker 26:  an apple make, just make a great camera is a question that's been asked

746
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,880
Speaker 26:  for years and years and years now. And kind of the answer is it's the market

747
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,950
Speaker 26:  is just not big enough.

748
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,040
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. Yeah. I mean, in, in the last year or so, a lot of

749
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,240
Speaker 2:  people have been talking about wanting apple to make a webcam again, because

750
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,200
Speaker 2:  suddenly the webcam market was hot for, you know, nine months. I do think

751
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,800
Speaker 2:  going super heavy on the camera would be a really fun future for the iPod

752
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,480
Speaker 2:  touch that they're just like, this is our cheaper camera. It doesn't have

753
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,760
Speaker 2:  all the other cool stuff, but we put the best camera in it.

754
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,730
Speaker 26:  Do they even still make the iPod touch?

755
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,840
Speaker 2:  No, I don't think so. If I'm being completely honest with you, I forgot.

756
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,480
Speaker 2:  Which is sort of the point, right? This is

757
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,040
Speaker 27:  Bring

758
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,060
Speaker 2:  It back. The, the iPod camera, just to confuse everybody

759
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,510
Speaker 27:  Pro max,

760
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,600
Speaker 2:  It's an 11 inch. It's just a television with a camera on the back.

761
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,400
Speaker 27:  Yes.

762
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,040
Speaker 2:  Thank you both. We're gonna talk about the, watch it and bring on V, which

763
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,720
Speaker 2:  means you both have to go, but thank you both. Appreciate it. Thanks.

764
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,110
Speaker 27:  Thank you

765
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,820
Speaker 2:  V. Hello? Hello. Thank you for being here. No problem.

766
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,040
Speaker 2:  All right. We have a bunch of watch questions. People have a lot of feelings

767
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,680
Speaker 2:  about watches so we're just gonna go through a couple of them. Andrew, you

768
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,250
Speaker 2:  wanna play the first one for us?

769
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:27,040
Speaker 31:  Hi, Vergecast Derek here from New Zealand. So I

770
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,770
Speaker 31:  charge my apple watch in my car, on my commute

771
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,660
Speaker 31:  so that it's charged all day. And then it's charged at night for sleep tracking.

772
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,360
Speaker 31:  But if I have to wear my apple watch for the crash

773
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,390
Speaker 31:  detection to work, I mean,

774
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,920
Speaker 31:  what,

775
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,200
Speaker 2:  We're gonna actually answer this question, but I just have two things I have

776
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,840
Speaker 2:  to say before we do one, the official pronunciation of Vergecast is now in

777
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,080
Speaker 2:  a New Zealand accent. So I'd just like everybody to know that. And two, how

778
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,800
Speaker 2:  did I never think about charging my apple watch in the car? It that's a genius

779
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,680
Speaker 2:  plan. It's like the one time it's totally superfluous to my life and

780
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,190
Speaker 2:  I can just charge it. This feels like a good idea, right?

781
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:05,880
Speaker 32:  Yeah, no, it's an excellent idea. I just think, you know, I

782
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,480
Speaker 32:  don't actually commute by car much, so I've just

783
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,960
Speaker 32:  never thought about it cuz you know, I'm in New York city. So when am I

784
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,560
Speaker 32:  gonna like, I don't, I'm not really commuting by car much, but for long

785
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,320
Speaker 32:  trips now I'm just like, oh, because it's totally intuitive to

786
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,640
Speaker 32:  charge your phone in the car, but I've just never thought about charging

787
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,790
Speaker 32:  my watch in the car.

788
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:28,320
Speaker 2:  I know I love this. I'm all in. Okay. But let's, let's talk about the, the

789
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,280
Speaker 2:  crash detection thing here, which is like, I sort of wanted to do this question

790
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,160
Speaker 2:  just because it's representative of a lot of questions we've gotten about

791
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,640
Speaker 2:  like how does crash detection actually work? What is it trying to do? How

792
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,000
Speaker 2:  does it know I'm wearing the watch? How does it know I've been in a crash

793
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,720
Speaker 2:  and I'm assuming the answer to, if you're in the car and you're not wearing

794
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,800
Speaker 2:  the watch and you get in a crash, it probably won't register. I don't know.

795
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,840
Speaker 2:  But what, what do you, what can you tell us about how all of this actually

796
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,570
Speaker 2:  works?

797
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:55,200
Speaker 32:  So I actually asked apple about this earlier today

798
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,000
Speaker 32:  because I also was like, oh, I don't know. I don't know the answer

799
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,760
Speaker 32:  to this, but they basically told me that it was,

800
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,520
Speaker 32:  you know, intended to be worn on the wrist. That doesn't mean it

801
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,280
Speaker 32:  won't necessarily work. It just means like

802
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,210
Speaker 32:  they've done a bunch of testing with like dummies where you're

803
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:18,040
Speaker 32:  putting, you know, the apple watch in various parts of

804
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,400
Speaker 32:  their body and whatnot. So they've done a lot, a lot of testing on this,

805
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,280
Speaker 32:  but it's all on human bodies cuz I think the assumption is if you have

806
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,720
Speaker 32:  the watch on the car, you're probably wearing it. Obviously the rest of

807
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,600
Speaker 32:  us have not gotten on Derek's level and realizing that commuting

808
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,400
Speaker 32:  with the watch. It's like the perfect it's legitimately the perfect time

809
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,050
Speaker 32:  to charge the watch. If you're commuting by car, he gets it. He's

810
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,760
Speaker 32:  on a level that we're not on. So crash detection works because it

811
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,360
Speaker 32:  has a new accelerometer that can detect up to

812
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,240
Speaker 32:  256 GS. The previous watches could only detect up

813
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,120
Speaker 32:  to 32. So that's like orders of magnitudes different. And

814
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,840
Speaker 32:  it also has an improved gyroscope and all of these things are working with

815
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,720
Speaker 32:  the barometer GPS. And I think the

816
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,640
Speaker 32:  microphone to detect whether you've been in a, in a severe car crash, but

817
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,480
Speaker 32:  it's, it's a really fascinating feature because it does seem like

818
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,080
Speaker 32:  Apple's thought really hard about it in terms of how the

819
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,000
Speaker 32:  watch interacts with your phone. So like if

820
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,960
Speaker 32:  you crash the car and you know, you have your phone and your watch

821
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,010
Speaker 32:  on you, it'll route the call through your phone cuz it's got the better

822
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:28,720
Speaker 32:  antenna, but it's gonna gonna appear on your watch because

823
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,160
Speaker 32:  that's more likely to be on you and you don't know where the phone is

824
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,640
Speaker 32:  during your, you know, like in the aftermath of crash, you have no idea

825
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,480
Speaker 32:  where that might have gone. So it's, they've thought a lot about

826
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,440
Speaker 32:  it. It's just, I don't think we really know how it's gonna

827
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,200
Speaker 32:  work until unfortunately people get themselves in

828
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,040
Speaker 32:  that situation. Like I've been in really bad lift rides where

829
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,520
Speaker 32:  it was so stop and go. I felt like I was gonna hurt. Yeah. But that

830
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,400
Speaker 32:  doesn't actually trigger it. And New York drivers or New York drivers and

831
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,680
Speaker 32:  I went hiking this weekend. So there were a couple of close calls, but no

832
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,720
Speaker 32:  actual like trigger. Right?

833
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I would. The part of it that gives me hope like instinctively,

834
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,520
Speaker 2:  it seems like it would make sense that if it wasn't on your body, it wouldn't

835
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,680
Speaker 2:  be looking for that stuff just because it's like, why would it be sort of

836
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,400
Speaker 2:  operating if it, if you weren't wearing it. But then I think about the fact

837
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,040
Speaker 2:  that the iPhone 14 now has crash detection and it's clearly

838
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,040
Speaker 2:  not meant to be worn on your body. So it is like you're saying able to do

839
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,640
Speaker 2:  some of this sensing even when it's not on

840
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,480
Speaker 2:  your body and the apple watch might be treating it differently, but it at

841
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,160
Speaker 2:  least seems like technically it's possible for this stuff to work. Even

842
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,000
Speaker 2:  when the device is not physically like being on your body,

843
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,910
Speaker 2:  watching you like thrash around in the back seat.

844
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,600
Speaker 32:  Yeah. So it's designed to detect like extreme impact and

845
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,520
Speaker 32:  changes in speed. So you have to really hit a certain

846
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,320
Speaker 32:  threshold for that to, to really kind of trigger it's in

847
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,960
Speaker 32:  quote unquote testing, cuz I can't really test it in an

848
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,840
Speaker 32:  ethical way that doesn't risk my life. At least we haven't

849
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,560
Speaker 32:  figured that out just yet. You know, in testing this it's very,

850
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,440
Speaker 32:  it reminded me a lot of testing fall detection. So like back when fall

851
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,260
Speaker 32:  detection was a thing myself and a bunch of other reviewers would just,

852
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,240
Speaker 32:  you know, leap off a bed into a bunch of pillows to

853
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,800
Speaker 32:  see if we could trigger it. And I have yet to trigger it in real life. I've

854
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,570
Speaker 32:  eaten it while running as well, but I wasn't injured enough to

855
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,450
Speaker 32:  be lying their prone, which is part of like the fall detection works.

856
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:28,280
Speaker 32:  So I think you're not really gonna get false

857
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,770
Speaker 32:  positives, which is, you know, which is a big thing. Some, some other

858
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:35,640
Speaker 32:  similar safety features like garments fall detection. You

859
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,480
Speaker 32:  could just have a really hard stop and your loved ones are gonna be told

860
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,440
Speaker 32:  you've had an incident. So I have hope because it sounds like

861
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,970
Speaker 32:  it's very sensitive and I haven't triggered it yet with my terrible driving.

862
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:47,560
Speaker 32:  So there you

863
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,480
Speaker 2:  Go. It's for the best. Yeah. If you, if you have been in a car crash and

864
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,080
Speaker 2:  you have gotten crash detection, call the hotline and tell us about it because

865
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,940
Speaker 2:  I, I am very curious, do not crash your car on purpose to do this,

866
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,280
Speaker 2:  but if it has happened to you, we we'd love to hear about it. All right.

867
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,920
Speaker 2:  Let's move on to the next question we have Andrew, you wanna play it for

868
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,140
Speaker 2:  us?

869
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,840
Speaker 33:  Hey guys. Just wondering if it's really worth

870
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,620
Speaker 33:  getting here is a for the se basically

871
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,520
Speaker 33:  for the always on display. Cause I don't know if I really need

872
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,350
Speaker 33:  the other sensors. Thanks.

873
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:24,000
Speaker 32:  Okay. So don't get the se that doesn't have an always on display. So

874
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,960
Speaker 32:  that's one of the things, things about the se you're missing some of the

875
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,600
Speaker 32:  advanced sensors and the always on display. That's why it could be cheaper

876
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,520
Speaker 32:  than the other watches. But I used to just very, gung-ho say

877
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,240
Speaker 32:  that everyone should just be getting the apple watch se because

878
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,200
Speaker 32:  you know, I wasn't 100% sold on the need for an always

879
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,960
Speaker 32:  on display, but after a few years, I really do like

880
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,880
Speaker 32:  it. I, I think it's an excellent feature. It makes it more

881
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,600
Speaker 32:  like an actual watch in that you can always see the time. And the other

882
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,470
Speaker 32:  thing about it is it's just so much easier

883
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:01,360
Speaker 32:  when you're in a workout because like when I'm running and I wanna

884
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,160
Speaker 32:  check a certain metric or like this weekend when I was on a hike and I wanna

885
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,040
Speaker 32:  see the compass, you can, you can look down and glance at certain

886
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,120
Speaker 32:  things. It's not going to be, it's refreshing at a much slower rate. So

887
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,520
Speaker 32:  you're not gonna see some detail, but you don't necessarily have to bring

888
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,240
Speaker 32:  your wrist up and flick it in just the right way to see the things that

889
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,150
Speaker 32:  you need. It wakes up like a half second faster and it

890
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:26,860
Speaker 32:  it's like not necessary, but it's super nice. It's like

891
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,110
Speaker 32:  now I'm a team always on display.

892
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:33,080
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I always have been. And I honestly think even since the

893
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,800
Speaker 2:  first one, like it it's, it's not a watch. If it doesn't show you the time

894
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,590
Speaker 2:  like that, it just, that's just the rules and apple still has not

895
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:44,520
Speaker 2:  solved that arm gesture. You're talking about like, if I just sort

896
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,960
Speaker 2:  of like flick my wrist over the screen, doesn't turn on. You still have to

897
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,760
Speaker 2:  do this. Like very exaggerated, like bring your arm up to your face.

898
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,280
Speaker 2:  And if you have to do that every time you wanna look at your watch, that

899
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,200
Speaker 2:  is bad to me. It's like always on screen or

900
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,390
Speaker 2:  don't get an apple watch. Like I genuinely believe that.

901
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:05,110
Speaker 32:  Yeah. Well, you know, when you've been in the wearables game, as

902
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:08,800
Speaker 32:  long as I have you, you kind of master the

903
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,480
Speaker 32:  flick. Like I, I get the flick every single time. It

904
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,200
Speaker 32:  almost never not, you know, wakes up in what I needed to, but

905
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,810
Speaker 32:  this is just like five, six years of having to do this. The muscle memory

906
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:23,350
Speaker 32:  is, is there. So if he's upgrading from the series

907
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:27,320
Speaker 32:  four or earlier, you know, and you don't need the other

908
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,910
Speaker 32:  sensors, I think it's totally fine to just go for the se because

909
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,590
Speaker 32:  you've never had the always on display. You don't know what you're missing.

910
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:38,560
Speaker 32:  I went from the apple watch series five to the se when I

911
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,520
Speaker 32:  was testing and I knew what I was missing that made me so happy to

912
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,320
Speaker 32:  go back to the watches with the always on display after. So if you

913
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,720
Speaker 32:  don't know what you're missing and it really is something where you're prioritizing

914
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,310
Speaker 32:  budget, you know, you can't miss what you don't know. So that's one thing

915
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:56,280
Speaker 2:  That's fair. But then back to the question, what they're saying is like,

916
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,880
Speaker 2:  if the always on display isn't enough, is it worth upgrading? And in that

917
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,130
Speaker 2:  case, I feel like the answer's probably not right. Like there's nothing.

918
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:05,890
Speaker 2:  So sort of dramatically spectacularly better

919
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,240
Speaker 2:  in these that if you're happy with the one that you have, you should upgrade,

920
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,750
Speaker 2:  right.

921
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,680
Speaker 32:  Definitely for the series four or later, I think if you

922
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,640
Speaker 32:  have a series three it's time, it's time to put this watch to rest. It's

923
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,460
Speaker 32:  five years old, which, you know, in terms of gadgets, that's ancient,

924
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,400
Speaker 32:  but there are some things where I actually do think the

925
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,240
Speaker 32:  software is worth upgrading for. It just depends on your individual use

926
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,520
Speaker 32:  case. So the new redesigned compass app is

927
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,390
Speaker 32:  bomb. I love it. It is so good. It is finally

928
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:40,320
Speaker 32:  really useful for hikers or like trail runners in a way that

929
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,760
Speaker 32:  like, it was just a compass before. And you're like, cool. I have no idea

930
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,680
Speaker 32:  what a bearing means. Like this doesn't help me. I'm terrible with

931
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,050
Speaker 32:  directions. I like, it's just really sad, but this was a major

932
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:54,880
Speaker 32:  upgrade. The thing is, is that the redesign compass app isn't coming to

933
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,480
Speaker 32:  the series four, you'll get it on the series five, but it's not gonna have

934
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,320
Speaker 32:  the really nifty stuff, like backtrack or way points. So if you

935
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,150
Speaker 32:  do want that stuff and you think it'll be useful for your life,

936
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:09,850
Speaker 32:  you're gonna need to get at least a series six, the first gen

937
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:13,810
Speaker 32:  se or later. So, you know, that's one thing where if you're

938
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,280
Speaker 32:  an outdoors person and you really like that stuff, it's definitely one thing

939
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,560
Speaker 32:  where I think actually, yeah, that is worth upgrading for

940
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,200
Speaker 32:  you. If you stay inside all the time. Nah,

941
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,360
Speaker 32:  you're good. Don't, don't worry about it.

942
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,320
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. That is good advice right there. All right. Thank you to everybody
