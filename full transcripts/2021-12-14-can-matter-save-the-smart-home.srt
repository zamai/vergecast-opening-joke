00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,350
Speaker 1:  I would like to play a game with you playing a game on a podcast is a little

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,130
Speaker 1:  tricky. So we're going to keep it simple. I'm just going to list a bunch

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,820
Speaker 1:  of terms related to the smart home. And I want you to keep track of how

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,270
Speaker 1:  many you recognize then when we're done, we might have like a one question

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,570
Speaker 1:  bonus round. Okay. Are you ready? Here we go. ZigBee

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,500
Speaker 1:  Z-Wave 8 0 2 dot 15 dot four, six L

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,130
Speaker 1:  O w P a N. Thread weave, Bluetooth,

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,210
Speaker 1:  Bluetooth, low energy, wifi bridge, smart things. Alexa, home

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,020
Speaker 1:  assistant, Google home and home kit. Okay. Did you keep track

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,690
Speaker 1:  there? Did you got your score? Feel free to jump back and listen again, if

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,620
Speaker 1:  you need to. Now here's the bonus round question. Do you think

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,130
Speaker 1:  the number of smart home terms that you need to know is going to get

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,320
Speaker 1:  bigger or smaller in the future?

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,840
Speaker 1:  If there's any single category of technology that has been absolutely a

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,710
Speaker 1:  wash in too many different standards, protocols, radios,

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,580
Speaker 1:  and software stacks. It is the smart home 10

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,030
Speaker 1:  years ago, having smart switches or bulbs in your house was the domain of

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,570
Speaker 1:  the very rich or the very nerdy, the kind of people who would get

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,500
Speaker 1:  Crestron systems installed in their house by professionals. But now

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,340
Speaker 1:  thanks in large part to the echo and the smart speakers that followed

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,300
Speaker 1:  there has been a huge explosion in smart home gadgets, and it's gotten

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,870
Speaker 1:  way easier to install and use them, but all that smart home

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,860
Speaker 1:  pass brought a lot of baggage into our smart home present. And so

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,920
Speaker 1:  the question is how much of that are we going to have to carry into our smart

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,880
Speaker 1:  home future? Weirdly enough, there might be an actual answer

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,780
Speaker 1:  to that question. It's another standard to add to that list of terms,

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,740
Speaker 1:  but this time it might mean that you can forget about all of the

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,730
Speaker 1:  rest of them instead of your number, getting bigger. It could get smaller,

30
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,960
Speaker 1:  maybe even down to just one term that you need to know when you buy

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,890
Speaker 1:  a smart home gadget. I am Dieter Bohn, and this week on our

32

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,500
Speaker 1:  finally make this whole ecosystem less complicated.

Speaker 1:  opportunities open to you.

55
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,890
Speaker 1:  Okay. So what is matter? Well, we asked a bunch of

56
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,310
Speaker 1:  experts starting with the connective standards Alliance or

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,390
Speaker 1:  CSA, or you might know them as the standards, body formerly known as the

58
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,380
Speaker 1:  ZigBee Alliance, or, you know, all you really need to know is that

59
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,710
Speaker 1:  it is the group that's in charge of the new matter standard

60
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,440
Speaker 5:  Michelle Mandela Freeman. And I am the head of marketing for the

61
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,560
Speaker 5:  connectivity standards Alliance matter is a

62
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,070
Speaker 5:  breakthrough standard spaced protocol that

63
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,740
Speaker 5:  will transform the internet of things.

64
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,060
Speaker 1:  We also talked to Eve, a company that makes smart home gadgets with a

65
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,910
Speaker 1:  special focus on compatibility with Apple's home kit.

66
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,020
Speaker 6:  The from Eve brand manager and product manager matter is

67
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,980
Speaker 6:  basically the unifying standard that will really take

68
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,950
Speaker 6:  the SmartHome mainstream and get rid of all the

69
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,730
Speaker 6:  fragmentation and problems that have plagued the smartphone

70
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,590
Speaker 6:  industry for the past decades.

71
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,850
Speaker 1:  Okay. There's one more answer to go from Samsung smart things, but I

72
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,520
Speaker 1:  bet you're starting to see a theme here. I'm Samantha

73
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,240
Speaker 7:  And I'm VP of marketing and business development at Samsung SmartThings,

74
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,350
Speaker 7:  I would say matter is the open and universal connected home

75
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,290
Speaker 7:  protocol that makes life easier for developers and consumers.

76
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,410
Speaker 1:  That is a lot of positivity and hype isn't it, but I bet you're not

77
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,740
Speaker 1:  surprised to hear so much positivity and hype from the people that are in

78
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,280
Speaker 1:  charge of the new standard. What are the things that none of those answers

79
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,210
Speaker 1:  actually do though, is tell you what matter actually is. So let's

80
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:57,900
Speaker 1:  give that a shot

81
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,930
Speaker 1:  matter is the language that smart home gadgets are going to use to

82
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,870
Speaker 1:  communicate with each other. So you don't have to worry about whether or

83
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,660
Speaker 1:  not the thing that you buy will be compatible with the other stuff in your

84
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,650
Speaker 1:  house. See, when you have a smart home gadget, there's a few things

85
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,580
Speaker 1:  that need to happen. Here's how it used to work. You need the gadget itself.

86
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,540
Speaker 1:  It needs a radio to communicate like wifi or ZigBee. And

87
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,470
Speaker 1:  sometimes that means it also needs a custom bridge, like say for hue lights

88
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,130
Speaker 1:  or something. You need a language to communicate with like the home kit

89
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,060
Speaker 1:  SDK or the Alexa SDK. And you need to control it all with

90
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,780
Speaker 1:  something like Siri or Alexa or a Google home. Now, if you

91
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,530
Speaker 1:  look at that system of things that you need to make a smart home gadget

92
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,800
Speaker 1:  work, there are just too many places where things might not be

93
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,580
Speaker 1:  compatible. What matter does is standardize the language between

94
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,210
Speaker 1:  all of these different parts of the system. It's agnostic with regards to

95
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,930
Speaker 1:  the kinds of radios you're using. So it'll support wifi, Bluetooth, Bluetooth,

96
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,430
Speaker 1:  little energy, or thread. It means that no matter what kind of

97
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,730
Speaker 1:  controller you use, the steps are connecting and communicating with your

98
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,540
Speaker 1:  gadgets are the same. And eventually it might mean that you

99
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,530
Speaker 1:  won't need any more custom radio bridges plus matter helps

100
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,430
Speaker 1:  to find what things are. So the language knows the difference between a light

101
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,150
Speaker 1:  bulb and a smart lock matter is going to be released in the middle of

102
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,840
Speaker 1:  2022. If everything goes to plan and it'll include a spec that

103
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,350
Speaker 1:  developers can use, plus there should be a whole bunch of new devices that

104
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,660
Speaker 1:  officially support it released around the same time.

105
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,200
Speaker 1:  So that's hopefully not too inaccurate description of matter, but

106
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,100
Speaker 1:  to check my work, I wanted to check with our resident smart home guru. That

107
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,280
Speaker 1:  would be Jennifer Patterson to eat the smart home reviewer at the verge.

108
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,160
Speaker 1:  I figured that we should actually talk to somebody who can tell us just how

109
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,110
Speaker 1:  real this hype actually is

110
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,670
Speaker 8:  Going to get really short and sweet here. Matter means you can

111
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,390
Speaker 8:  buy what you want for your smart home. You can plug it in

112
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,410
Speaker 8:  and it will work with everything else in your home. Okay.

113
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,870
Speaker 8:  You don't believe me.

114
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,360
Speaker 1:  No, I don't. Well, so this is everyone. Everyone has basically the same.

115
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,420
Speaker 1:  Like everything's going to be wonderful and perfect in the future with matter

116
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,450
Speaker 1:  thing, like the hype is very real at this thing. So the second question I'm

117
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,290
Speaker 1:  asking everybody is like, what are the odds expressed as a percentage that

118
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,490
Speaker 1:  this will actually work?

119
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,780
Speaker 8:  Yes. Well, that's a good follow up question because the odds are still to

120
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,290
Speaker 8:  me up in the air. I'm not a betting girl. So can I say like

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,310
Speaker 8:  80% chance? I would say there's an 80%

122
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,610
Speaker 8:  chance. Now when I first started reporting on matter, I was thinking, this

123
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,450
Speaker 8:  is like a 40 to 50% chance, but I have been steadily

124
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,140
Speaker 8:  increasing my confidence as I've covered this space because you know, the

125
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,860
Speaker 8:  key here is we've got all the big players on board and as

126
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,430
Speaker 8:  one executive explained it to me, it's a lot like the beginning of the internet,

127
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,000
Speaker 8:  you know, when we had to choose between AOL and CompuServe and MindSpring,

128
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,900
Speaker 8:  I don't actually remember all of that, thankfully, but it's, it's like

129
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,260
Speaker 8:  that, but now we've got them all talking so we don't need to choose. We're

130
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,250
Speaker 8:  getting them to work together. And then that will provide us a strong

131
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,540
Speaker 8:  platform to move forward from

132
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,200
Speaker 1:  The thing that has struck me in talking to a bunch of people about batter

133
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,220
Speaker 1:  is just how hyped it is. Just how much everybody

134
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,580
Speaker 1:  seems to believe that's involved in it. Of course, normally when there's

135
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,060
Speaker 1:  a standards group, it's well, we'll see we're working together. We have high

136
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,340
Speaker 1:  hopes, whatever, but this one is like, we're going to fix it. It's going

137
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,180
Speaker 1:  to be great. And I'm wondering if you could just, you've been reporting on

138
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,750
Speaker 1:  smart home stuff for a very long time. You understand the fragmentation better

139
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,440
Speaker 1:  than anybody. Can you put in context how

140
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,310
Speaker 1:  bad the state of smart home is now and why we need

141
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,440
Speaker 1:  something like matter next year,

142
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,210
Speaker 8:  This is the key to why this could be successful because this isn't really

143
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,810
Speaker 8:  designed for the consumer matter is really

144
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,350
Speaker 8:  for the developer. Because I think all of the big

145
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,370
Speaker 8:  companies in the space who have platforms and ecosystems are getting

146
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,480
Speaker 8:  bombarded by developers and manufacturers saying we

147
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,910
Speaker 8:  can't develop seven different things, seven different

148
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,780
Speaker 8:  specs. It's really hard to develop for Alexa and to

149
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,620
Speaker 8:  develop for Siri and to develop for home kitten, to develop for Google and

150
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,580
Speaker 8:  develop for Samsung and, and choose whether we should do ZigBee and Z-Wave.

151
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,670
Speaker 8:  And whether we have a bridge or a herb. And this means we're spending all

152
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,480
Speaker 8:  our time on those things and not on actually developing our core

153
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,320
Speaker 8:  product and get making better features. And so I think that's why

154
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,680
Speaker 8:  these companies have really come together because they need products for

155
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,550
Speaker 8:  their platforms. Very few of them actually make a lot of products for

156
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,180
Speaker 8:  their platforms. They need developers and they need these products. That's

157
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,020
Speaker 8:  where I think the promise of matter is, is it's helping it, make it easier

158
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,650
Speaker 8:  for manufacturers to make these things as well as being

159
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,280
Speaker 8:  useful for the end user, to not having to choose between platforms.

160
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,140
Speaker 1:  What are those developers is Tim boot from Eve now Eve

161
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,110
Speaker 1:  makes smart home gadgets. And as I mentioned earlier, when I introduced them,

162
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,890
Speaker 1:  they mostly focused on working with home kit. But when matter launches,

163
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,520
Speaker 1:  suddenly Eve is going to have a lot more potential customers.

164
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,320
Speaker 1:  So you can see why Tim likes it,

165
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,550
Speaker 6:  Like initially with SmartHome, that there wasn't really any

166
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,510
Speaker 6:  standards to, to work on and any common platforms.

167
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,290
Speaker 6:  So what companies started to do is just build their own

168
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,530
Speaker 6:  ecosystem and built their own little island of

169
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,400
Speaker 6:  things. And then very quickly it became apparent that having

170
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,000
Speaker 6:  little islands everywhere didn't work out. So you would have this awesome

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,810
Speaker 6:  new startup with a new product, and it wouldn't work with your

172
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,620
Speaker 6:  specific islands. And all of that changed about five or

173
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,520
Speaker 6:  six years ago when, when the big players came into the fields. So

174
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,470
Speaker 6:  you now have a very dominant landscape of,

175
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,410
Speaker 6:  of a few big ecosystem providers, but still if as a, as a

176
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,340
Speaker 6:  normal customer, you walk into a store, you can't be certain, the

177
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,850
Speaker 6:  stuff works together in the fashion you wanted to. And if you're

178
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,480
Speaker 6:  invested in one ecosystem that maybe doesn't have a smart

179
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,260
Speaker 6:  display, but you really want to have a smart display in your kitchen. It's

180
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,190
Speaker 6:  a pain to get that working together. And what all of that led to is

181
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,030
Speaker 6:  that people just don't like buying these kinds of things because

182
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,750
Speaker 6:  they just don't want to have the pain. And I think the next big

183
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,440
Speaker 6:  step is just removing all of that pain. And then an average

184
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,100
Speaker 6:  consumer can actually go into the store and buy it and be confident.

185
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,620
Speaker 1:  That all sounds nice, doesn't it? But how does all of this actually work?

186
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,660
Speaker 1:  Let's get back to my conversation with Jennifer.

187
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,390
Speaker 1:  Here's a question that is harder to answer. Is it good? Will it

188
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,110
Speaker 1:  work? Is it a, is it like the right solution? Is it a good from a

189
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,360
Speaker 1:  technical perspective? Well,

190
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,190
Speaker 8:  Do you think wifi is good

191
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,850
Speaker 1:  Where I am in my house?

192
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,530
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So I mean, it is matter, works on wifi and thread. The

193
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,920
Speaker 8:  important thing to remember is this is a technology. This is not a platform

194
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,760
Speaker 8:  or an ecosystem, right? So how well it works on an

195
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,520
Speaker 8:  infrastructure level. I think we can feel quite confident that it is good

196
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,390
Speaker 8:  because it's been developed and tested over a long period of time. We're

197
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,350
Speaker 8:  using two very well-known protocols. Wi-Fi much more known

198
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,590
Speaker 8:  well-known and thread, which has actually been around for a very long time.

199
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,430
Speaker 8:  Even if it hasn't been out in the wild for that long or the broader

200
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,120
Speaker 8:  smart home. So, you know, these are tried and tested protocols. They're not

201
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,390
Speaker 8:  something brand new. They have reinvented the wheel here. So yes, I feel

202
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,780
Speaker 8:  like the actual underlying technology is going to be

203
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,410
Speaker 8:  reliable and work well. It is going to rely somewhat on

204
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,370
Speaker 8:  mesh and, you know, hence I mentioned, wifi mesh can be unstable

205
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,790
Speaker 8:  depending on how well you've got your setup. That's why you're going to need

206
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,510
Speaker 8:  these thread border routers, which will help extend

207
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,320
Speaker 8:  your mesh network if you have a larger home. But the great thing about thread

208
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,070
Speaker 8:  border routers is that they're not white boxes. You have to stick around

209
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,400
Speaker 8:  your house, the lighting, the

210
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,880
Speaker 8:  TVs, the smart speaker. So things you're probably already going to have in

211
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,730
Speaker 8:  your home, right? So you're not going to have a single point of failure for

212
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,910
Speaker 8:  your smart home, which often is the case. Now like someone unplugged your

213
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,750
Speaker 8:  apple TV by mistake, and none of your HomeKit automations work anymore. You

214
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,440
Speaker 8:  know, those types of things are frustrating and that should go away with

215
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,830
Speaker 8:  matter.

216
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,580
Speaker 1:  I want to zero in on the point, Jennifer just made there the potential end

217
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,510
Speaker 1:  of having to use extra hubs to connect up your smart home gadgets.

218
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,740
Speaker 1:  I am very excited to ditch my hubs and hopefully have

219
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,520
Speaker 1:  them be replaced with things that are more than just smart home hubs. So

220
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,390
Speaker 1:  my router or my echo, or my apple TV could work as a

221
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,380
Speaker 1:  matter hub, but it's actually going to be more than that. Jennifer mentioned

222
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,310
Speaker 1:  thread border routers. Basically every device on the network can be a

223
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,940
Speaker 1:  redundant node in the mesh network. That all sounds really

224
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,870
Speaker 1:  technical, but the result is that you shouldn't have to think about it because

225
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,650
Speaker 1:  just as you start to collect new things in your smart home, they're going

226
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,550
Speaker 1:  to quietly improve your smart home network without you having to do

227
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,000
Speaker 1:  anything. Samsung smart things seems to be invested in this idea.

228
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,440
Speaker 7:  18 months ago, we announced that smart things would no longer be making first

229
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,130
Speaker 7:  party hardware with a real vision of where could hardware be.

230
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,300
Speaker 7:  I think the life of a having simply the device itself as a hub,

231
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,260
Speaker 7:  and we've moved beyond that. We just announced it SDC a couple of weeks ago

232
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,830
Speaker 7:  that the smart things hub capability would be going in some of our televisions

233
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,250
Speaker 7:  and appliances as well. So you're starting to see that actualize.

234
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,040
Speaker 1:  Now, one reason that matter has the chance to obviate

235
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,030
Speaker 1:  hubs is that a lot of matter devices are going to use this radio standard

236
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,960
Speaker 1:  called thread, which you've heard come up a bunch already. Thread has a

237
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,800
Speaker 1:  long history. We actually talked about it on this podcast a couple of weeks

238
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,640
Speaker 1:  ago in our interview with Eero CEO, Nick Weaver now matter can work

239
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,480
Speaker 1:  over Bluetooth to set devices up and it can use wifi to communicate if they

240
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,230
Speaker 1:  need to. But both of those radios aren't as good for

241
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,440
Speaker 1:  smart home gadget communications as thread is

242
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,650
Speaker 1:  thread and matter are different, but they're complimentary parts of the whole

243
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,920
Speaker 1:  picture here. I asked Michelle at the connective standards Alliance, how

244
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,140
Speaker 1:  thread fits into this entire vision.

245
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,880
Speaker 5:  I do think that some of the reasons we've gone with the core radios

246
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,690
Speaker 5:  that we have for both for wifi and for thread and Bluetooth for

247
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,930
Speaker 5:  commissioning is because they are particularly common and prevalent.

248
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,400
Speaker 5:  I would say why first and foremost is dare I say, virtually

249
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,090
Speaker 5:  ubiquitous these days in terms of being able to, to support that

250
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,510
Speaker 5:  connectivity, Bluetooth through a commissioning and provisioning perspective

251
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,110
Speaker 5:  is something that's fairly ubiquitous. And I think what Fred

252
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,950
Speaker 5:  brings is that kind of in-home mesh networking technology,

253
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,760
Speaker 5:  IP based mesh networking. That really helps with

254
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,660
Speaker 5:  those types of connected in the home situations. So we

255
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,650
Speaker 5:  believe that this, I guess starter kit of physical layers is a good

256
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,400
Speaker 5:  package of physical layers for our members and consumers

257
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,380
Speaker 5:  to, to get the most out of what matters,

258
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,460
Speaker 1:  Right? Thread is one of those things that actually matter to where

259
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,510
Speaker 1:  I have this split in my brain of, it seems like it's taking too long,

260
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,510
Speaker 1:  that it's taken forever, especially with thread, but a little bit with matter.

261
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,990
Speaker 1:  I think the original promises from ship were a little bit sooner than what

262
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,780
Speaker 1:  we're going to be getting here. So I've got that side of my brain and why

263
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,200
Speaker 1:  is it taking so long? And then the other side of my brain understands how

264
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,100
Speaker 1:  standards processes usually go. And it seems like it's moving a

265
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,430
Speaker 1:  lightening quick, from your perspective, do you have that same split or do

266
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,530
Speaker 1:  you see it as on one side or the other?

267
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,420
Speaker 5:  I like that part of your brain

268
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,880
Speaker 5:  that's right. I mean, it is hard work, right? Let's not make bones

269
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,360
Speaker 5:  about that. It is difficult to bring together

270
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,230
Speaker 5:  hundreds of companies and thousands of engineers and cross more than one

271
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,160
Speaker 5:  standard site, by the way. Right? So the CSA is the home for matter.

272
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,090
Speaker 5:  And Fred group and the Wi-Fi Alliance, you know, are the

273
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,990
Speaker 5:  organizations who manage those kinds of physical networking areas. So

274
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,860
Speaker 5:  it is a complex solution to deliver. So

275
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,760
Speaker 5:  in one sense of the word, it's easy to see how a complex situation

276
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,270
Speaker 5:  like that can take a long time. The thing that I always come back to is the

277
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,750
Speaker 5:  fact that we are building something that's quite breakthrough. And I do

278
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,650
Speaker 5:  believe that in the grand scheme of things, we are moving at a very

279
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,190
Speaker 5:  rapid pace relative to what many other standards

280
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,970
Speaker 5:  organizations and standards of the past have done and even more.

281
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,810
Speaker 5:  So the thing to remember about whether you think we're going slow or

282
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,560
Speaker 5:  not, or going fast is we're not just delivering a paper

283
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,130
Speaker 5:  spec. And that I think is part of what makes

284
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,200
Speaker 5:  this work particularly different.

285
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,970
Speaker 1:  Let's get back to my conversation with Jennifer, the verge of smart home

286
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,910
Speaker 1:  reviewer, because she actually could tell us a little bit more about where

287
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,860
Speaker 1:  thread came from in the first place.

288
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,720
Speaker 8:  Okay. So thread came from nest thread came from nest.

289
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,650
Speaker 8:  pre-Google

290
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,040
Speaker 1:  The good nest, the nest one. It made stuff that worked everybody like.

291
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,470
Speaker 8:  So I spoke with Tony Fidel, I'm the founder of nest about this. And

292
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,470
Speaker 8:  he explained, you know, originally when they first put out the first nest

293
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,040
Speaker 8:  learning thermostat it, how does it be radio in because they, they envisioned

294
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,790
Speaker 8:  this future where thermostat would need to talk to more devices in the home.

295
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,020
Speaker 8:  And after a while, they started to realize that the ZigBee didn't

296
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,620
Speaker 8:  really have what they needed. And so they started to work with Silicon

297
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,130
Speaker 8:  labs, which is, who is very much involved in matter to

298
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,880
Speaker 8:  develop something more powerful on top of the ZigBee

299
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,750
Speaker 8:  radio. So it is a ZigBee radio, but it has their software layer

300
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,740
Speaker 8:  on top, which is thread and then matter,

301
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,700
Speaker 8:  which now matter is on top of that, when nest worked on it,

302
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,480
Speaker 8:  they actually had weave, which if you can recall way back

303
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,290
Speaker 8:  when we've was what nest came out with when they introduced

304
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,050
Speaker 8:  thread and they introduced thread and they introduced weave and the entire

305
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,460
Speaker 8:  smart home world went, ha

306
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,710
Speaker 1:  It's like too many metaphors, too many puns. Why would we trust

307
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,460
Speaker 1:  you? Yeah, yeah.

308
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,210
Speaker 8:  What is this even doing? Why do we care? Why do we need another

309
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,750
Speaker 8:  protocol? You know, we've already got 17 that don't work properly and why

310
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,260
Speaker 8:  we got one more. So I think it was an uphill climb. And

311
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,100
Speaker 8:  Tony mentioned that he had a lot of people pretty much laugh in his face

312
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,040
Speaker 8:  and say, this is ridiculous. You shouldn't even bother why are you doing

313
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Speaker 8:  this? And I asked him, why is it now, why now has thread

314
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,750
Speaker 8:  taken off? And he said, his theory is because all of

315
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,380
Speaker 8:  the other smart home companies or ecosystems like Amazon and

316
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,340
Speaker 8:  apple went out and started to try and make products themselves or make systems

317
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,870
Speaker 8:  themselves for consumers. And they started to get all the feedback that nest

318
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,820
Speaker 8:  had been getting, that these things aren't working, we need this, we need

319
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,660
Speaker 8:  that. So they realized, oh, actually we do need something like

320
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,350
Speaker 8:  this. We need this universal protocol that is going to

321
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,010
Speaker 8:  work. Communication is the key in the smart home. Everything needs to talk

322
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,430
Speaker 8:  to everything else. And none of the existing protocols were specifically

323
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,360
Speaker 8:  designed for smart home devices to talk to each other. They all had failure

324
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,540
Speaker 8:  points that made it difficult. And thread fixes all of those.

325
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,340
Speaker 1:  The companies that make smart home gadgets are also excited about thread

326
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,760
Speaker 1:  because it makes their jobs simpler. They can just pick the radio that they

327
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,120
Speaker 1:  know works with everything. Instead of having to bet on an ecosystem like

328
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,940
Speaker 1:  ZigBee or Z-Wave or whatever, here's Tim from Eve

329
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,680
Speaker 6:  Threats, she removes like all of the problems you get

330
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,040
Speaker 6:  with using technologies that are not made for smart

331
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,310
Speaker 6:  devices. We, as a company, we are sort of the

332
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,210
Speaker 6:  minority with having lots of Bluetooth enabled products, because he

333
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,160
Speaker 6:  can't use wifi for like a door and windows

334
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,060
Speaker 6:  sensor that would just drain the battery much quicker than, than

335
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,670
Speaker 6:  anyone would like. So the alternative is to use some other

336
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,300
Speaker 6:  protocol and have a bridge, and we never wanted that. So for

337
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,050
Speaker 6:  us threads really is a no-brainer because you can just

338
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,740
Speaker 6:  use it for everything. It's, it's, it's low power. It creates a mesh

339
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,400
Speaker 6:  network, but, but a unified mesh network that works

340
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,360
Speaker 6:  across different manufacturers. So, so you can have an

341
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,230
Speaker 6:  Eve darned window sensor at your door, and very far away, a home

342
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,990
Speaker 6:  pod mini, and in-between, let's say a non-belief vault

343
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,010
Speaker 6:  and they just extend their network automatically and work together

344
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,790
Speaker 6:  to just create this seamless networking stuff. And I

345
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,780
Speaker 6:  think it aligns perfectly with the matter now, because with this IP

346
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,650
Speaker 6:  based world, you now really have the complete story on the transport

347
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,640
Speaker 6:  level, on the language level application layer that everything

348
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,400
Speaker 6:  just works and it's made with IOT in mind.

349
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,280
Speaker 1:  All right, stepping back a moment. I just have to tell you that right

350
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,820
Speaker 1:  now, I personally am feeling a little bit off

351
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,750
Speaker 1:  kilter. Usually when we talk about MSCI technologies and the

352
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,620
Speaker 1:  standards that are supposed to fix them, we end up talking about the

353
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,190
Speaker 1:  problems, but maybe because matter hasn't launched yet,

354
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,700
Speaker 1:  everybody still seems really excited. And there aren't a whole lot of

355
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,090
Speaker 1:  problems to talk about yet. Plus it is

356
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,990
Speaker 1:  very, very strange to think that apple and

357
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,860
Speaker 1:  Google and Samsung and Amazon are all working

358
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,520
Speaker 1:  together. I asked Michelle at the CSA about it.

359
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,080
Speaker 5:  It is a challenge, right? To get such a diverse group of

360
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,860
Speaker 5:  companies and players with perspective interests together to create this

361
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,400
Speaker 5:  kind of momentum and change. But I genuinely believe kind of the

362
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,970
Speaker 5:  impetus is one, a commitment to consumers and

363
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,690
Speaker 5:  creating consumer value. And to the notion that, you know, there

364
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,290
Speaker 5:  has to be some trade offs along the way, at a point each of these

365
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,040
Speaker 5:  small individual enclaves or each of these unique or individual

366
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,940
Speaker 5:  experiences are going to hit a bit of a market wall, the wall of the

367
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,720
Speaker 5:  walled garden as it were, right. You know, okay, I'm not going to grow

368
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,260
Speaker 5:  anymore. I'm not going to be able to expand beyond these walls. And it could

369
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,770
Speaker 5:  be an ecosystem provider who thinks about that. It could be a device manufacturer

370
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,610
Speaker 5:  who hide their reigns to one of the ecosystems and

371
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,970
Speaker 5:  realize, you know, if I really want to change the market, if I really want

372
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,690
Speaker 5:  to grow to the market, if I really want to get to that next step or that

373
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,680
Speaker 5:  next level, I have to look at places where I collaborate

374
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,280
Speaker 5:  in different ways. I have to find those places where collaboration

375
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,540
Speaker 5:  actually allows the market to grow or the pie

376
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,410
Speaker 5:  to expand or the walled garden to be knocked down. And

377
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,400
Speaker 5:  then everyone will benefit. So as a manufacturer or

378
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,300
Speaker 5:  an ecosystem provider or a chip set vendor, you have to look at the trade

379
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,810
Speaker 5:  off and say is growing the market and increasing value

380
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,680
Speaker 5:  more important than keeping my small piece of the pie hole.

381
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,730
Speaker 5:  And I think that's what enlightened companies are doing and why

382
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,140
Speaker 5:  they're participating in matter.

383
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,270
Speaker 1:  You really don't need to read between the lines much there. Do you, the walled

384
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,900
Speaker 1:  garden strategy of keeping everybody in separate ecosystems has

385
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,680
Speaker 1:  limited growth for each of these individual companies. I asked Jennifer

386
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,690
Speaker 1:  about this weird friendliness to

387
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,430
Speaker 8:  It's consumerism. I mean, they want to sell more products.

388
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,480
Speaker 8:  And the smart home has stagnated. There is a lot of early

389
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,000
Speaker 8:  adoption from early adopters us, but for the

390
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,390
Speaker 8:  masses, that larger consumer market, it's still just too

391
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,230
Speaker 8:  confusing and too complicated. And you know, we go into a

392
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,890
Speaker 8:  home Depot or Lowe's and you buy something and you bring it home and it doesn't

393
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,340
Speaker 8:  work with what you thought it was going to work with. And there was too much

394
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,210
Speaker 8:  confusion. And in order for the market to push forward, I think the big

395
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,080
Speaker 8:  players realized we have to fix this basic issue of what

396
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,070
Speaker 8:  talks to what in the home and how our home, you know, we

397
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,950
Speaker 8:  used to be able to go buy a light bulb and screw it in. And it worked. We

398
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,910
Speaker 8:  need to get back to that stage. We need to be able to buy a light

399
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,660
Speaker 8:  bulb, screw it in. And it should just work with a smart home because that's

400
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,230
Speaker 8:  the future of our homes. Everything is smart. Now our phones, our cars, our

401
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,590
Speaker 8:  TVs, our homes are going to be smart, whether you want them to be or not

402
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,700
Speaker 8:  honestly. So ultimately it's because they're going to sell more

403
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,540
Speaker 8:  products. If they fix this problem, right, there is still going to be plenty

404
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,230
Speaker 8:  of competition because matter is just the communication

405
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,190
Speaker 8:  level features on top of that and ecosystems and how

406
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,000
Speaker 8:  things work, not how they work together, but how they work are still

407
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,390
Speaker 8:  going to be differentiating factors in the smart home that are going to make

408
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,960
Speaker 8:  you choose to buy from one company over the other company.

409
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,910
Speaker 1:  Okay, we're going to take a break. But when we come back, we're going to

410
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,970
Speaker 1:  finish out the rest of our conversation with Jennifer to find out if matter

411
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,960
Speaker 1:  is really going to work and to find out what we can expect for matter. When

412
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,970
Speaker 1:  it comes to security and privacy,

413
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,190
Speaker 3:  This podcast is brought to you by Twilio, for businesses around the

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,550
Speaker 3:  If your snazzy new marketing campaign launches into an empty

422
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,060
Speaker 3:  forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it get any

423
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,750
Speaker 3:  clicks? Here's the thing about advertising. It's totally

424
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,630
Speaker 3:  useless. If you're not reaching people who are ready to engage with your

425
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,530
Speaker 3:  business, that's why more and more B2B marketers are turning to LinkedIn.

467
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,100
Speaker 1:  We are back with our Vergecast Tuesday topic specific episode

468
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,250
Speaker 1:  focused on matter, the new smart home standard,

469
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,890
Speaker 1:  even though everything with matter seems great. There are still a bunch of

470
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,790
Speaker 1:  unanswered questions and technical details that could gum up the

471
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,030
Speaker 1:  works. So let's get to some of those with Jennifer Patterson, Tuohy, the

472
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,500
Speaker 1:  smart home reviewer at the verge.

473
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,240
Speaker 1:  So my understanding is that there's like a base layer of functionality that

474
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,330
Speaker 1:  matter sets it's like we define what the thing is that the light bulb it's

475
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,900
Speaker 1:  a door lock. It's a, you know, whatever it is. And there are certain features

476
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,260
Speaker 1:  that you have to standardize on turning it on and off knowing whether it's

477
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,830
Speaker 1:  on and off, knowing what I don't know, the temperature is or something there's

478
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,610
Speaker 1:  like a set of things like door lock has these components to it. And matter,

479
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,570
Speaker 1:  you have to do that the matter way, but then beyond those features, if you

480
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,480
Speaker 1:  want to do extra stuff, that will still be a thing where different

481
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,320
Speaker 1:  companies are going to be competing on like extra stuff that their ecosystems

482
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,330
Speaker 1:  or gadgets can do. Is that, is that right?

483
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,560
Speaker 8:  That's the plan right now? I mean, that could change, but

484
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,070
Speaker 8:  yes, the software level, like it that's really where companies are going

485
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,980
Speaker 8:  to be able to differentiate is in software because ultimately you're still

486
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,520
Speaker 8:  going to control your home using one or other of these ecosystems.

487
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,630
Speaker 8:  So you're going to pick home kit or Alexa or Google

488
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,870
Speaker 8:  home or Samsung smart things or another one.

489
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,950
Speaker 8:  So they're, they're, they're going to compete on that level from, from the

490
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,850
Speaker 8:  controlled side of things. But then also from the hardware side of things,

491
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,640
Speaker 8:  there are going to be different features, for example, with locks right now,

492
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,210
Speaker 8:  it's just lock and unlock in matter, right. But if you want like the

493
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,630
Speaker 8:  auto unlock, that's a big feature for some devices.

494
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,670
Speaker 8:  That's not part of matter. It may come, there is

495
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,460
Speaker 8:  something called an access control working group in matter, that is looking

496
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,280
Speaker 8:  at developing those types of things. But right now it's just going to be

497
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,820
Speaker 8:  a very simple lock and unlock with a master controller. So

498
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,330
Speaker 8:  there's still going to be different experiences. It's not like suddenly the

499
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,930
Speaker 8:  smart home is just going to be homogenous. It's just that things can communicate

500
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,060
Speaker 8:  with each other. That's really what this is all about.

501
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,500
Speaker 1:  I want another device type and you've actually broken some news on

502
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,400
Speaker 1:  this casting. So I did not realize that

503
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,210
Speaker 1:  the idea that you would be able to get contents playing on a television was

504
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,930
Speaker 1:  going to be part of the spec. So how does this work and can I never have

505
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,760
Speaker 1:  to try and make airplay work again?

506
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,280
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So this is kind of exciting. I, when they met, announced that televisions

507
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,950
Speaker 8:  were going to be in the first matter spec originally, I think everyone just

508
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,610
Speaker 8:  assumed they would be as a controller or a border router, which they

509
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,030
Speaker 8:  still can be. But also, and this is sort of spearheaded by

510
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,930
Speaker 8:  Amazon, most likely because they're the ones that don't have a handheld

511
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,830
Speaker 8:  device that you use every day, but also because fire TV and

512
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,760
Speaker 8:  Amazon Alexa is sort of prime video platform is, is such a

513
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,570
Speaker 8:  core part of their business. The concept here is that assuming you have a

514
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,380
Speaker 8:  matter controller, like your smartphone or a smart speaker, and you

515
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,010
Speaker 8:  have a matter enabled app on your TV, you'll be able to

516
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,730
Speaker 8:  cast. And that's a basic matter spec. So you will be able to

517
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,660
Speaker 8:  send any content from whatever controller you have to your

518
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,170
Speaker 8:  TV, right? You won't need any special casting

519
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,070
Speaker 8:  setup like Chromecast or apple TV airplay, or

520
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,330
Speaker 8:  I don't know what Samsung's is called, but yes, so you won't

521
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,510
Speaker 8:  have to worry about that anymore. Everything should just go from one space

522
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,410
Speaker 8:  to the other seamlessly. And that has been really an area of

523
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,110
Speaker 8:  friction. I think, in the home entertainment right now, it's been really

524
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,680
Speaker 8:  difficult to do, to do that. Well, I know my kids with that

525
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,740
Speaker 8:  Oculus is so upset that we can't watch them on TV cause we can never get

526
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,370
Speaker 8:  it to work properly. So yes, but it will depend on

527
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,360
Speaker 8:  individual apps and manufacturers allowing it and

528
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,530
Speaker 8:  being matter enabled.

529
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,710
Speaker 1:  So this sounds a lot more like the Google cast model, where instead of like,

530
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,640
Speaker 1:  you can do some direct stuff with cast now, but like airplay for a long time

531
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,270
Speaker 1:  up until I play too, was it takes the thing on your screen and directly like

532
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,530
Speaker 1:  sends it wirelessly to the local thing to play. But this is more like

533
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,940
Speaker 1:  you've got a controller you tell the matter app on the TV play this

534
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,660
Speaker 1:  URL. And so that's, that's much more how Google cast works. It's sort of

535
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,380
Speaker 1:  handing off the street URLs for streams than it is directly

536
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,570
Speaker 1:  streaming from the device to the thing.

537
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,900
Speaker 8:  Well, you know, I, I don't know the exact technical details. I do know that

538
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,290
Speaker 8:  you will be able to control more than just casting. So you'll be able to

539
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,270
Speaker 8:  control volume. You'll be able to control inputs and

540
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,790
Speaker 8:  you'll be able to control, you know, pausing and fast-forwarding, and it

541
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,570
Speaker 8:  will be based on your streaming device too. So it can either it can work

542
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,290
Speaker 8:  with a smart TV or a smart streaming device. So in

543
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:27,920
Speaker 8:  theory, you won't need to like use Google Chrome on your

544
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,490
Speaker 8:  phone to cast to a Chromecast if you're using an iPhone, which

545
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,260
Speaker 1:  Would be amazing.

546
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,880
Speaker 8:  Yes. It makes basically making everything easier. That's the

547
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,230
Speaker 8:  ultimate idea here.

548
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,000
Speaker 1:  This discussion is a perfect example of how I feel about matter is like

549
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,450
Speaker 1:  very exciting, very hyped. Everyone's like, yep, everything's just going

550
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,900
Speaker 1:  to work. It's going to be great, but then you stop. And you're like, but

551
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,020
Speaker 1:  hang on. There are some technical questions here that I don't know fully

552
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,740
Speaker 1:  know the answer to. And so I feel unsettled because I kind of

553
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,340
Speaker 1:  believe the hype right now. And that's not a normal thing for me to do with

554
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,210
Speaker 1:  tech. Like help me work through my emotions about like maybe actually

555
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,790
Speaker 1:  thinking that some of this stuff is actually gonna work.

556
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,260
Speaker 8:  I know, I know I'm kind, I'm right there with you. I want to be deeply skeptical,

557
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,160
Speaker 8:  but I also want my smart home to work. So I'm excited about

558
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,850
Speaker 8:  that. I think we should be confident and excited about the basic

559
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,810
Speaker 8:  technology. I don't think we should suddenly think everyone is going

560
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,500
Speaker 8:  to be, if there's all kumbaya and the whole smart home is, is this

561
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,070
Speaker 8:  great space. There's still a lot of big questions. The biggest questions

562
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,760
Speaker 8:  in my mind, a cameras, because that's such a big space in the smart home.

563
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,960
Speaker 8:  And that's still a ways off I'm smart security systems

564
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,650
Speaker 8:  too. We're not really seeing that space. Hasn't really come into the

565
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,370
Speaker 8:  inter matter. There's a lot of areas that are, that are key to our homes

566
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,360
Speaker 8:  that are not here yet. And I'm also a bit worried about companies hedging

567
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,320
Speaker 8:  their bets slightly here. Amazon's just released four or five new

568
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,800
Speaker 8:  products and didn't mention matter at all. Now their

569
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,520
Speaker 8:  argument here is, well, it's very hard to build a

570
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,330
Speaker 8:  product for a spec that does not exist, which is a fair

571
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:05,870
Speaker 8:  point.

572
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:10,580
Speaker 1:  Sure. But I mean, this working group has been around since

573
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,000
Speaker 1:  2019. They like they're deeply involved. They know what the spec is going

574
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,090
Speaker 1:  to be like, devices are getting tested right now for it.

575
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,840
Speaker 8:  Well, but this is the other problem. And this is something that, so Mitch

576
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,650
Speaker 8:  client of the Z-Wave Alliance and said, you know, protocol

577
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,610
Speaker 8:  politics have existed since the smart home began. And the

578
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,150
Speaker 8:  ZigBee Alliance, which is now CSA is all about making people talk to each

579
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,940
Speaker 8:  other. But just because you get people into a room to talk to each other

580
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,670
Speaker 8:  does not mean you end up with an agreement. So we've still got

581
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,940
Speaker 8:  that barrier to, to move through for each different

582
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:46,200
Speaker 8:  part of the smart home that goes through the matter specs. And right now

583
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,590
Speaker 8:  we've got like 10 different devices, but we've got many more that we have

584
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,490
Speaker 8:  to work through and it could take awhile. This is not something that's

585
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,310
Speaker 8:  going to happen overnight, as we can see, cause it's already been delayed

586
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,240
Speaker 8:  substantially.

587
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,770
Speaker 1:  So basically like the more complicated data privacy wise or politically

588
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,380
Speaker 1:  a product category is the longer it might take. So cameras are a perfect

589
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,280
Speaker 1:  example. You mentioned that like ring, it seems to be Mia

590
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,240
Speaker 1:  with regard to matter and the CSA. So I'm sure that ring

591
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,930
Speaker 1:  has a completely different philosophy on what to do with your video data

592
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,720
Speaker 1:  than apple does with HomeKit where they want everything local and they don't

593
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,960
Speaker 1:  even want to know it exists in the first place. Right. So should we just

594
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,920
Speaker 1:  like, we should be assuming that things that like are more complicated

595
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,700
Speaker 1:  are going to take longer or maybe like B become fragmented

596
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,450
Speaker 1:  again with matter.

597
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,480
Speaker 8:  I think things that involve revenue streams, I'm

598
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:38,010
Speaker 8:  going to go into be more complicated. It may not be that the

599
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,820
Speaker 8:  technology is an issue, but figuring out how all of the,

600
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,990
Speaker 8:  you know, how that's going to work in terms of the connection with the consumer

601
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:50,100
Speaker 8:  and the revenue model, you know, we saw it slightly with the HomeKit secure

602
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,940
Speaker 8:  video and some companies kind of half adopting it because they didn't

603
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,840
Speaker 8:  really want to give up back control. Like ALO you can have your

604
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,830
Speaker 8:  HomeKit videos, you can stream through home kit, but you can't have the home

605
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,950
Speaker 8:  kit secure video portion because Arlo still wants you to pay them.

606
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,000
Speaker 8:  I think when it comes to revenue streams, that's where we're going to start

607
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,960
Speaker 8:  seeing some hiccups and that, yes, we may still see some fragmentation there,

608
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,490
Speaker 8:  but hopefully they can figure it out.

609
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,690
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The other hype-y things that I might want to Pierce there's

610
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,320
Speaker 1:  security. So part of matter is like issuing security updates, but you

611
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,170
Speaker 1:  mentioned Z-Wave Alliance. It sounds like they're the one group that's like,

612
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,100
Speaker 1:  ah, I dunno. And they pointed out one possible

613
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,380
Speaker 1:  security concern here. Can you talk about that a little bit?

614
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,430
Speaker 8:  And I'm still, I've reached out to the matter for a little bit more clarification

615
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,670
Speaker 8:  on this or CSA group, but for more clarification on this, but

616
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,780
Speaker 8:  because matter is an IP based standard and the thread and

617
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,740
Speaker 8:  wifi are IP based protocols. In theory, each device can,

618
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,760
Speaker 8:  has an open connection to the internet, which gives you much more. I

619
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,430
Speaker 8:  mean, immediately you're like, oh, the hackers

620
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,870
Speaker 8:  malware.

621
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,020
Speaker 1:  Well, I'm thinking of my printer. And like, you know, like it it's like,

622
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,910
Speaker 1:  Nope, doom that's bad. Okay.

623
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,620
Speaker 8:  So, but they, you know, and with Z-Wave, it's the opposite. That's why you

624
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,340
Speaker 8:  have a hub because everything goes through this one hub and that hub is tightly

625
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,820
Speaker 8:  locked down and secure and that's how most security systems are built. And

626
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,270
Speaker 8:  that's why this, we may have an issue with porting that the

627
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,110
Speaker 8:  CSA said to me that actually, you know, we're, we're trying really hard

628
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:23,070
Speaker 8:  here to work with IP is the future IP based is going to give us so

629
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,970
Speaker 8:  much more flexibility. We can constantly update. We can constantly

630
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,610
Speaker 8:  provide patches, just like we have with our smartphone. You know, you get

631
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,750
Speaker 8:  a patch every week. I have a feeling that will be the case with a matter

632
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,220
Speaker 8:  smart home, you will be doing a lot of updates. Well, you won't have to do

633
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,940
Speaker 8:  it. It should automatically do it. But yes, security is a big concern.

634
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,910
Speaker 8:  Security is going to be a concern going forward. But if you want devices

635
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,810
Speaker 8:  to talk to each other, you have to open those channels. And if you lock

636
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:50,620
Speaker 8:  it down, you're going to lose the communication. So that's the sort of payoff

637
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,590
Speaker 8:  here, the security versus convenience.

638
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,640
Speaker 1:  And if they are genuinely like issuing security updates, that it is genuinely

639
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,820
Speaker 1:  part of the spec, maybe it'll be fine, but that's like definitely a thing

640
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,300
Speaker 1:  to keep an eye on. The other thing for me though, is that when I asked Michelle

641
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,930
Speaker 1:  from the CSA or Samantha from smart things about privacy, their

642
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,530
Speaker 1:  answers were about security. So here's Michelle's response.

643
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,910
Speaker 5:  This is as I'm building those incredibly strong security foundations,

644
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,750
Speaker 5:  making sure every device that tries to join the network can be

645
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,710
Speaker 5:  attested and authenticated. That every message that goes across that home

646
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,550
Speaker 5:  network, you know, using matter is encrypted. That we do support

647
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,240
Speaker 5:  the ability to continue to patch and upgrade. You know, as

648
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,600
Speaker 5:  vulnerabilities are found and resolved, which they will be, that is the world

649
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,590
Speaker 5:  of security that we're able to, to enable that through standards for

650
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:38,830
Speaker 5:  our

651
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,920
Speaker 1:  Members. And here's Samantha's response. One of the things

652
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,580
Speaker 7:  Fundamental charters of matter is privacy and security.

653
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:50,020
Speaker 7:  It is considered pinnacle. And one of the core charters of

654
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,920
Speaker 7:  the protocol, something that is not only discussed, but a commitment from

655
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,940
Speaker 7:  each of these leading companies to ensure that we fulfill that promise.

656
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,690
Speaker 1:  So you can see there, they're like security at the court. We do. And I'm

657
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,440
Speaker 1:  like, okay, but privacy in my data, they're like, yep, we're very

658
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,340
Speaker 1:  secure. And it's like, there's a, there's an Allision there that has me

659
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,970
Speaker 1:  trouble that they're like the matter has nothing to say about what happens

660
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,510
Speaker 1:  with the actual data, other than it can do local control. But that's not

661
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,300
Speaker 1:  a guarantee that it won't get out somehow.

662
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,960
Speaker 8:  Yeah, no. So because really it's privacy, isn't

663
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,980
Speaker 8:  there remit the privacy will still be up down to your

664
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,760
Speaker 8:  relationship with the vendor, right? The privacy is going to be, if you're

665
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,570
Speaker 8:  in an Alexa home, you know, with your relationship with Amazon, if

666
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,440
Speaker 8:  you're in a home kit, home, your relationship with apple, if you buy a

667
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,310
Speaker 8:  device from a no-name brand in China, your relationship with that

668
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,790
Speaker 8:  company, you know, it matter doesn't deal with the software level, which

669
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,480
Speaker 8:  is where the data and the privacy relationship really is going to sit in

670
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,410
Speaker 8:  the smart home. It just deals with the hardware level. Really great. Wonderful.

671
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,240
Speaker 8:  That's why they never answered the question.

672
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,740
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Well, and it's also like, well, they don't know and that yeah.

673
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,440
Speaker 1:  There's no way they could ever get these companies to agree on something

674
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,320
Speaker 1:  like that. It's hard enough to get them to agree on just like basic networking.

675
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,170
Speaker 8:  Right. And also it depends where you live too. So there's going to be very

676
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,920
Speaker 8:  different rules and regulations based on which country you're in

677
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,970
Speaker 8:  or the matter is global. It's not just us. I mean, it is in every country

678
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:16,840
Speaker 8:  almost.

679
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,470
Speaker 1:  Okay. So this thing is supposed to launch next year, but next year is next

680
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,460
Speaker 1:  year. And this year is holiday season and I want to buy the, some

681
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,490
Speaker 1:  smart home gadgets, should I or should.

682
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,990
Speaker 8:  So Matt and CSA will say, go ahead and buy

683
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,310
Speaker 8:  everything. It's all going to fine. Everything's going to upgrade

684
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,750
Speaker 8:  because I don't want everyone to stop buying stuff right now. And

685
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,040
Speaker 8:  to an extent, I think they're right. I mean, enough of these companies

686
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,000
Speaker 8:  have gotten on board and said, we are going to upgrade these

687
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,630
Speaker 8:  things to matter. So, you know, Amazon said all, its Alexa speakers will

688
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,350
Speaker 8:  be matter enabled. We know that there are thread radios in the

689
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,800
Speaker 8:  HomePod minis and there are many devices you can feel comfortable with.

690
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,430
Speaker 8:  There are a few categories I would hold off on as we've already discussed.

691
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,610
Speaker 8:  If your thinking matters the way you want to go with your smart home cameras

692
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,570
Speaker 8:  and security systems for one, anything you already have, you know,

693
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,600
Speaker 8:  that you've had for a long time. And you're thinking about upgrading. I'd

694
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,320
Speaker 8:  wait because there's a chance what you have may still may be

695
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,380
Speaker 8:  upgradable. And if it's not, then wait and find the new one once, you know,

696
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,340
Speaker 8:  for sure what's going to work. It is a difficult time to be making

697
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,240
Speaker 8:  big decisions. But if you're talking like smart speakers, sensors, you

698
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,600
Speaker 8:  know, what's the things that are in the main, the first sort of rollout you

699
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,840
Speaker 8:  should feel pretty comfortable about buying new devices this Christmas.

700
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,220
Speaker 1:  Okay. I completely disagree. I think I said, no. I say it every,

701
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,580
Speaker 1:  every time it comes up, never buy hardware today based on the promise of

702
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,670
Speaker 1:  a software update tomorrow, if you want to buy something because you know

703
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,240
Speaker 1:  it works today and it does what you want today that probably won't break.

704
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,180
Speaker 1:  Once matter comes out, it might not work with the beautiful matter system

705
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,170
Speaker 1:  in the future, but don't, don't just only buy it if

706
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:54,860
Speaker 1:  it works today.

707
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,040
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah, definitely. Don't. I mean, if you want something, if you have a

708
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,910
Speaker 8:  need right now by what's going to work for you today, I totally agree

709
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:02,450
Speaker 8:  with that.

710
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,350
Speaker 1:  So this thing is launching sometime mid 20, 22. What do you think this launch

711
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,170
Speaker 1:  is going to look like? Is it going to be like a press release saying the

712
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,010
Speaker 1:  spec exists, developers can make stuff and there's a nano leaf you can,

713
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,510
Speaker 1:  or is it going to be, here are

714
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,470
Speaker 1:  6,000 smart home gadgets that all work together in a beautiful

715
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,190
Speaker 1:  Columbia future. Bam, go to best buy, get in line. Like what on that

716
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,260
Speaker 1:  spectrum? Where do you think we're going to get

717
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,580
Speaker 8:  Apple iPhone five sale day? Well, it it'll be queuing outside best buy

718
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,500
Speaker 1:  For smart light

719
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,490
Speaker 8:  Bulbs. I think it will be a slow rollout. I spoke with Eve you spoke

720
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,090
Speaker 8:  with, and they have, you know, they have a plan, like they already have thread

721
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,780
Speaker 8:  radios and all their devices and they're, you know, staggering the rollout.

722
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:48,860
Speaker 8:  So I think you'll see as the, the initial, the devices that are in the

723
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,250
Speaker 8:  initial spec, those will come out pretty quickly because they've already

724
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,820
Speaker 8:  got hundreds of devices that are being tested and going through the process,

725
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,370
Speaker 8:  even though they don't have a spec, which confuses me slightly.

726
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,200
Speaker 8:  But you know, they, I think it's, they just don't have the final spec that,

727
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,560
Speaker 8:  so they're still tweaking things, but yeah, I think it'll be a slow process

728
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,310
Speaker 8:  starting probably around summer sort of looking like early June will be

729
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,880
Speaker 8:  when we'll see the new, most of the new ones starting to

730
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,870
Speaker 8:  appear. And then, you know, every couple of months, I think we'll be seeing

731
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,470
Speaker 8:  new devices come onto the market. As the spec gets updated

732
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,960
Speaker 8:  next black Friday is going to be huge.

733
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,250
Speaker 1:  Yeah, for sure. I suspect that apple and Google in particular are

734
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,070
Speaker 1:  eager to have some sort of official launch around or

735
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,760
Speaker 1:  right before their standard developer conferences, because I guarantee you,

736
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,750
Speaker 1:  they both want at WWDC and Google IO to be like, and by the way, the smart

737
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,590
Speaker 1:  home doesn't suck now. So I'm sure that that's something to look forward

738
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:43,860
Speaker 1:  to.

739
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,060
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And you know, to your point, the smart home, isn't about it. Shouldn't

740
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,870
Speaker 8:  be about building one smart home, all in one go, I mean, as

741
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,170
Speaker 8:  things stop working in your home and you need something, you have to fill

742
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:59,040
Speaker 8:  a need. It's always worth considering the smart version. I know

743
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,970
Speaker 8:  you're deeply skeptical, but anything that you buy today from a

744
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,780
Speaker 8:  trusted brand who has committed to matter if matter goes forward.

745
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,900
Speaker 8:  I do think you're going to find that it will work in that.

746
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,370
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Except for the Amazon division of ring at rest of Amazon. Cool. That

747
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,900
Speaker 1:  ring we don't know yet. This is

748
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,410
Speaker 8:  Basically

749
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,630
Speaker 1:  Okay. Well, the other thing to look forward to is

750
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,320
Speaker 1:  watching you have to review the hundreds of smart

751
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,430
Speaker 1:  catches that are coming out next year. Enjoy have fun. I

752
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,250
Speaker 1:  will I'll pitch in every night I'll pitch in on door locks. That's the one

753
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,720
Speaker 1:  thing that, where my life sucks right now.

754
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,540
Speaker 8:  So find you a good door. Look, I'm sure.

755
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,380
Speaker 8:  Now it's going to be fun. There's lots to look forward to.

756
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,270
Speaker 1:  All right. Cool. Well, thanks so much for chatting.

757
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:43,560
Speaker 8:  Great, thanks.

758
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,560
Speaker 1:  So that is matter. And next year we should see that big

759
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,520
Speaker 1:  splashy launch that I'm actually optimistic

760
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,940
Speaker 1:  about. Look at that a discussion about tech standards that ends with hope

761
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,380
Speaker 1:  also with a million things for Jennifer to review, sorry, Jennifer,

762
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,950
Speaker 1:  but thank you to her for coming on the verge cast and explaining it all to

763
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,940
Speaker 1:  us. Thanks also to Michelle Medalla Freeman from the CSA, Samantha

764
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,720
Speaker 1:  Fein from smart things and Tim boot from Eve for speaking with us,

765
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,650
Speaker 1:  the Vergecast is produced by myself, Andrew Moreno and Liam James.

766
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,490
Speaker 1:  This is the last of our run of Tuesday topic specific

767
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,880
Speaker 1:  episodes, but we'd really like to know what you think. And if you'd like

768
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,750
Speaker 1:  us to bring them back next year, you can tweet at me, I'm at backlog. And

769
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,500

770
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,890
Speaker 1:  regular Vergecast chat show. And then after that, you know, I bet you can

771
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,880
Speaker 1:  expect to see a bunch more battered news at CES in January,

772
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,420
Speaker 1:  which is happening again to all of us together.
