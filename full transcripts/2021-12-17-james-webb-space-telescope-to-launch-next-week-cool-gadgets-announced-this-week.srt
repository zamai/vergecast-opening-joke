26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,110
Speaker 1:  Hello, and welcome to rich cast the flagship podcast of 2022.

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,540
Speaker 1:  They're leading right into

28
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,360
Speaker 4:  Cause we're just, we're not going to do any twenties 21.

29
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,630
Speaker 1:  This is it. This is our last show of the year. It's true. I'm your friend,

30
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,980
Speaker 1:  the line dealer bonus. Here

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,190
Speaker 4:  I am. The guy wishing Nila, happy birthday. Oh

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,550
Speaker 1:  God.

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,280
Speaker 1:  I was telling Dieter that I think odd numbers, they sound older than

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,790
Speaker 1:  even numbers. So am turning an odd number. And I just like, don't want to

35
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,980
Speaker 1:  think about it, but next year will be an even number. I'll be like, this

36
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,400
Speaker 1:  is my birth.

37
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,260
Speaker 1:  This is my theory of aging. Anyway, Lauren crushes here.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,850
Speaker 1:  Surprise. I'm here and now trans is here. Hello. So it is in fact my

39
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,270
Speaker 1:  birthday and I'm just going to admit it. I've barely prepared for the show.

40
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,740
Speaker 1:  I just like, just like I got all day. I hope just

41
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,550
Speaker 1:  grant me this affordance is all I'm saying. I didn't want to miss our last

42
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,390
Speaker 1:  show of the year, but it was also my birthday. So Dieter is going to

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,500
Speaker 1:  trust the show.

44
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,760
Speaker 4:  And you like for your birthday, I, I want to tell you that I have come

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,060
Speaker 4:  around to believing that I are as stupid and I, our blasters are

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,890
Speaker 1:  Stupid. They're dumb. They've always been dumb,

47
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,880
Speaker 4:  But I was thinking about it some more and I'm like, you know, it's still

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,750
Speaker 4:  like a relatively easy, cheap, almost interoperable standard

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,990
Speaker 4:  that anybody can use to communicate with anything else if they have the IRR

50
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,510
Speaker 4:  ports. So maybe it's sort of analogous to a headphone Jack.

51
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,290
Speaker 1:  Maybe the fact that wired headphones are trying to, again, it's like my personal,

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,680
Speaker 1:  it's like a, it's like a victory for me. Every time I see one of those stories,

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,830
Speaker 1:  Maria, who people might know this from lots of videos, you know, she's

54
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,620
Speaker 1:  one of the trendiest people on our staff and she did it. She had an Instagram

55
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,960
Speaker 1:  story about her wired headphones the other day. And I was like, I did it.

56
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,850
Speaker 1:  That was me. I don't think that she knows that. I think that so Mara, if

57
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,130
Speaker 1:  you're listening, just, I want you to know you gave him that moment. That

58
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,040
Speaker 1:  personal victory. Yeah, no, it's all last year. The year we're taking that

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,850
Speaker 1:  subway software. We back after CS, everybody has a good break,

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,840
Speaker 1:  but there's still like a lot going on, including a big thing happening towards

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,440
Speaker 1:  the end of the year. That's why Lauren is here. The James Webb space, telescope

62
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,490
Speaker 5:  Nila. It's not just happening at the end of the year. It's happening

63
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,500
Speaker 5:  currently on Christmas Eve.

64
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,540
Speaker 1:  Hooray. We're going to hit Santa with a telescope,

65
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,650
Speaker 1:  hit

66
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,020
Speaker 1:  Merry Christmas boys and girls.

67
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,490
Speaker 5:  I'm doomed forever to cover some major

68
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,020
Speaker 5:  launch on another really important holiday.

69
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,210
Speaker 5:  That is just how these things shake out.

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,450
Speaker 1:  So moody was supposed to be 22nd and I moved to Christmasy. Why did that

71
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:01,720
Speaker 1:  happen?

72
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,560
Speaker 5:  18th? Actually, it was supposed to be 20 years ago.

73
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,650
Speaker 5:  And now it is happening on December 24th.

74
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,800
Speaker 1:  Yeah. All right. Let's start at the beginning. What is the James Webb space

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,470
Speaker 1:  telescope? It is a big deal. It's when people are working on this for a long

76
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:17,910
Speaker 1:  time, what is

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,240
Speaker 5:  So James Webb or JWST for short

78
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,410
Speaker 5:  is widely considered the successor to the Hubble space telescope. You might

79
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,340
Speaker 5:  be aware of some of its iconic images. It's currently orbiting around the

80
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,330
Speaker 5:  earth and it sees an optical wavelengths, but JWC is just

81
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,930
Speaker 5:  going to be so much more powerful and more sensitive than Hubble. And it

82
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,500
Speaker 5:  also sees an infrared light. So it's, it's a

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,460
Speaker 5:  special type of light on the, on the part of the

84
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,300
Speaker 5:  optical or the light wavelength spectrum. And the

85
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,000
Speaker 5:  reason we use infrared to

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
Speaker 5:  CCN is because we're trying to look at some of the most distant

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,070
Speaker 5:  galaxies in the universe. So these would be galaxies

88
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,670
Speaker 5:  that are roughly 13.6 billion, light years

89
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,600
Speaker 5:  away. And that's an important number because we think the universe, as we

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,360
Speaker 5:  know it after the big bang was

91
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,320
Speaker 5:  13.8 billion years ago. And so

92
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,370
Speaker 5:  because light takes such a long time to reach us.

93
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,450
Speaker 5:  If these things are 13.6 billion, light years away, then we

94
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,300
Speaker 5:  think that they formed roughly a hundred to

95
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,230
Speaker 5:  250 million years after the big bang. So we're basically looking

96
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,170
Speaker 5:  at baby pictures of the universe is kind of how I think of it.

97
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,730
Speaker 5:  And they're also moving away from us when they're, when they're that

98
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,390
Speaker 5:  far from us, they're moving away from us because the universe is expanding.

99
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,870
Speaker 5:  So they're moving. The farthest ones are moving the fastest away from us.

100
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,860
Speaker 5:  And when you move away, the light from those galaxies gets

101
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,190
Speaker 5:  shifted. It gets red shifted. So it moves towards the

102
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,330
Speaker 5:  infrared side of the spectrum. So that's why we have this amazing new infrared

103
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,390
Speaker 5:  telescope. It's going to be able to see all this infrared light from these

104
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,320
Speaker 5:  distant galaxies and really show us like what the universe

105
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,720
Speaker 5:  looked like when it was in its infancy.

106
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,040
Speaker 1:  You said the successor to Hubble, whatever. It's my birthday. I'm an old

107
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,340
Speaker 1:  man. Now I'm just going to date myself. I was in like elementary school when

108
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,270
Speaker 1:  the Hubble launched, it was a huge deal. The mirror was broken. They had

109
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,140
Speaker 1:  to fix the mirror. Yeah, don't remind me. But this was like, I mean, this

110
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,390
Speaker 1:  is like the highlight of fifth grade. It's like they fixed the mirror, right?

111
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,540
Speaker 1:  It does. I mean, I was like, I'm an astronaut. It didn't work out.

112
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,420
Speaker 1:  Spoiler alert got

113
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,470
Speaker 5:  A couple of billion dollars.

114
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,500
Speaker 1:  You can still do it. Well, yeah. Now I'm just going to like float around

115
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,460
Speaker 1:  on Michael strand. It's great. But is the Hubble over or we send a

116
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,720
Speaker 1:  crashing in the ocean what's going on with it?

117
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,570
Speaker 5:  No, no. And helpful is definitely not over. It would definitely won't last

118
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,500
Speaker 5:  forever, but I know we is still a very valuable part

119
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,370
Speaker 5:  of astronomy and continues to work to this day. This is

120
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,060
Speaker 5:  actually, yes, it's called a successor, but really it's a compliment because

121
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,900
Speaker 5:  Hubble has these amazing capabilities and how we'll actually solve

122
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,620
Speaker 5:  some really distant galaxies. You know, there's this really great

123
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,430
Speaker 5:  image called the Hubble deep field. And it has all these incredible number

124
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,210
Speaker 5:  of galaxies as far off galaxies that we were able to see what the telescope,

125
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,470
Speaker 5:  but it just can't go back as far as the JWC will be able

126
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,460
Speaker 5:  to. And so this is really just kind of adding to our knowledge and

127
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,210
Speaker 5:  having an even more amazing tool at our disposal. But Hubble will

128
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,720
Speaker 5:  still be a very valuable tool as long as it's up and running.

129
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,010
Speaker 4:  So one of the big primary unanswered questions, we're hoping to get

130
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,000
Speaker 4:  answers to here, you know, beyond very, very pretty pictures of far off

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,750
Speaker 4:  galaxies,

132
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,600
Speaker 5:  Basically everything. I mean, that's a pretty big one dealer,

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,280
Speaker 4:  You know, I, I never turned down a baby picture. Don't get me wrong, but

134
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,050
Speaker 5:  Well, the, the evolution of stars and galaxies is big. So we really

135
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,920
Speaker 5:  wanted to know, you know, how the earliest galaxies evolved

136
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,790
Speaker 5:  over time. Also, we want to have a better idea of just kind of the large

137
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,780
Speaker 5:  scale structure of the universe. So, you know, one thing hovel that

138
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,290
Speaker 5:  was really great at it was, was proving that the universe is

139
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,010
Speaker 5:  expanding. And so we really want to get like a better understanding of just

140
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,790
Speaker 5:  how fast it's expanding and what that means for the

141
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,330
Speaker 5:  future of the universe. And then probably the biggest

142
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,810
Speaker 5:  thing, not the biggest, but one of the biggest things that JWC will

143
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,740
Speaker 5:  do that nobody really even thought of when they came

144
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,010
Speaker 5:  up with the telescope, you know, roughly three decades ago

145
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,460
Speaker 5:  is using it to look into the atmospheres of

146
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,330
Speaker 5:  exoplanets. So exoplanets are planets that are outside of

147
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,050
Speaker 5:  our solar system or being around other stars. And we didn't even know

148
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,010
Speaker 5:  exoplanets existed prior to the 1990s. Obviously

149
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,000
Speaker 5:  people theorize that they existed, but we just didn't have a confirmation

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,990
Speaker 5:  of them. And now we know about thousands of exoplanets

151
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,710
Speaker 5:  because we've sent missions into space to actually find them and study them.

152
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,830
Speaker 5:  But the problem with studying exoplanets is, you know, it's a really

153
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,760
Speaker 5:  dark rock or gaseous object right next to a really

154
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,600
Speaker 5:  bright star or sun. And it's hard to

155
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,590
Speaker 5:  see that because the stars light drowns out that object. So the

156
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,550
Speaker 5:  only way that we really can know that an exoplanet exists is

157
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,330
Speaker 5:  through a technique called transiting. It's not the only way, but it's probably

158
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,320
Speaker 5:  the best way. So basically when the planet passes in front of the

159
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,160
Speaker 5:  star, it like momentarily dips the stars light just because there's a

160
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,000
Speaker 5:  little bit of blockage there and we can infer that

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,930
Speaker 5:  a planet is there, but we want to know like what's on the planet,

162
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,890
Speaker 5:  right? Cause we're, we're looking for earth 2.0, we're looking for

163
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,090
Speaker 5:  possible signs of life outside of our solar system. And the best way to

164
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,990
Speaker 5:  do that is to see what's in a planet's atmosphere. But like I

165
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,590
Speaker 5:  said, it's incredibly hard because there's, it's getting, getting

166
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,490
Speaker 5:  drowned out by the stars light. So what JWST might be able to do is

167
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,330
Speaker 5:  because it's so powerful and so sensitive is that it will be able to

168
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,260
Speaker 5:  look at the edges of that exoplanet as it passes in front of

169
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,710
Speaker 5:  the star or the edge of the star and see the light as it

170
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,520
Speaker 5:  filters through the edges of the atmosphere. Once that

171
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,390
Speaker 5:  light passes through all those gases and all those molecules, it works the

172
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,380
Speaker 5:  light in such a way that we can actually tell what molecules are present

173
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,860
Speaker 5:  and what gas is present. And depending on what gas is there,

174
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,090
Speaker 5:  you know, then we might be able to infer if there are signs of life on the

175
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,020
Speaker 5:  planet below, because you know, people, we put a lot of

176
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,980
Speaker 5:  gases into our planet's atmosphere that wouldn't be

177
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,660
Speaker 5:  there if we weren't here. Sorry. I hate to say it, but

178
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,600
Speaker 5:  we're discussing.

179
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,650
Speaker 1:  Look, I stand outside, just shooting off my hairspray into the

180
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,360
Speaker 1:  every day being like, find a salient like on my

181
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,460
Speaker 1:  Aquanet, just like looking for little green men,

182
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,900
Speaker 5:  We looking for disgusting aliens. Yes. Yeah. We're looking for

183
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,620
Speaker 5:  discussing private byproducts of alien life Nila. You're just doing your

184
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,630
Speaker 5:  part to help others.

185
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,790
Speaker 1:  I'm running SETI at home and I'm shooting hairspray into the

186
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,720
Speaker 1:  sky. You said this was supposed to launch 20 years ago. I mean,

187
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,120
Speaker 1:  it has, it has been like a long,

188
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,770
Speaker 5:  I believe the most ambitious projected

189
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,610
Speaker 5:  launch date was in 2007 and probably somewhere between 2007 and

190
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,090
Speaker 5:  2011. I mean, they first came up with the most, the

191
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Speaker 5:  earliest concept. It wasn't the iteration that we know now, but people

192
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,890
Speaker 5:  started talking about having a telescope of this nature as early as

193
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,760
Speaker 5:  1989. And then it, then it became more

194
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,570
Speaker 5:  formulated in the nineties. And yeah, they had

195
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,390
Speaker 5:  these really naive cost estimates of, you know,

196
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,990
Speaker 5:  500,000 to a billion dollars. And it would launch in

197
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,890
Speaker 5:  2007, between 2007 and 2011. Obviously

198
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,850
Speaker 5:  we overshot all of that. And now we're looking at

199
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,880
Speaker 5:  a price tag of roughly, you know, nearly two,

200
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,410
Speaker 5:  $10 billion. So

201
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,480
Speaker 6:  You're saying it's a James Cameron movie,

202
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,210
Speaker 5:  But that's also a great point that you bring up perspective is key here because

203
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,540
Speaker 5:  you know, this is going to revolutionize astronomy and

204
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,410
Speaker 5:  astrophysics and yes, 10 billion sounds like a lot of money, but it is

205
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,980
Speaker 5:  chump change when we put it in the perspective of other things that we spend

206
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,760
Speaker 5:  money on, you know, either from the federal government or like just how much

207
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,640
Speaker 5:  we spend on potato chips. Somebody reminded me.

208
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,930
Speaker 6:  I just think it's wild that like, we're going to see

209
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,070
Speaker 6:  what happened right after the big bang. Yeah. I messaged you earlier

210
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,790
Speaker 6:  this week about this because I was still stuck earlier this

211
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,780
Speaker 6:  week, thinking that the big bang was like a single explosion

212
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,710
Speaker 6:  and everything exploded out. I think I messaged you just saying,

213
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,880
Speaker 6:  what direction are they going to look? And that's not how the universe

214
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,360
Speaker 6:  works.

215
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,530
Speaker 5:  No, really the way to think of the big bang is just

216
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,250
Speaker 5:  that's it sparked the expansion of our universe. And so

217
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,210
Speaker 5:  that's how we, we, it's a, it's a very pivotal time, obviously in our

218
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,080
Speaker 5:  history, but yeah, it's, it's really when the expansion began and it's,

219
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,380
Speaker 5:  and it's, there are smarter people that can talk about this than me, but

220
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,000
Speaker 5:  yeah, it it's when the first galaxies and

221
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,360
Speaker 5:  there was, you know, very basic elements in the universe at the time.

222
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,320
Speaker 5:  And then they kind of formulated to form stars and formed galaxies. So

223
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,650
Speaker 5:  what we're really seeing is the first signs of that

224
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,610
Speaker 5:  formulation of, of stars and galaxies coming together, which is incredible.

225
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,080
Speaker 6:  And we might also find dark matter. Like we might be able to find

226
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,570
Speaker 6:  dark matter or see dark matter with this.

227
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,220
Speaker 5:  I have not looked into that as much, but yes, there are dark matters

228
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,950
Speaker 5:  studies, but you pointed that out to me, reminded me to look into it,

229
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,290
Speaker 5:  but I've been more fascinated with like the exoplanets.

230
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,930
Speaker 6:  I mean, aliens are also cool.

231
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,070
Speaker 6:  I get it.

232
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,660
Speaker 1:  So I hate to be the downer. We're talking about what we are going to be able

233
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,410
Speaker 1:  to do with this thing, but it's got to get off the ground. It is

234
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,100
Speaker 1:  itself very complicated. I've I am always, I'm totally

235
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,820
Speaker 1:  fascinated by the pictures of the mirror, which is this enormous mirror.

236
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,300
Speaker 1:  They're launching it from the middle of nowhere. How, how are they getting

237
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,290
Speaker 1:  it to where it needs to go, keeping it safe and getting it into the sky safely?

238
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,790
Speaker 5:  Probably the most wild part. And the reason why everyone has such

239
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,300
Speaker 5:  anxiety leading up to this is because it can't launch the

240
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,290
Speaker 5:  space the way that it needs to be in space. It has

241
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,160
Speaker 5:  to launch folded up because no current rockets that we

242
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,060
Speaker 5:  have available are wide enough to get it in

243
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,050
Speaker 5:  its full configuration out into space. So it has to fold up

244
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,830
Speaker 5:  like, you know, a little origami figuring, and

245
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,700
Speaker 5:  then once it gets into space, it ignites this really

246
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,810
Speaker 5:  complicated unfurling process. And you have to understand

247
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,710
Speaker 5:  that the telescope is a mixture of hard and

248
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,670
Speaker 5:  soft things. So the mirror obviously is this

249
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,580
Speaker 5:  very intricate gold-plated mirror, very tough,

250
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,330
Speaker 5:  you know, stuff. But then in order to make sure that it

251
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,560
Speaker 5:  stays super cold, which is important because it sees in the infrared, it

252
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,370
Speaker 5:  has to have a sun shield that is made out of this very

253
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,030
Speaker 5:  thin. Almost. It looks kind of like a plastic-y materials called

254
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,870
Speaker 5:  captain and that has to unfurl in space

255
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,680
Speaker 5:  too. So then it blocks the rays from the sun. And so it doesn't get so

256
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,640
Speaker 5:  high. It has to, it has to operate at a temperature close to

257
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,540
Speaker 5:  negative 400 degrees Fahrenheit. But this CA this material, the sun

258
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,320
Speaker 5:  shield is so thin and it's such a very thin membrane and there are four

259
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,160
Speaker 5:  layers of it. So there is a process in space where that

260
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,150
Speaker 5:  sun shield slowly opens up and, you know,

261
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,930
Speaker 5:  it has to work or else the whole thing kind of falls apart.

262
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,160
Speaker 5:  So that's just one of many different

263
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,330
Speaker 5:  things that have to happen while it unfurls in space. And I

264
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,780
Speaker 5:  think we are, we've been, I'm working on a story about that unfurling

265
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,500
Speaker 5:  process and the numbers I've heard is, you know, somewhere

266
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,470
Speaker 5:  over 300 single points of failure.

267
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,090
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And obviously it's you think it means it's

268
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,960
Speaker 5:  like, that thing must happen or else the entire

269
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,290
Speaker 5:  thing does not work. And it's just a

270
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,860
Speaker 5:  terrifying thing to think about. So, so yeah,

271
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,730
Speaker 5:  normally when, I mean, not normally, but most of the time when I'm following

272
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,150
Speaker 5:  a launch, we aren't happy until the thing separates from the

273
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,050
Speaker 5:  spacecraft. And then it unfurls its solar panels and it started getting

274
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,560
Speaker 5:  power. That's usually when we declare victory, but with

275
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,220
Speaker 5:  JWST, we won't be declared victory for at least another month

276
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,060
Speaker 5:  because that's how long it takes to unfurl and to get out to

277
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,240
Speaker 5:  its intended orbit, which is a million miles from,

278
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,050
Speaker 1:  Oh, so actually speaking to the intended Arbor, can you explain why this

279
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,200
Speaker 1:  thing is launching in the middle of nowhere? And actually, can you define

280
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:45,860
Speaker 1:  middle of nowhere?

281
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,750
Speaker 5:  Well, it's launching in crew French Guyana, which is the site of

282
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,560
Speaker 5:  Europe's primary spaceport. So this is an

283
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,250
Speaker 5:  international collaboration it's been to be, you know, used

284
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,030
Speaker 5:  by astronomers and scientists all over the world. And

285
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,870
Speaker 5:  so we, we made a deal with Ariana space to launch the

286
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,710
Speaker 5:  JWC on their area and five rocket and their primary

287
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,430
Speaker 5:  launch site is infringed Ghana. And I mean, for

288
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,730
Speaker 5:  most launches, I don't know if this has to do with

289
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,750
Speaker 5:  JWST. So forgive me for minimal mechanics people. But the

290
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,380
Speaker 5:  reason that a crew is such a great site is because it's near the

291
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,280
Speaker 5:  equator. And so we really liked to launch from near the equator

292
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,000
Speaker 5:  because that's where the earth is moving the fastest. So you get a

293
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,360
Speaker 5:  really like a little boost when you launch closer to the equator when you're

294
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,840
Speaker 5:  getting satellites into orbit. So that's why it was

295
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,680
Speaker 5:  located there.

296
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,120
Speaker 1:  What are the next like that month? 300 points of failure? Are

297
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,330
Speaker 1:  they clustered at the beginning of that month? Like we know right away or

298
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,210
Speaker 1:  is it like 30 days later? We're like crap, 16 things have to happen

299
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,510
Speaker 1:  today.

300
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,200
Speaker 5:  It's a two week process of unfurling. Okay. So the

301
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,100
Speaker 5:  sunshield deploys over a period of many days,

302
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,370
Speaker 5:  so there's really no time to relax

303
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,770
Speaker 1:  Adult anxiety. Well,

304
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,370
Speaker 4:  Let's be clear. We can't, if something goes wrong, we can, can we, can we

305
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,590
Speaker 4:  send astronauts up there to fix it?

306
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,540
Speaker 5:  No, not, not really.

307
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,120
Speaker 1:  I wish I wish everybody could have seen Lauren's face.

308
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,280
Speaker 1:  No, no, no.

309
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,160
Speaker 4:  Can Bruce Willis get up there for the drill and do

310
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,210
Speaker 4:  something, right?

311
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We don't even have the capabilities that astronauts to where JWC

312
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,070
Speaker 5:  is going, cause it's going a million miles from earth. But even if we

313
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,550
Speaker 5:  did, the telescope was not made to

314
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,540
Speaker 5:  be serviceable, like Hubble was, you know, from the

315
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,410
Speaker 5:  beginning, Hubble was designed to be serviceable. So the

316
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,020
Speaker 5:  way that they built the components, they built them in such a way that you

317
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,800
Speaker 5:  could swap things out and fix them with certain tools. They even did. They

318
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,740
Speaker 5:  designed completely new tools just to

319
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,390
Speaker 5:  work with Hubble. But with DWC, that was just, it was

320
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,480
Speaker 5:  just not an option. Now I did talk to

321
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,520
Speaker 5:  some NASA folks about this. There are targets on it so that

322
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,480
Speaker 5:  if maybe we want to try refueling at some day, we could

323
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,320
Speaker 5:  do that. But if say an actuator just completely

324
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,130
Speaker 5:  breaks or if the sun shield doesn't deploy or many other, these things

325
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,580
Speaker 5:  happen, then we are kind of out of luck.

326
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,370
Speaker 4:  Once again, the right to repair is so important.

327
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,690
Speaker 1:  I mean, the whole thing is like really, like, it was a totally different

328
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,990
Speaker 1:  paradigm of space, right? Like they thought the space shuttle would just

329
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,740
Speaker 1:  be going up every day to fix satellites. Yeah. And so they, like,

330
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,890
Speaker 1:  I don't know. It was just like crazy to think that that's what we thought

331
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,860
Speaker 1:  would be happening in space. And then like quickly we're like, wait, that's

332
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,770
Speaker 1:  it. We just launched another satellite. That's easier.

333
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,590
Speaker 5:  This is the Microsoft surface of satellites. Right.

334
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,480
Speaker 5:  Very difficult. What you've ordered is what you get.

335
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,560
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Is there a reason that they designed it? I mean, it's been a long

336
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,280
Speaker 1:  time they're ready to launch it, but is there a reason that it's designed

337
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,240
Speaker 1:  with so much anxiety built into the unfurling

338
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,610
Speaker 1:  process? Could it have been more redundant?

339
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,210
Speaker 5:  I asked that question and the answer is basically no.

340
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,740
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Just because there, I mean, there's the thing in the launch

341
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,550
Speaker 5:  industry known as the tyranny of the fairing and

342
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,910
Speaker 5:  essentially what they're talking about. So at the top of a rocket, it's known

343
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,690
Speaker 5:  as a payload fairing, and it's what covers the payload so that it doesn't

344
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,770
Speaker 5:  burn up as you're launching to space. The problem with that

345
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,580
Speaker 5:  is that the bigger you make your rocket, the more fuel you need in it.

346
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,480
Speaker 5:  Right? So at some point you have to limit how big your rocket

347
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,930
Speaker 5:  is. And that size limit is what

348
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,890
Speaker 5:  often dictates the design of a satellite, right?

349
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,530
Speaker 5:  So you can't launch something that's wider than Falcon

350
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,380
Speaker 5:  nine on the Falcon nine, unless you fold it up. So that's, that's

351
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,210
Speaker 5:  where this comes in and this, and the thing is they decided they

352
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,990
Speaker 5:  wanted to have this mirror be how, you know,

353
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,370
Speaker 5:  over, I think roughly it's like roughly more than 20 feet long, right?

354
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,760
Speaker 1:  Because you haven't seen a picture of this mirror go goo. It's like a wild

355
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,480
Speaker 1:  thing to look at.

356
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,800
Speaker 5:  And because they wanted that size of a mirror, they knew they had

357
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,460
Speaker 5:  to figure out a way to fold it up because there was no rocket that was going

358
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,300
Speaker 5:  to be able, like the mirror alone is too wide for any rocket available.

359
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,080
Speaker 5:  Now all the space X people come at me and be like, well, one

360
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,950
Speaker 5:  day we'll have star ship. And that could eventually launch

361
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,820
Speaker 5:  really big telescopes, which Ilan has definitely talked about, but that

362
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,800
Speaker 5:  rocket is not available to us at the most.

363
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,120
Speaker 1:  And then it's being delayed like day by day, right. 18th to 22nd, 24th. Why

364
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,750
Speaker 1:  is that happening?

365
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,340
Speaker 5:  It was a communication issue between

366
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,390
Speaker 5:  the rocket and the payload, as I understand it, but they think they

367
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,990
Speaker 5:  have it resolved with they're having a meeting at 6:00 PM on

368
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,740
Speaker 5:  Thursday. So it's very possible that it could be Christmas

369
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,670
Speaker 5:  day launch by the time this podcast airs, which would be

370
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,110
Speaker 5:  amazing.

371
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,420
Speaker 5:  That was the latest thing. And the other one that, I mean, they had to push

372
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,990
Speaker 5:  it back a few days because some clamps snapped

373
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,800
Speaker 5:  and sent vibrations throughout the entire

374
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,430
Speaker 5:  spacecraft that wasn't supposed to happen. So they wanted to make sure that

375
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,270
Speaker 5:  that didn't damage anything. But yeah, I, you

376
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,690
Speaker 5:  have to understand we've never launched anything of this

377
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,380
Speaker 5:  complexity ever before. And so yeah, we have

378
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,370
Speaker 5:  experienced putting payloads on rockets, but we definitely do not have experience

379
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,300
Speaker 5:  putting this kind of payload on a rocket. So everything that we've done

380
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,020
Speaker 5:  before does it, it helps, but it's not, it's

381
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,680
Speaker 5:  all a whole new experience. So of course there's going to

382
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,160
Speaker 5:  be challenges along the way because putting the most

383
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,000
Speaker 5:  complicated space telescope on top of its rocket is just a completely new

384
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,170
Speaker 5:  experience for us.

385
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,550
Speaker 6:  Is this more or less comp complicated from a

386
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,510
Speaker 6:  engineering perspective than putting somebody on the moon? Oh,

387
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,030
Speaker 1:  My Alex was like the existential. Oh my

388
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,090
Speaker 5:  Goodness. I don't know. Cause I keep hearing that like,

389
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,450
Speaker 6:  This is the most complex thing we've ever sent and it's like maybe when we

390
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,470
Speaker 6:  sent like three guys,

391
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,750
Speaker 1:  Then they were an emotionally complex. I've watched it. I see

392
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,770
Speaker 1:  first man. That's like a,

393
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,690
Speaker 5:  That's a great question because once you're in space,

394
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,290
Speaker 5:  the people can potentially, you know, fix

395
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,920
Speaker 5:  errors. And I mean, obviously it's really still very

396
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,430
Speaker 5:  hard, but they can still have some agency over the

397
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,240
Speaker 5:  spacecraft. If something goes wrong with JWST, we have

398
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,990
Speaker 5:  to send signals to it from the ground.

399
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,680
Speaker 5:  That's our only way of, you know, fixing it. But then

400
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,560
Speaker 5:  again, it does not need life support systems or food or anything.

401
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,250
Speaker 5:  So I don't know, this is a great question. Something for

402
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,170
Speaker 5:  engineers to debate who are not me.

403
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,030
Speaker 1:  All right. So this is hopefully happening Christmas Eve a the time you're

404
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,710
Speaker 1:  listening to this Christmas day, we'll be looking forward to that. Lauren,

405
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,360
Speaker 1:  last thing I wanna ask you about, you wrote a pretty big piece about the

406
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,350
Speaker 1:  culture at space X this week five former employees have spoken

407
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,920
Speaker 1:  out about that culture about harassment. That SpaceX is one of those companies

408
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,640
Speaker 1:  that we just don't hear a lot about internally, but it seems like this was

409
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,600
Speaker 1:  a big deal. There was another essay by one of these employees. I know what

410
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,870
Speaker 1:  a whistleblower site called lioness. It's hard to describe what lioness is,

411
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,240
Speaker 1:  but you can go look at it. Tell us about that story. A little bit.

412
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,860
Speaker 5:  One former employee decided Joe, who just recently left,

413
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,400
Speaker 5:  decided to pin this essay in lioness

414
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,390
Speaker 5:  and the allegations that she made were pretty shocking. And

415
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,200
Speaker 5:  so, you know, we kind of worked to

416
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,190
Speaker 5:  find other former employees, mostly interns, I

417
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,030
Speaker 5:  realized who worked at space X to see if they could kind of

418
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,570
Speaker 5:  corroborate some of her experiences. And they

419
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,500
Speaker 5:  definitely did. And yeah, I would just encourage everyone to go read it.

420
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,370
Speaker 5:  It's a rare glimpse inside of space. X is culture. And I think the main

421
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,030
Speaker 5:  theme is that they all felt like they themselves

422
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,990
Speaker 5:  experienced inappropriate behavior or they saw other women

423
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,560
Speaker 5:  and non-binary individuals experiencing inappropriate behavior.

424
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,880
Speaker 5:  And when it came to whether or not to report it, they all had

425
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,870
Speaker 5:  very different and inconsistent responses from the HR department

426
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:21,650
Speaker 5:  or their managers, many of which that they did not see as adequate.

427
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,130
Speaker 5:  And they all have their various opinions as to why that is.

428
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,670
Speaker 5:  So I'll leave it to them to explain it. So

429
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,940
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that piece is on the site. It's just really great work. And I wanted

430
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,660
Speaker 1:  to call it up before, let you know, so you can go read that. And then sometime

Speaker 3:  much your prescription is about to cost. Prescription prices can vary between

472
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,620
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back theater. You've assembled a list of

473
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,210
Speaker 1:  gadgets here for us to talk about.

474
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,380
Speaker 4:  Usually we save the wacky gadgets for the end, but I, it, it it's,

475
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,730
Speaker 4:  you know, it's the holidays.

476
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,030
Speaker 1:  I tell people usually there's like themes and how these are ordered, but

477
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,520
Speaker 1:  this list is just titled cool gadget.

478
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,870
Speaker 4:  So look, Sony made a speaker that looks

479
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,320
Speaker 4:  like a bong. And I just think that they deserve some credit

480
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,280
Speaker 4:  for making a bong shaped speaker it's glass. It's

481
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,670
Speaker 4:  got a light on it. The glass is part of the speaker

482
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,200
Speaker 4:  and it does a little candlelight thing. And I don't know what's going on

483
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,920
Speaker 4:  with CES this year. As of this recording, some of us are going,

484
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,490
Speaker 4:  we'll see if COVID allows that to happen. This is the sort of thing that

485
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,180
Speaker 4:  we would expect to see at CES, but I kind of liked that. Sony

486
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,940
Speaker 4:  just said, you know what, here it is, here's the thing we made this

487
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,980
Speaker 1:  There's a throwaway line. So Chris waltz reviewed this thing. It's called

488
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,700
Speaker 1:  the Sony glass sound speaker. There's a throwaway line as a reading it. And

489
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,510
Speaker 1:  like, he's well, just like Sony believes in this so

490
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,150
Speaker 1:  much that this is the third generation of this device.

491
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,520
Speaker 1:  And I, you know, there's like, there's just a handful of teams at Sony

492
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,960
Speaker 1:  that I am desperate to know better. Like there's the

493
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,950
Speaker 1:  team that makes the party speakers. And they're like, here's what

494
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,700
Speaker 1:  the frat boys need this year. And they ha they have to have that meeting

495
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,790
Speaker 1:  right there. Like, and then there's right next to them. I'm assuming it's

496
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,770
Speaker 1:  very competitive. There's like the karaoke speaker department. Right?

497
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,770
Speaker 1:  And you can just see that they kind of overlap with the donut and the party

498
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,760
Speaker 1:  speakers are not karaoke speaker. Like I know it. I know that that's a fight

499
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,630
Speaker 1:  inside the halls of Sony. If anybody wants me to write that XYZ, I am

500
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,320
Speaker 1:  ready and willing to do it. Then there's like the

501
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,560
Speaker 1:  high-end home theater stuff that makes no sense department.

502
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,940
Speaker 1:  Like here's a $20,000 short range projector that you can put one inch from

503
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,750
Speaker 1:  the wall and it'll pull it up 400 inch, seven

504
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,470
Speaker 1:  20 P picture. And it's like, none of that makes sense. But

505
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,400
Speaker 1:  I love that you've made 15 of these. Yeah. Then there's like the part that's

506
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,670
Speaker 1:  like, if we made yet another memory card format,

507
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,270
Speaker 1:  right? Like Sony just does that. So what they do, that's just a core part

508
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,900
Speaker 1:  of their business. And then there's this group that's like the

509
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,740
Speaker 1:  wacky gadgets that you would never expect. Like

510
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,010
Speaker 1:  this one, it's a glass tube has an led in the middle that flickers like a

511
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,760
Speaker 1:  candle. Why? But they've done it for three generations and

512
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,600
Speaker 1:  running. Yeah. And I just want to know, I just, I just like, if

513
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,440
Speaker 1:  those PMs call me, they can come on decoder. If anyone knows,

514
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,520
Speaker 1:  like, do they have a P and L do they have to go to like the Sony

515
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,640
Speaker 1:  executive meeting and be like, you know, our budget for this year. And our

516
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,330
Speaker 1:  revenue really, really suggests that we should make a fourth generation of

517
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,230
Speaker 1:  the bond candle.

518
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,460
Speaker 4:  Here's the, here's the answer. Are you ready? Yeah. The amount of R and

519
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,150
Speaker 4:  D that goes into making a bond candle speaker is

520
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,140
Speaker 4:  so intense that the people who make it have to cut themselves

521
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,010
Speaker 4:  off from the world. And so nobody has given them the message yet

522
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,970
Speaker 4:  that there are no more WIWORK lobbies to fill.

523
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,640
Speaker 6:  They're just out there, they're on like an oil rig in the middle of the ocean

524
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,030
Speaker 6:  working on this project. They just send missives back.

525
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,260
Speaker 1:  There's there's some account at Sony with it like a spreadsheet, right. That's

526
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,040
Speaker 1:  like Mo like sales projections for bond candles

527
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:37,690
Speaker 1:  tear.

528
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,630
Speaker 4:  Okay. And no one will pay attention to them.

529
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,760
Speaker 1:  I'm just saying, I'll give you the whole show, like that account. Like

530
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,410
Speaker 1:  talk to me. Yeah. Okay.

531
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,460
Speaker 4:  Another cool gadget is the analog pocket. This thing

532
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,610
Speaker 4:  is great. So it's a, it's a game boy. It's a modern game. Boy that could

533
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,310
Speaker 4:  play gameboard cartridges. You could also get an adapter to play game gear,

534
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,030
Speaker 4:  cartridges. It is incredibly well designed. It has an amazing

535
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,630
Speaker 4:  screen. Andrew Webster reviewed it. And I just, I look at this

536
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,320
Speaker 4:  thing and I can see in my mind's eye,

537
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,430
Speaker 4:  a box in my parents' attic with my GameBoy cartridges,

538
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,870
Speaker 4:  all I want to do is go find them. Yeah. So

539
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,620
Speaker 4:  we had one here in San Francisco cause Viren was taking photos of it for

540
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,490
Speaker 4:  Andrew's review. And it is, it's amazing. It's it? It feels great.

541
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,330
Speaker 4:  The plastic isn't quite like ultra premium, I guess is how I would say it's

542
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,080
Speaker 4:  like, you can kind of feel like there was maybe like the tiniest of cost-cutting

543
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,980
Speaker 4:  there, but in terms of like a thing to play game

544
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,980
Speaker 4:  boy games, there's literally nothing better. And they really didn't need

545
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,060
Speaker 4:  go this hard, but they did. And it's amazing

546
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,470
Speaker 1:  Synthesize of like the original game boy or like the game

547
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,370
Speaker 1:  boy pocket.

548
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,640
Speaker 4:  Oh, it's like the original game. Boy. It's like a little tiny bit bigger.

549
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,570
Speaker 4:  Maybe even than the original game. Boy, it's that big? It's pretty big. Yeah.

550
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,120
Speaker 4:  But like, it feels comfortable, right? Because like the shoulder buttons

551
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,540
Speaker 4:  are at the base of where the cartridge goes in and it's got four buttons

552
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,320
Speaker 4:  instead of two. And so like, if you think about the ergonomics of your

553
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,280
Speaker 4:  hand, you, you don't want, if you're going to make it much smaller,

554
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,110
Speaker 4:  you're, you're going to make a whole bunch of other trade-offs. And like

555
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,890
Speaker 4:  the trade-offs they chose to make was having a really great screen and the

556
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,790
Speaker 4:  ability for it to do more stuff than just be a game boy run

557
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,670
Speaker 4:  game by cartridges said, can, you can put the adapter in for game gear. And

558
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,630
Speaker 4:  so it's like, it's a more interesting versatile gadget, just a

559
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,230
Speaker 4:  game boy game.

560
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,790
Speaker 1:  The reason I ask is not to give any budding

561
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,660
Speaker 1:  young students, this idea that the game boy pocket fit

562
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,410
Speaker 1:  perfectly into the slide cover of a Tia 82 calculator.

563
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,500
Speaker 1:  And so when I was in high school, we'd

564
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,640
Speaker 1:  pretend that we are programming our TA 80 twos and calculus, but

565
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,600
Speaker 1:  really we were playing Zelda. And so at the beginning of calculus, we

566
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,660
Speaker 1:  would have, we would do it, but you turn it on. And the only sound you could

567
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,650
Speaker 1:  not mute on the gateway pocket was the startup time. The Dean. Yeah.

568
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,830
Speaker 1:  And we got coffee. Cause

569
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,200
Speaker 4:  You weren't like going in

570
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,690
Speaker 1:  The middle of the winter. Like we did that for like weeks on end. We're like,

571
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,350
Speaker 1:  yeah, like, anyway, I was just, it brought back. I saw this thing and I was

572
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:13,250
Speaker 1:  like, oh, I could probably slide this into a TA to bring it

573
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,550
Speaker 1:  back. I guess people probably slide their phones into their TA 80 twos. Now

574
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,920
Speaker 4:  People don't know the difference between you and me. Like you grow up rock

575
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,400
Speaker 4:  and roll playing game boy. And your, your  thing. I grew up just like

576
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,500
Speaker 4:  programming the TA 80. No,

577
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,460
Speaker 4:   on

578
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,690
Speaker 4:  the TA. Come on.

579
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,890
Speaker 1:  We've done all that. But w when the game boy pocket came out, when we, I

580
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,280
Speaker 1:  remember this shout out to my friend, Ryan, he was like, let me see that

581
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,160
Speaker 1:  for a second. And he went, we're like, oh,

582
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,770
Speaker 1:  heavens opened

583
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,710
Speaker 1:  this thing is great. I'm probably going to buy one. I don't know why, but

584
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,640
Speaker 1:  I'm super into it

585
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,160
Speaker 4:  Presales this week for it. Yeah. I'm still waiting for my

586
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,130
Speaker 4:  play date. Yeah. So waiting on my play date, they had to push some stuff

587
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,500
Speaker 4:  back, but good on them. They like, they were, they've been very transparent

588
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,680
Speaker 4:  to the whole process. So I'm not actually agitating about it.

589
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,950
Speaker 1:  Yeah. They've been very open and they've just got a massive supply chain

590
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,450
Speaker 1:  issues, right? Yep. All right.

591
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,090
Speaker 4:  Ah, man, I actually there's, there's something I want to talk about, but

592
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,460
Speaker 4:  we're going to talk about it later because now we're going to talk about

593
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,130
Speaker 4:  the Opal C1. This is a webcam

594
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,570
Speaker 1:  I'm super into this.

595
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,430
Speaker 4:  So Cameron reviewed it.

596
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,750
Speaker 1:  That counts. Your camera is off right now because it's overheated. Yeah.

597
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,170
Speaker 4:  I mean, come on. This thing has a giant like heat fin on the back of it.

598
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,740
Speaker 4:  I'm going to buy

599
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,060
Speaker 1:  One of these for you. Yeah.

600
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,200
Speaker 4:  So it's a high end webcam with good, with a good microphones that are like

601
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,600
Speaker 4:  supposed to be great at noise canceling they're okay. But it's basically

602
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,490
Speaker 4:  like all the stuff that makes smartphone a better camera than your average

603
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,240
Speaker 4:  webcam. There's like, well, let's just make a bespoke webcam. That's based

604
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,840
Speaker 4:  on smartphone parts. So it's got a, the Sony sensor, I think from the pixel

605
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,830
Speaker 4:  one, it's got a bunch of other like smart Senate. It's better at background

606
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,670
Speaker 4:  blur than like, Zoom's really ugly background blur. It's like

607
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,080
Speaker 4:  300 bucks. So

608
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,700
Speaker 1:  It's expensive. But I was thinking about this, like my

609
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,600
Speaker 1:  Zevi one that I use, I use a Sony Z one is my webcam.

610
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,470
Speaker 1:  Yeah, same. It is expensive. It was four or 500 bucks or whatever it was.

611
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,670
Speaker 1:  It's complicated. Like I would never send this to anyone

612
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,390
Speaker 1:  else to use as a webcam because you have to monkey with the settings, you

613
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,200
Speaker 1:  need a USB capture card, or you have to use Sony imaging edge, which is

614
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,790
Speaker 1:  Alex's personal nemesis.

615
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,460
Speaker 1:  All that's a mess. But this thing is like a little more expensive than what

616
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,910
Speaker 1:  you might spend on a webcam. Yep. I think the sensor part of it's really

617
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,880
Speaker 1:  interesting. Right. We, we have not spent a lot of time in the show talking

618
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,600
Speaker 1:  about the sensor from the pixel. One is like a great

619
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,530
Speaker 1:  sensor. It was the software that made and it was, it's a Sony sensor.

620
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,070
Speaker 1:  It is the same Sony sensor, but it's a software that made that sensor good.

621
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,420
Speaker 1:  And they basically with the pixel anyway, they ran it to the

622
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,170
Speaker 1:  edge of its limits. And now they've had to go to a new sensor. Yep. So it's

623
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,930
Speaker 1:  like fascinating to me that they're using that sensor. And it's like on the

624
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,260
Speaker 1:  website, they're hyping up the sensor. But in the context of the show, we're

625
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,280
Speaker 1:  like, here's this whole,

626
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,060
Speaker 4:  The sensor made by the way, designed by the same person who designed the

627
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,020
Speaker 4:  Google clips camera.

628
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,080
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it does. Doesn't like an all star team writes X, Google, X, apple.

629
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,530
Speaker 1:  What's really interesting to me is their pricing models. You can buy the

630
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,980
Speaker 1:  thing right now. It's plug and play with windows,

631
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,760
Speaker 1:  plug and play with Mac. But if you want all the software features that like

632
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,420
Speaker 1:  really get the most out of it. You need software at the softwares Mac only

633
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,700
Speaker 1:  right now. And it's a subscription.

634
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,440
Speaker 6:  Yep. So it's like, do I want to just have my camera overheat every day?

635
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,880
Speaker 6:  Or do I want to pay us?

636
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,630
Speaker 4:  I want you to, I want you to pay a subscription so bad.

637
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,640
Speaker 6:  I know what this room, the thing

638
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,640
Speaker 4:  I will pay you a subscription. I will pay your subscription

639
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,380
Speaker 1:  Fee. I mean, it's cheap. It's like,

640
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,000
Speaker 6:  It's very, I I've been investigating the C1

641
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,230
Speaker 1:  And right now it's free for early customers. So if you pre-order, it it's

642
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,800
Speaker 1:  free. They say, but it's just as one of those things, right? Like

643
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,120
Speaker 1:  every one of these products is turning into a recurring revenue stream.

644
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,350
Speaker 1:  So now you're now a hardware. Webcam has like subscription

645
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,220
Speaker 1:  software. The remote starting a Toyota requires a

646
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,160
Speaker 1:  subscription. Oh, we're going to get to that. It's just coming to everything.

647
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,880
Speaker 1:  It's killing me

648
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,660
Speaker 4:  The other hand on the, on the flip side of that, I just bought this a Garmin

649
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,140
Speaker 4:  venue too. And I wanted to buy this watch face. And the way you buy the watch

650
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,100
Speaker 4:  face is you read the description and the guy says, please PayPal me and make

651
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,950
Speaker 4:  sure you pay pal me as a friend. So we don't have to pay the fees. And then

652
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,740
Speaker 4:  a couple of days later, he gets back to you with the code to unlock the pro

653
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,570
Speaker 4:  features, which currently

654
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,230
Speaker 1:  I love it. It's very, it's very personal. It's very, it's like, artisinal

655
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,980
Speaker 1:  watch faces. I will say the OPL. You should. It looks good. That's

656
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,440
Speaker 1:  actually the point of this, all this. Like it is not just like a pixel one

657
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,980
Speaker 1:  quality video. They've done a bunch of computational

658
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,670
Speaker 1:  photography stuff with that sensor. They've got an Intel chip in there. Cameron

659
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,700
Speaker 1:  really likes it when he reviewed it. I'm like, like immediately emailed them.

660
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,260
Speaker 1:  I was like, give me a code to buy this.

661
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,020
Speaker 4:  We'll see this next one is for Alex. It's the Dell,

662
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,410
Speaker 4:  it's a concept device from Dell. It's called the stanza. It's basically just

663
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,130
Speaker 4:  a little tablet that you can like take notes on. And then that's all, it's

664
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,860
Speaker 4:  literally all it does. And then you'd like to have the thing and it'll digitize

665
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,210
Speaker 4:  it. And it'll

666
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,810
Speaker 6:  You use it as a monitor, right?

667
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,320
Speaker 4:  Sure. But I mean, let's not get too crazy here. The idea here is they're

668
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,950
Speaker 4:  trying to simplify it down to the core idea of taking

669
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,850
Speaker 4:  notes. And I just want to know why

670
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,750
Speaker 4:  isn't this e-cig

671
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,740
Speaker 6:  That's that's what would be my question too? That's why Dell didn't allow

672
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,860
Speaker 6:  me in the room. No, I didn't. I didn't go. They probably would have allowed

673
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,630
Speaker 6:  me, but when I said eating, they probably would have kicked me out. Yeah.

674
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,940
Speaker 6:  But yeah, I just, I mean, I get it. I think

675
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,120
Speaker 6:  that's the big push pull, right? Like a lot of people really want full color

676
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,350
Speaker 6:  that he has terrible still at. So they're like, okay, let's do this.

677
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,310
Speaker 6:  Let's try to like mimic writing, even though I think it's a lot worse. Like

678
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,790
Speaker 6:  the writing experience on an iPad versus remarkable too, is

679
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:52,480
Speaker 6:  just night and day different. But this could be cool if it comes out

680
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,270
Speaker 4:  Of, I don't think they're ever going to make this and this feels like

681
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,380
Speaker 1:  Classic it's CS time. There's some designers at

682
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,980
Speaker 1:  Dell. Here's some stuff. Yeah. And they just did it kind of early, you know?

683
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,150
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It looks kind of like an iPad. Like I got very iPad

684
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,770
Speaker 6:  feelings from it. Yeah. Okay.

685
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,380
Speaker 4:  Okay. Oh wait. You know what, I'm going out of order. I was going to say

686
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,140
Speaker 4:  this to the Android section, but we're, we're still in cool gadget zone.

687
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,160
Speaker 4:  So here we go. The APO find N it is a new

688
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,850
Speaker 4:  folding phone from APO only it be available in China. Basically

689
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,930
Speaker 4:  take your standard galaxy Z fold three. But instead of, instead of having

690
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:29,680
Speaker 4:  it be super tall, just make it a little shorter when it's

691
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,310
Speaker 4:  closed. So if you open it up, it's almost square and it takes the

692
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,500
Speaker 4:  like weird dude

693
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,780
Speaker 4:  strangeness, remote quality of the other thing and makes it feel,

694
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,100
Speaker 4:  I dunno, more like a human size, like, like pocketbook or like a notebook

695
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,670
Speaker 4:  or something. Yeah. And it's just like the build quality is

696
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,720
Speaker 4:  really, really nice. And for a company that,

697
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,260
Speaker 4:  you know, like we're going to get into some of the problems they've been

698
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,070
Speaker 4:  having with the OnePlus foot, but for a company that is just rolling into

699
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,280
Speaker 4:  foldable phones as a first entry, standby for tactical, took a look at this

700
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,150
Speaker 4:  thing. It looks great. It's a beautiful little phone. And they

701
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:10,300
Speaker 4:  didn't overextend themselves like Samsung did with like the under screened

702
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:14,230
Speaker 4:  selfie camera, you know, and that the size of the

703
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,710
Speaker 4:  screen what's unfolded. They don't have to bother with a bunch of like

704
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,820
Speaker 4:  multitasking questions because it's not quite big enough for that.

705
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,200
Speaker 4:  It's just a nice big screen that folds up into a size that doesn't feel ridiculous.

706
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,070
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think one of the things we keep talking about with folding phones

707
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,980
Speaker 1:  over and over and over again is what is the form factor

708
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,550
Speaker 1:  for this technology? Like what does a folding screen

709
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,300
Speaker 1:  actually enable? Yeah. And Samsung kind of went big

710
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:45,200
Speaker 1:  phone to big tablet, which is a very Samsung, like it's just in keeping

711
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,980
Speaker 1:  with her. It's what you would expect from them. They also went like flip

712
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,540
Speaker 1:  phone to little guy.

713
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:53,900
Speaker 4:  Right. And while he has got one of these now to the  flip, but

714
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,110
Speaker 1:  I think this, this is like an unexplored, middle zone is what you're getting

715
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:01,100
Speaker 1:  at. Right. Like small phone to small tablet. Yeah. But

716
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,010
Speaker 1:  like a small tablet is just a big phone. Like there's something in there.

717
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:04,190
Speaker 1:  That's

718
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,900
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well it's doesn't have the complications. I like the two screens on

719
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,470
Speaker 4:  like the surface duo service do a two. I would like to see

720
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:16,220
Speaker 4:  more foldable form factors. And not just because I like seeing wacky phones,

721
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,120
Speaker 4:  but like LG has given up the ghost. So it's

722
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,930
Speaker 4:  good to come from places like APO Huawei, Sharmi, because

723
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,920
Speaker 4:  Samsung is like set. And I think that for, in this zone

724
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,460
Speaker 4:  of folding phones and then like in the zone of like Android innovation,

725
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,540
Speaker 4:  Samsung has had way too much leverage at least outside of China in terms

726
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,530
Speaker 4:  of like how people think about what the trajectory of phones should be. And

727
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,310
Speaker 4:  so I really hope that stuff like this will encourage other companies

728
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:47,180
Speaker 4:  to do more experimental stuff and

729
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,630
Speaker 4:  like experimental stuff that actually could be sold because like TCL we'll

730
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,350
Speaker 4:  show you wacky prototypes all day long, but no, they're, they're

731
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:58,010
Speaker 4:  bad. I actually want to see more stuck at closer to like

732
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,160
Speaker 4:  actual production. And this is a, this is a good sign. That's a good, good

733
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,670
Speaker 4:  step on the way

734
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,540
Speaker 1:  I'm looking at this wall, AP 50 pocket that you just mentioned that we have

735
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,690
Speaker 1:  unless too, and it's the same rules. It's

736
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,990
Speaker 4:  Cool. Right. It's got the two circles on it once for the display once for

737
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,450
Speaker 4:  the camera array. It looks great. Yeah.

738
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,970
Speaker 1:  I mean, it's funny. Cause like, you know, this thing was not announced for

739
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,780
Speaker 1:  the United States at all. Like yeah. It was announced in a Harper's bizarre

740
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,890
Speaker 1:  China photo-shoot

741
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,640
Speaker 1:  Rules because it was in a fashion photo shoot. Yeah. Like we have no

742
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,420
Speaker 1:  idea, but I just keep looking in it's like, what is, what is the big

743
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,140
Speaker 1:  question? Like what form factor does this display technology

744
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,130
Speaker 1:  actually enable that people want? And we've, we've only taken a couple

745
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:40,370
Speaker 1:  shots.

746
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And like we've only taken a couple we've taken, well, there's more

747
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,480
Speaker 4:  than a couple, but we've only taken like two, like good shots. Everything

748
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,440
Speaker 4:  else has been like bad. Like just like you hit the uprights,

749
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:51,620
Speaker 4:  if

750
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,350
Speaker 1:  Can you just dog like talked it off the uprights. I mean, like

751
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,550
Speaker 1:  I get it, like there's other stuff like LG will make you a hundred thousand

752
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,400
Speaker 1:  dollars TV that rolls up at the foot of your bed. Yeah.

753
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,150
Speaker 4:  Where's the fan

754
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:09,110
Speaker 1:  Version. Yeah. Like that's what I want. Right. Like none

755
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,100
Speaker 1:  of that stuff exists.

756
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:13,970
Speaker 4:  What about the watch version? Because there's a patent for a Samsung

757
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,960
Speaker 4:  watch that unrolls and expands out and

758
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,140
Speaker 4:  it's like, it's split down the middle for some reason. So if you're like,

759
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,650
Speaker 4:  you want to watch a video on your watch. It's like split in the middle, which

760
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,480
Speaker 4:  is incredible. This is one of the,

761
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,960
Speaker 1:  Those patents were like, you know, I've spent a lot of my life

762
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,900
Speaker 1:  covering patent. I looked at this one, I was like, shouldn't the patent examiner

763
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,770
Speaker 1:  sent this back with like, you gotta try harder. Like literally the drawing

764
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,670
Speaker 1:  is like a watch and two fingers and the fingers unpinched in the watch gets

765
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,090
Speaker 1:  bigger. And it's like kinda, it's like an eight year old could have come

766
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,020
Speaker 1:  up with this guy.

767
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,750
Speaker 4:  I also watched iron man too. Come on.

768
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,990
Speaker 1:  I'm sure it is a much more complete Baton obligation. It just those first

769
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:55,680
Speaker 1:  few pictures,

770
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,240
Speaker 6:  The way it rendered for like fours on

771
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,230
Speaker 6:  half of the screen and then just the ax on the other. This

772
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,650
Speaker 6:  is incredible. I like, I love that. They were like, yeah, sure.

773
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:08,700
Speaker 6:  Patent go

774
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,700
Speaker 4:  Movies. Don't ever put stuff in the middle of the picture. It's always on

775
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,770
Speaker 4:  the left and the right. So of course, you know,

776
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,390
Speaker 1:  Well then you just started talking about how it rendered Thor with no explanation

777
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,150
Speaker 1:  of the fact that one of the patent images is a Thor.

778
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,140
Speaker 6:  This is one of the patent images is a Thor. I didn't just like

779
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,670
Speaker 6:  have that idea. I've already seen it. It's great.

780
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,150
Speaker 6:  Thor's on

781
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,810
Speaker 1:  Very good. But you got it. These pictures are just, it's like, think

782
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,960
Speaker 4:  So the last gadget is the thing that should be cool. But instead it's a

783
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,350
Speaker 4:  disappointment. Jen reviewed it. It's the echo show

784
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,650
Speaker 4:  15, which is like the final form of what the echo show should have been,

785
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,720
Speaker 4:  which is a picture frame. But

786
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,050
Speaker 4:  it's got this widget system, which is not great. Like the

787
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,890
Speaker 4:  smart home controls are really not great. And also it's got this new

788
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:02,490
Speaker 4:  fancy, Amazon custom bespoke processor in it,

789
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,370
Speaker 1:  But it's still slow. That's unforgivable. Come on.

790
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,850
Speaker 6:  What I'm looking at? Like I'm looking at one of the pictures she took and

791
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,580
Speaker 6:  I'm looking at the widgets and the buttons look like they were designed in

792
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,270
Speaker 6:  2007. Like yeah. The UI is just

793
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,660
Speaker 1:  Ugly. It's funny. We were talking about fridges last week. Like it looks

794
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,650
Speaker 1:  like the Samsung fridge UI. Yeah. Like this is

795
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,680
Speaker 1:  what a Samsung smart fridge tablet looks like. And it's like, I don't know

796
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,890
Speaker 1:  today, Amazon knock at the memo that they did not set the world on fire with

797
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,850
Speaker 1:  smart fridges. Like I don't, I don't know. The photo thing is

798
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,780
Speaker 1:  really interesting because we had Dave, Dave limp on decoder and I was like,

799
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,950
Speaker 1:  Alexa, like the thing holding me out of that ecosystem is that Google

800
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,730
Speaker 1:  photos is better than Amazon photos. He was like, Amazon photos are slips

801
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:48,540
Speaker 1:  me a week later. Great. At keeping the cards close a week

802
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,990
Speaker 1:  later, Amazon launched a huge update. Tam is on photos iOS only.

803
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,830
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So the app on Iowa. Cause that's, if you think about this, the most

804
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,800
Speaker 1:  important place, like most of your photos on your phone, if you've got iOS

805
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,710
Speaker 1:  app, you're doing the auto import. Great. Now you can feed them to Alexa

806
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,220
Speaker 1:  devices. So, okay. The first bits and bobs of this

807
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,520
Speaker 1:  are coming together, we're going to compete with Google photos, but then

808
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,450
Speaker 1:  it's slow. It's like you might as well just get a digital photo frame at

809
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,200
Speaker 1:  that point. Like you're still doing better than having a slow computer on

810
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:16,530
Speaker 1:  your wall.

811
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,730
Speaker 4:  Well, so here's my thing. Like Amazon is trying very hard to create the

812
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,360
Speaker 4:  ambient OS. Right. But trying to make ambient computing, they're even trying

813
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,030
Speaker 4:  to like move beyond the whole concept of OSTP in the first place and just

814
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,490
Speaker 4:  have it be ambient computing. But there's a step in the

815
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,790
Speaker 4:  middle before you get there where like people still need

816
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,270
Speaker 4:  screens and they need to do stuff on those screens and they need the stuff

817
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,750
Speaker 4:  that they do in those screens to connect to the rest of their life and connect

818
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:44,380
Speaker 4:  to their phone. And I don't know how often you

819
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,190
Speaker 4:  interact with the Alexa app on your phone, but it's not

820
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,090
Speaker 4:  fun. And you know, there's like shopping lists here. And like, there's

821
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:55,990
Speaker 4:  like we mentioned the pictures, there's the widgets for your smart home.

822
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,920
Speaker 4:  There's like all of this stuff that looks like it's connected

823
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,850
Speaker 4:  to a whole and complete ecosystem in the way that, you know,

824
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,810
Speaker 4:  an iPad is, or even an Android tablet might be, but it's not,

825
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:11,800
Speaker 4:  it's all like a veneer. It's the veneer of an ecosystem with a bunch

826
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,490
Speaker 4:  of widgets on it. It's not an actual ecosystem unless you are

827
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,330
Speaker 4:  willing to bring your whole family in and use

828
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,090
Speaker 4:  the Lexa app to do all your stuff.

829
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,140
Speaker 1:  I, I would say like, I would be more offended by this. If

830
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,550
Speaker 1:  the product was good, you know what I mean? Like it's a giant, slow

831
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,110
Speaker 1:  picture frame. Yeah.

832
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:32,830
Speaker 4:  Like

833
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,730
Speaker 1:  Short, like of course the software is kind of, I can't keep it. Like, that's

834
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,030
Speaker 1:  why I, it's just weird that Amazon, this is true.

835
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,360
Speaker 1:  I'll offer this criticism to Google too. They, they just put out that new

836
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,350
Speaker 1:  Google nest hub, Mia, like same design, new processor. They told

837
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:51,040
Speaker 1:  us still pretty slow. And now they're like, Google is adding, there's like

838
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,670
Speaker 1:  a browser on that thing. But you can just open web pages.

839
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,110
Speaker 1:  There's an apps doc. And it's like, guys, you did not design these to be

840
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:03,070
Speaker 1:  computers in this way. Like you are overtaxing

841
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,300
Speaker 1:  the hardware here, but turning them into baby iPad, plugged

842
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,540
Speaker 1:  into the wall. Yeah. Also they're plugged into the wall. Why not put faster

843
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:14,170
Speaker 1:  chips in them. Right. And like, we're just kind of like, it seems like

844
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,980
Speaker 1:  they can't sell you a tablet. They know they can't sell you a tablet. Yeah.

845
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,280
Speaker 4:  And actually just reviewed a couple of chromo S tablets. And they're like,

846
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,790
Speaker 4:  they're they, they haven't gotten there yet. They're not there. You should

847
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,130
Speaker 4:  still do like Chromecast is great. Kronos tablets are not,

848
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:31,660
Speaker 1:  Let's make these weird crappy tablets out of our smart

849
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,290
Speaker 1:  home displays. Yeah. Is where they're going. And it just doesn't make any

850
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,160
Speaker 1:  sense to me. Well,

851
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,150
Speaker 6:  So cheap. Like, I mean, I guess yeah, they have to be cheap. Right? It's

852
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,870
Speaker 6:  Amazon's whole thing is undercutting everybody else, but it's just

853
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,710
Speaker 6:  like, looks like so cheaply made, it's got the, the super

854
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,100
Speaker 6:  slow processor and then it's just like zero effort.

855
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:55,270
Speaker 6:  And, and there's the other side of it, right? There's the really, really,

856
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,200
Speaker 6:  really nice, super expensive billionaires. Have

857
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,190
Speaker 6:  it in their home, like what? This is aping and isn't the Cantor just be

858
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,830
Speaker 6:  something in the middle for people who don't want to spend

859
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,850
Speaker 6:  no money on a garbage piece of technology. Like

860
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,030
Speaker 1:  I would say this stuff, the billionaires have on there, the loss of their

861
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,040
Speaker 1:  homes is it's actually worse.

862
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:20,200
Speaker 1:  Like have you ever like encountered one of those systems? I have a friend

863
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,780
Speaker 1:  who he used to install them and he was like, they're all intentionally designed

864
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,710
Speaker 1:  broken so that our service contracts are more lucrative. Like

865
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,170
Speaker 1:  it's like pretty brutal, but they're billionaires, whatever, just like milk.

866
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,350
Speaker 1:  And they don't care. It's a good business model. It's good work. If you get

867
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:36,440
Speaker 1:  it, we got to take a break. But then we're going to come back. And Deidre

868
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,030
Speaker 1:  has promised that we'll be sad about software updates.

Speaker 1:  We're back.

897
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,130
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I front-loaded the fun stuff. And now we're going to have some sad

898
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,650
Speaker 4:  stuff. It was just suffer updates. Merry Christmas,

899
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:30,980
Speaker 1:  Everyone.

900
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,680
Speaker 4:  Well, we'll say we'll have some fun at the end. We'll have a lighting round.

901
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,670
Speaker 4:  It'll be okay. So apple got out a bunch of its false stuff. So

902
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,630
Speaker 4:  iOS 15 dot two with the app privacy report. And

903
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,410
Speaker 4:  some weirdness was, see Sam universal is still Mia on

904
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,250
Speaker 4:  Monterrey, but you can do share play now. Hooray. And

905
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,210
Speaker 4:  then, I don't know, like Google put out a massive update for the pixel six,

906
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,000
Speaker 4:  but it still hasn't arrived on a bunch of here, at least here in the U S

907
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:00,320
Speaker 4:  one. Plus had the pull it's O S update for oxygen O S

908
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,470
Speaker 4:  12, just had they, did. They just screwed it up.

909
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,270
Speaker 4:  I think that everyone needs to take a beat on your big software

910
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:12,020
Speaker 4:  updates. Just like, hold them back a little bit

911
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,170
Speaker 4:  longer. Don't announce features till you can ship them. Don't

912
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,550
Speaker 4:  do this, this, this fall in particular. I

913
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:22,760
Speaker 4:  expected, you know, I expected a little bit of chaos

914
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,790
Speaker 4:  last year from COVID and everyone learning how to work remote or whatever,

915
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,960
Speaker 4:  but the fact that we've had so many major OS updates this fall

916
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,310
Speaker 4:  just go sideways. Yeah. Is infuriating. And

917
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:39,090
Speaker 4:  I don't know, I don't have it like a thesis here other than

918
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,110
Speaker 4:  I am seeing similar stories across apple

919
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,880
Speaker 4:  and Android. So

920
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,570
Speaker 1:  Can I, oh, here's my shot in the dark. Okay. I am like a huge proponent of

921
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,290
Speaker 1:  remote work. So don't take this the wrong way. These companies

922
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,280
Speaker 1:  are in like, kind of like open conflict with their employees. So return

923
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:59,610
Speaker 1:  to office, right. And apples are turned certainly as hardware employees,

924
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:03,450
Speaker 1:  but the we're seeing like here's the fruits of 19 months of

925
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:07,140
Speaker 1:  remote software development. I just like, I honestly wonder if

926
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,620
Speaker 1:  maintaining that relentless yearly updates

927
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,550
Speaker 1:  schedule and maybe it's not just being remote. Maybe it's the stress of the

928
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:18,420
Speaker 1:  pandemic. Like I wonder if maybe they shouldn't have eased up on the

929
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,960
Speaker 1:  aggressiveness of the yearly update schedule to just account for the fact

930
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,350
Speaker 1:  that their workforces are totally distributed now. Yeah. I mean, I I've no

931
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:28,950
Speaker 1:  science behind this and I don't think apple engineers still go back to the

932
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,940
Speaker 1:  office or whatever. I'm just saying like, it's, you can see those

933
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,550
Speaker 1:  two things may be colliding in this being a result. Yeah.

934
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:39,030
Speaker 6:  I was going to say it like apple had already struggled with this, but also

935
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,930
Speaker 6:  I want to point out there is one company that had a major update just like

936
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:46,080
Speaker 6:  last week to all of its Android

937
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:50,160
Speaker 6:  tablets that may be run on E ink. And it was wonderful.

938
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,060
Speaker 6:  It's beautiful.

939
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:54,750
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That's four people work there. They probably all just got on a zoom

940
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,680
Speaker 1:  and wrote it together.

941
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:59,940
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it was beautiful. I love it. So not everybody is

942
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,650
Speaker 6:  screwed up their updates this year,

943
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,260
Speaker 1:  There is a little concert. This SI something that you mentioned with apple,

944
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,290
Speaker 1:  there's some controversy that they changed the web pages and maybe it was

945
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,220
Speaker 1:  going away. Apple tells us Nope. Still coming.

946
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,310
Speaker 1:  They're still working on it. Still collecting feedback. So yeah. We'll see

947
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,300
Speaker 1:  if that happens. The other part, I mean, I was 15 is missing a

948
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,780
Speaker 1:  lot of features. Right. They're slowly rolling them out. Universal control.

949
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,680
Speaker 1:  Not being there. This is like a highlight feature of all of it. And

950
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,550
Speaker 1:  there's still, we don't know some spring, which is a long time away.

951
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,220
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I really want it. It's like a great

952
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,850
Speaker 1:  Feature. The end of spring is like, now you're starting to start thinking

953
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:39,600
Speaker 1:  about Iowa 16 on this cadence, for sure. Right. The end of

954
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,440
Speaker 1:  spring rolls you is pretty close to June, which is when they will announce

955
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,610
Speaker 1:  Iowa 16. Yeah.

956
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,720
Speaker 6:  It's just like, wouldn't the Mac book air. Like the second generation Mac

957
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,530
Speaker 6:  book air is going to be coming out and also finally universal control.

958
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah. There's this moment that has become lore

959
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:00,450
Speaker 4:  amongst people that have watched apple keynotes over the years and I'm forgetting

960
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,900
Speaker 4:  the last, was it snow leopard? The snow leopard. Yeah. Where they got out

961
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,480
Speaker 4:  and they're like, all right, here are the new features. This year are none

962
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,170
Speaker 4:  just bug fixes and speed improvements. And like the crowd

963
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,680
Speaker 4:  erupted in. Cheers. Yeah. And I'm just saying

964
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:17,700
Speaker 4:  20, 22 blank check to every major software

965
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,280
Speaker 4:  company redo that keynote,

966
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,880
Speaker 4:  Microsoft, apple, Google company that makes

967
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,630
Speaker 4:  Alex's weirdo E ink tablet. They did a great job this

968
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:32,590
Speaker 4:  year. Come out and say, all we're doing this year is clean and stuff up.

969
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:37,000
Speaker 4:  That's it like Microsoft just come on me. You know what? The settings

970
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,640
Speaker 4:  and the control panels thing. Yeah. W we're we've been, you know, we've been

971
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,850
Speaker 4:  working on it. It's w it's fixed. They're all in one place now. And that's

972
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,630
Speaker 4:  the only feature we're shipping. Yeah. All apple needs to do is like ship

973
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,560
Speaker 4:  the features they promise last year and bug fixes blank check. Do it.

974
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,340
Speaker 1:  I always thinking about the local news test of the apple keynote. Like,

975
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,940
Speaker 1:  what thing are they going to announce that breaks through to like the local

976
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,510
Speaker 1:  news or the today show or whatever. Yeah. And they're kind of like out

977
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,170
Speaker 1:  like universal control they'll ship. And like, can you just imagine you're

978
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:08,890
Speaker 1:  like a local news anchor being like, and now you can wave an iPad at your

979
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:09,520
Speaker 1:  laptop,

980
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,750
Speaker 1:  but if they're apple announces, we're taking a year off to

981
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,860
Speaker 1:  clean up all the bugs. Like literally every local news, like the today show

982
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,820
Speaker 1:  we'll do the full hour. Yeah. On apple said, they're just going to fix

983
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,180
Speaker 1:  the iPhone. And like, you can just see it. Like, it's like an earned victory

984
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,000
Speaker 1:  for them. Yeah. All right. They're never going to do it. Snow leopard was

985
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,030
Speaker 1:  the best sauce ever made. I still think about it with way I was at, I was

986
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,730
Speaker 1:  taking our trash to the, I live in the woods. So I take my own trash to the

987
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,910
Speaker 1:  dump and they have a, they have like a shed, like the electronics recycling

988
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:43,540
Speaker 1:  shed. Yeah. And they had like an original I book in there

989
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,960
Speaker 1:  who, and I was like, I should take this home and run snow leopard.

990
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:54,010
Speaker 4:  The other software stuff I wanted to talk about is two things happened.

991
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,700
Speaker 4:  Adobe launched creative cloud express, which is a,

992
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,420
Speaker 4:  like a light version of its editing tools. And then

993
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,410
Speaker 4:  snap launched story studio, which is a standalone

994
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,670
Speaker 4:  video editing app for phones. And I feel like

995
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,660
Speaker 4:  the cycle of everybody realizing, oh God, Tik TOK is a video editing

996
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,110
Speaker 4:  app. And we need to catch up to that. But we don't know quite how. And like

997
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,530
Speaker 4:  what's, how's it connect to our social network or not is going to be hitting.

998
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,280
Speaker 4:  And it's going to be hitting in waves over the next year or so

999
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,640
Speaker 4:  I'm not going to bring us back around to apple clips, although I really want

1000
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,510
Speaker 4:  to, but I don't know, like I'm excited to see another

1001
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:35,380
Speaker 4:  shot from other companies besides tech talk at innovating

1002
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,040
Speaker 4:  on the like mobile editing workflow. Despite the fact that

1003
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,250
Speaker 4:  inherently, when I see Adobe announced a light version of its software, I

1004
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:46,240
Speaker 4:  hate it. Cause I've used a bunch of their, like the way they used to

1005
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,780
Speaker 4:  think about mobile software there, you know, elements or whatever the heck

1006
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,770
Speaker 4:  they used to call that stuff. It was terrible. I believe Adobe can get

1007
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:57,700
Speaker 4:  it better now because they seem to have a clear

1008
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,630
Speaker 4:  mindset of how their stuff works on multiple platforms and cloud and

1009
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,320
Speaker 4:  whatever. But yeah, I dunno. I think it's

1010
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,280
Speaker 4:  time to, to have a little bit more innovation in like the UI

1011
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,180
Speaker 4:  of video editing. I think Tik TOK has definitely led the way, but we are

1012
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:17,120
Speaker 4:  like, we need something that feels like, I dunno, we need like that

1013
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,770
Speaker 4:  movie moment, like where there's like a coherent, like, oh, I am rethinking

1014
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:24,560
Speaker 4:  how this thing works in a way that isn't sort of like tacked on tacked on

1015
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,300
Speaker 4:  tacked on and the way it was on Tik TOK and

1016
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,960
Speaker 1:  A little bit on reels. So I don't make a lot of tech talks. Yeah. It's not

1017
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,560
Speaker 1:  my thing. But I would argue that that movie moment

1018
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,070
Speaker 1:  actually already happened with Tech-Talk like the tick-tock video editor

1019
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:40,970
Speaker 1:  is complicated, but it works nothing like a premiere or whatever. It doesn't

1020
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,940
Speaker 1:  even work like a movie, which is right. No one understands

1021
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:48,890
Speaker 1:  it's its own thing. And like users have different expectations

1022
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:52,400
Speaker 1:  out of it. And I think that's part of partially what drove snapped to do

1023
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,360
Speaker 1:  this. Like yeah. The audience of tick-tock users and Snapchat users

1024
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,200
Speaker 1:  is a Venn diagram. Like there's perfect overlap. It's both young audiences

1025
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,290
Speaker 1:  is Alex. He will always remind us. Snapchat is very popular people like lots

1026
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:07,400
Speaker 1:  of people use it just doesn't get the attention of the other platforms. So

1027
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,270
Speaker 1:  snap making a tool that's better for, Tech-Talk just reinforces the

1028
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:15,230
Speaker 1:  affinity people already have for snap. Right. And I don't think snap is going

1029
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:18,680
Speaker 1:  to make a Tik TOK clone. I think they just want people to using its tools

1030
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,240
Speaker 1:  instead of thinking of Tik TOK is a creative place that then it gets

1031
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,870
Speaker 1:  shared out elsewhere. So I think there's value here. And I think the reason

1032
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:30,680
Speaker 1:  apple never got there with clips is like apple. Once you're

1033
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,580
Speaker 1:  done making the thing, apple is, there's no value

1034
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,490
Speaker 1:  to apple once they're done. Right. Right. It's just like, you're going to

1035
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:38,510
Speaker 1:  share it on Instagram or whatever. You

1036
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,580
Speaker 4:  Don't feel good about clips. The only person that feels good about clips

1037
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:40,970
Speaker 4:  is me.

1038
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,630
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But like, but they don't have like this big distribution network that

1039
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:48,290
Speaker 1:  is their business. Right. Whereas with Tik TOK, getting you to

1040
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,540
Speaker 1:  participate in the Tik TOK economy is great for tech

1041
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,430
Speaker 1:  business. So there's a huge incentive to make that video editor like

1042
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:56,660
Speaker 1:  fun to use. Yeah.

1043
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,320
Speaker 4:  Adobe doesn't have that ecosystem, but it seems like they're, they're starting

1044
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,190
Speaker 4:  to think about doing a better job with, with mobile and like

1045
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:04,370
Speaker 4:  that.

1046
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,630
Speaker 6:  I think they're only thinking about it because they have like a finite

1047
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,740
Speaker 6:  number based out, right? Like they have professionals,

1048
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,550
Speaker 6:  all of these young people and stuff no longer are going to go and buy

1049
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:20,060
Speaker 6:  Photoshop. They're not going to go buy premiere. They never would have to

1050
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,960
Speaker 6:  begin with, but like, they're going to go pirate or they're going to go

1051
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:28,220
Speaker 6:  get the gimp has a gimp Blake free

1052
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:32,210
Speaker 6:  Photoshop. Like they need this younger audience that actively hates

1053
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:35,870
Speaker 6:  them because of the last, like how

1054
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,530
Speaker 6:  difficult they've made the path to entry into Photoshop and

1055
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:43,160
Speaker 6:  premiere. Like they actively hate them. And this is like, oh yeah, we can

1056
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,940
Speaker 6:  go for them. Even though it's I guess it's mainly this new

1057
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,330
Speaker 6:  software suite is mainly geared for like social media managers.

1058
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:54,590
Speaker 1:  So Scott Belsky was on declutter just recently. And

1059
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:58,550
Speaker 1:  like that's where Adobe lives, right? Like Adobe is search to finish

1060
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:02,450
Speaker 1:  a commercial operation. Right. Social there. Their

1061
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,690
Speaker 1:  big competitors are not necessarily tech stock. Although it takes out, creates

1062
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,480
Speaker 1:  the paradigms for the tools that Adobe has to live in. So they're very aware

1063
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,410
Speaker 1:  they need to participate. So they know, but their competition

1064
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:16,400
Speaker 1:  is Figma and Canva. Right? You are, you own a

1065
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:20,490
Speaker 1:  flower shop and you want to do some Facebook ads. What tools are you gonna

1066
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:24,360
Speaker 1:  use to make your, your Facebook ads? Adobe wants it to be their tools,

1067
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,530
Speaker 1:  right? Like that's, that's where they live is like the second you become

1068
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:31,800
Speaker 1:  a business. Adobe is like a hundred bucks a month.

1069
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,670
Speaker 1:  Where else are you going to go? Yep. Here we are. And I,

1070
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,450
Speaker 1:  I think that's the line for them. Although that that whole interview is fascinating.

1071
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,840
Speaker 1:  It's fascinating. But I, I do think they're not,

1072
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,800
Speaker 1:  they're not chasing teens need to care about Photoshop. They're they're

1073
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,100
Speaker 1:  chasing the second you graduate to, this is revenue.

1074
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,170
Speaker 1:  You're going to move to Adobe stools.

1075
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,380
Speaker 6:  Right. Are you going to move to them on your phone?

1076
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,020
Speaker 1:  No. You're gonna move to them onto your iPad. Yeah.

1077
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:02,370
Speaker 6:  But like a less good version than what you can get on a

1078
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:05,400
Speaker 6:  computer. I don't know. I just feels like they still haven't answered. Like

1079
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:06,750
Speaker 6:  they still haven't solved the problem.

1080
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,790
Speaker 1:  What is a computer Alex? Yes.

1081
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:13,770
Speaker 6:  They haven't solved the problem of lake. The difference

1082
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:17,130
Speaker 6:  between Photoshop and premiere on a computer or a

1083
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,520
Speaker 6:  laptop, excuse me, you know, something with an x86

1084
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,000
Speaker 6:  processor and, and mobile based stuff.

1085
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,960
Speaker 1:  Oh, they've saw that problem with a format of file format called cloud PSD,

1086
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,110
Speaker 1:  which is a lot like

1087
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:36,600
Speaker 4:  One, one last offer up thing. Speaking of like software updates, actually

1088
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,950
Speaker 4:  like spare a thought for, since admins around you, because

1089
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:44,610
Speaker 4:  this log forge bug is not bug

1090
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,630
Speaker 4:  vulnerability. It's out of control. And I, I actually don't have any

1091
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,480
Speaker 4:  interesting things to say about it. I'm happy that CloudFlare is like trying

1092
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,380
Speaker 4:  to block it off at a system level there. But

1093
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:58,350
Speaker 1:  Yeah, you're happy about it. You're happy that there's a centralized gatekeeper

1094
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:02,250
Speaker 1:  on the internet. Who's like, we're just going to fix it, man. That cuts both

1095
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:02,370
Speaker 1:  ways.

1096
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,610
Speaker 4:  It's rough. Right. But this is one of these levels of catastrophe or

1097
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:10,470
Speaker 4:  it's so big that it's impossible to wrap your head around because it's

1098
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:14,010
Speaker 4:  big, but it's also like slow moving. So there's not like

1099
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:17,550
Speaker 4:  an immediate, like, oh my God, this thing is broken. And I feel it right

1100
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:21,240
Speaker 4:  now, or this hack just happened. Like this was the exact effect of it is

1101
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,320
Speaker 4:  this fundamental piece of Java is like

1102
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:29,760
Speaker 4:  broken and there's fixes for it. But it's going to take a long time. And

1103
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,720
Speaker 4:  in the meantime, it's trivially easy to attack. And so get

1104
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,930
Speaker 4:  ready for bad stuff. Question mark period. Yeah.

1105
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:40,500
Speaker 1:  And I will say it's a great time for us to hire a new senior security report.

1106
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,390
Speaker 1:  Our corn faith corn's did a great job.

1107
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,820
Speaker 1:  Like literally I was like, wow, just in the Nick of time. Yeah. So Corrine's

1108
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:51,780
Speaker 1:  headline is a lot forward is patched. The exploits are just

1109
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:55,680
Speaker 1:  getting started. Right. So we'll see. But, and

1110
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,520
Speaker 1:  by the way, this is like open source contributors choosing to work

1111
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,510
Speaker 1:  nights and weekends to fix this thing. The internet is a wild place.

1112
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,810
Speaker 1:  Like on the one hand CloudFare is like, we'll just stop it like

1113
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:10,920
Speaker 1:  between you and everything is us. So we'll stop it. And on the other hand,

1114
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,980
Speaker 1:  it's like, we're a loose collection of volunteers and we'll fix it.

1115
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,280
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And like the dynamic between those parts of the internet is

1116
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:21,820
Speaker 1:  I always think about it when things like this come up, it is underexplored

1117
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,090
Speaker 1:  I think,

1118
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,600
Speaker 4:  All right. We should do like two lightening round things. I don't know. I

1119
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,470
Speaker 4:  mean, I made a bunch of lists of stuff here. I personally want to ask

1120
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:33,400
Speaker 4:  why, when designing the cyber truck, Elon Musk didn't think of the fact

1121
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,330
Speaker 4:  that it would need a windshield wiper. And so instead it has one that's like

1122
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:37,810
Speaker 4:  eight feet long.

1123
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:41,650
Speaker 1:  There's a video of the cyber track testing. Yeah. I will

1124
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:45,610
Speaker 1:  say that it looks sick, right? Like it just it's a

1125
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:49,120
Speaker 1:  triangle car. I can't, they actually went and built a

1126
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:52,510
Speaker 1:  stainless steel triangle car. Like, yeah, it's cool.

1127
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,020
Speaker 6:  It looks,

1128
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,000
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's like tank wars, but in real life, it's great. The first one

1129
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,310
Speaker 1:  That was too big, by the way. So they were always saying, we got to scale

1130
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:03,790
Speaker 1:  this down. It's clear. They didn't think about what scaling

1131
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:07,870
Speaker 1:  down would mean. And like complying with road laws

1132
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:11,710
Speaker 1:  would mean. So even in the scale down version, it's got the

1133
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:15,130
Speaker 1:  three lights across the front. That mean it's an extra wide 80 inch car,

1134
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,370
Speaker 1:  like big pickup trucks have those lights. So it's got those. They didn't

1135
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,270
Speaker 1:  think about where to Mount the actual headlights. So the headlights are like

1136
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:26,050
Speaker 1:  at the bottom of the, you can't even call it a F it's the

1137
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:30,010
Speaker 1:  front of the triangle. Like, I don't know what else you'd call the flat

1138
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:33,010
Speaker 1:  front of the wedge of the car that lights are at the bottom.

1139
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:37,360
Speaker 1:  It's got side mirrors that look ridiculous. And even Ilan on Twitter was

1140
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:41,260
Speaker 1:  like, I am, we have to ship the side mirrors, but people can

1141
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:45,190
Speaker 1:  do other things. And she needs to take off the side,

1142
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:49,030
Speaker 1:  which is a horrible idea, but maybe we could replace on the cameras. And

1143
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:53,020
Speaker 1:  then this wiper, which is just a huge ass wiper, the

1144
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:56,950
Speaker 1:  size of the windshield. And I like, I know he

1145
01:06:56,950 --> 01:07:00,670
Speaker 1:  was responding someone else, but he was like, the wipers is what troubles

1146
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:04,510
Speaker 1:  me the most about the whole triangle car. And it's like,

1147
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:08,770
Speaker 1:  man, that is an incredible list of priorities. But like I made

1148
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:11,650
Speaker 1:  a triangle car. Here's the problem, the wiper number one on the list. And

1149
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:15,340
Speaker 1:  it's like, there are many other questions. Yeah. I've been saying this to

1150
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:19,120
Speaker 1:  Andy and Sean, our transportation reporters for awhile. Like we are just

1151
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:23,020
Speaker 1:  in this incredible vaporware moment with EVs. Yep. Everything is

1152
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:26,950
Speaker 1:  vapor. And so the cyber truck was extremely vapor for awhile.

1153
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:30,730
Speaker 1:  It's cool to see it running around on a track, but you see all of the

1154
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:34,480
Speaker 1:  problems from the initial design to reality

1155
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,290
Speaker 1:  expressed in this video, including the swiper and the wife. I mean, it just

1156
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:39,370
Speaker 1:  looks slightly ridiculous.

1157
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,330
Speaker 6:  It just feels like it's getting more and more to that Homer Simpson designed

1158
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:47,170
Speaker 6:  car. No, like I'm just waiting for the 64 ounce cup

1159
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:47,440
Speaker 6:  holder.

1160
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:51,640
Speaker 1:  The Homer did not have a vision. This thing has a vision. And it's what if

1161
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,810
Speaker 1:  the triangle was a car

1162
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,020
Speaker 6:  Slightly

1163
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:58,510
Speaker 1:  Better vision. I love it. Everyone should watch this video. That's great.

1164
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:58,930
Speaker 1:  Okay.

1165
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:01,960
Speaker 4:  Last thing in the lightning round, we touched on this, I believe before,

1166
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,890
Speaker 4:  but the fight between the FCC and the

1167
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:09,640
Speaker 4:  FAA over 5g at airports has gotten like

1168
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,010
Speaker 4:  to the point where they're just like sniping at each other.

1169
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,190
Speaker 1:  So this list, so a bunch of ex FCC wrote a letter

1170
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:20,180
Speaker 1:  being like the FAA is dumb. Yeah. Here's the

1171
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,600
Speaker 1:  list, Tom Wheeler Democrat mean unclimbed born

1172
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:26,930
Speaker 1:  Democrat, Juliana, Caskey, Democrat, GTE pie,

1173
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:31,400
Speaker 1:  Michael Powell. Like you've got like, it's just

1174
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,640
Speaker 1:  nuts. Like these are people who do not agree with each other. Like literally

1175
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,540
Speaker 1:  people who reversed each other as policies at the FCCS

1176
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,260
Speaker 1:  immediately upon taking office. And they're all saying

1177
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,190
Speaker 1:  the FAA is overstepping their authority. The FAA position threatened to derail.

1178
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:50,150
Speaker 1:  The reason conclusions reached by the FTC FCC after years of technical

1179
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:53,420
Speaker 1:  analysis and study nuts. Yeah.

1180
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,890
Speaker 6:  The FAA saying that like 5g will destroy plane.

1181
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,970
Speaker 4:  They're saying it'll make it harder for certain systems to automatically

1182
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:03,650
Speaker 4:  land the plane under certain conditions.

1183
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:07,310
Speaker 1:  Yes. There is an FAA study, sewing 5g interference with altimeters.

1184
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:12,290
Speaker 1:  But the argument is that many other countries have already approved this

1185
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,310
Speaker 1:  radio equipment in these bands, the spectrum bands. There's a

1186
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:20,300
Speaker 1:  great quote from Harold Feld, from public knowledge, old friend of the verge.

1187
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,410
Speaker 1:  And he's like either physics works differently. United States or the report

1188
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,780
Speaker 1:  at the center of this controversy needs to explain why interference hasn't

1189
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,920
Speaker 1:  shown up in any other country.

1190
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,640
Speaker 6:  It's it does work different

1191
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:35,150
Speaker 1:  Here, but you know, honestly, we'll turn the web here at the end of

1192
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:38,990
Speaker 1:  2021. You could probably convince me that we'll be able to see birds. Aren't

1193
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:42,890
Speaker 1:  real. Yeah. All right. This is a good one. Yeah. For

1194
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,790
Speaker 1:  last of the year,

1195
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:47,060
Speaker 4:  We haven't complained at all about the fact that Toyota is making remote

1196
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:50,630
Speaker 4:  start from a key fob. Part of a subscription service. I think cellular radios

1197
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,440
Speaker 4:  were a mistake.

1198
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,980
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Anytime you add a radio on a chip, someone is like, what if you pay

1199
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,070
Speaker 1:  me some money every month? That's the future of all technology

1200
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:02,540
Speaker 1:  soon to be the future of, you know, like what was the last

1201
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,110
Speaker 1:  semester refrigerators like anything where there's like a

1202
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:09,890
Speaker 1:  server on the other end that might do stuff. They're like, what if we, you

1203
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:12,710
Speaker 1:  paid us to use the server? Yeah. It's going to happen.

1204
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:17,510
Speaker 1:  That's my prediction for 2022, the rebellion against the

1205
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,410
Speaker 1:  services revenue.

1206
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,620
Speaker 4:  My prediction is no more software features for the whole year.

1207
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,190
Speaker 1:  Oh, that'd be so great. Oh, that'd be so great. If your prediction was right

1208
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:29,030
Speaker 1:  and mine is wrong. That's my hope for you. Anyway. It's

1209
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:32,720
Speaker 1:  been a great year. Return 10 this year. Thank you all for participating.

1210
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,060
Speaker 1:  We're going to take a couple weeks off. I hope you get some rest. Get to

1211
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:38,540
Speaker 1:  hang out with your families. You can send us nice sweets at the end of the

1212
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:41,930
Speaker 1:  day. If you want to. Dieter is at backlog. Alex is Alex H Crans

1213
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:45,560
Speaker 1:  Lauren is at Lauren Rush. I'm at reckless. We'd love to hear from you. I

1214
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:49,550
Speaker 1:  want to call it just a handful of stories right at the end here, Sean. O'Kane

1215
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,280
Speaker 1:  congratulations, Sean. You just took a big new job at Bloomberg, but he has

1216
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:56,210
Speaker 1:  his last big feature about an Evie startup. They're all vapor.

1217
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,990
Speaker 1:  I'm telling you ed startup called  with Jay change with

1218
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:03,770
Speaker 1:  Jay. It's really good. It's got everything. It's got, it starts with Iowasca

1219
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:08,000
Speaker 1:  and it just like goes from there. We ran a great story

1220
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,600
Speaker 1:  about singing's the board ape yacht club party. It's just really good. It's

1221
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,760
Speaker 1:  just such an incredible story. You'd have to go read it. It reads like,

1222
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:19,380
Speaker 1:  like old school, nineties tech writing. If you know I'm talking it's it's

1223
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,290
Speaker 1:  just got a vibe to it. It's really fun. And then Jen, who you mentioned earlier,

1224
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:26,220
Speaker 1:  wrote three gigantic pieces on matter, the new standard. She did verge house

1225
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:29,850
Speaker 1:  with Dieter about it. It's great. It's really fun. Tony. Fidel's like all

1226
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,750
Speaker 1:  over the big feature. Just excitedly talking about how he had the right idea

1227
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:37,620
Speaker 1:  as thread was his idea. It's A-plus definitely was

1228
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:41,130
Speaker 1:  reading. Okay. We've got a couple more decoders in the new year, but other

1229
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,220
Speaker 1:  than that, the verge cast is off. So we'll see you in

1230
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:47,280
Speaker 1:  2022. That's it. Rock roll. Happy new
