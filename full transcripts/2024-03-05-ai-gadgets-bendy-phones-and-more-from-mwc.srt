00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:06,605
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Region Locked Phones.

3
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:10,645
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I am standing outside of the Alamo Draft

4
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:14,565
Speaker 2:  house where I just saw Dune part two. Now I don't know if I'm like the expert

5
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:18,365
Speaker 2:  on whether Dune movies are any good. I saw part one just the other day

6
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:22,765
Speaker 2:  on an iPad, on a train. I haven't read the books. Love the first

7
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:26,525
Speaker 2:  movie. Loved the second movie. It's really long. It's really intense. It's

8
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:30,325
Speaker 2:  really loud. I had a great time. Everybody should go see it. Ideally on

9
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:34,005
Speaker 2:  the biggest screen you can possibly find, but Dune is not what we are here

10
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:37,365
Speaker 2:  to talk about on The Vergecast today. Today we're talking about Mobile World

11
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:41,605
Speaker 2:  Congress MWC is one of those trade shows that some years is

12
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:44,765
Speaker 2:  kind of boring. It's just a bunch of companies being like, look on Android

13
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:48,605
Speaker 2:  phone. And some years is really interesting. And this year was one of those

14
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:52,005
Speaker 2:  interesting years. So we are gonna have John Porter and Allison Johnson,

15
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:55,845
Speaker 2:  two Verge reporters who were at the show in Barcelona over the past week

16
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:59,805
Speaker 2:  and they're gonna tell us about all the interesting gadgets they saw and

17
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:03,285
Speaker 2:  maybe whether we got a hint of what The future of gadgets

18
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:07,005
Speaker 2:  really looks like. All that's coming up in just a sec, but first

19
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:11,205
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna go home and sleep for a bit because it's really late because that

20
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:15,005
Speaker 2:  is a three hour long movie. Then we'll get to it. This is The

21
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,245
Speaker 2:  Vergecast. See you in a sec.

22
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:43,975
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. I got some sleep. I'm now deep in the dune

23
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:47,295
Speaker 2:  behind the scenes YouTube rabbit hole. I've learned a lot of fun facts about

24
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:51,255
Speaker 2:  Austin Butler's hair. Let's get into the show. So Mobile World

25
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:55,455
Speaker 2:  Congress is, I would say typically the second most interesting trade show

26
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:59,055
Speaker 2:  of the year, at least most years. CES is the big one in Las Vegas

27
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:03,085
Speaker 2:  for the whole electronics and tech industry. But MWC has for

28
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:07,005
Speaker 2:  years had kind of a special niche as a place that is all

29
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:10,885
Speaker 2:  about one thing and that one thing is obviously mobile. Often

30
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:14,685
Speaker 2:  that just means lots and lots of phones and this year it meant that too.

31
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:19,085
Speaker 2:  But the thing about mobile right now is that the definition of

32
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:22,845
Speaker 2:  that word is starting to change. So thanks to ai

33
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:26,765
Speaker 2:  we're getting new kinds of devices altogether and because Apple and

34
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:30,725
Speaker 2:  Google have so thoroughly dominated the smartphone era, there are lots

35
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:34,525
Speaker 2:  of companies that are looking to figure out what's next. Even in the smartphone

36
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:38,245
Speaker 2:  world, the idea that your phone should just be a slab of glass that

37
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:41,405
Speaker 2:  runs a bunch of apps that come from an app store that's run by either Apple

38
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:45,325
Speaker 2:  or Google, there are so many good reasons for companies and for people

39
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,925
Speaker 2:  frankly to try and get past that idea. And so not only are we getting lots

40
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:52,805
Speaker 2:  of new phones, we're getting lots of new ideas about what a phone or a

41
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:56,685
Speaker 2:  mobile device in general should look like and how it can work and what

42
00:03:56,685 --> 00:04:00,605
Speaker 2:  it should mean in our lives. This is my kind of stuff to talk about so we're

43
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:03,685
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about it. The rgs, Allison Johnson and John Porter were both at

44
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:07,205
Speaker 2:  MWC last week. They played with all the devices and they tried to figure

45
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:10,765
Speaker 2:  out what they all say about The future of mobile and somewhat

46
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:14,765
Speaker 2:  miraculously they both made it home safe and not sick and they're here to

47
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:18,525
Speaker 2:  help me dig into all of it. Allison Johnson. Hello. Hello, John

48
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:20,125
Speaker 2:  Porter Welcome back to The Vergecast.

49
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:20,765
Speaker 6:  Hello.

50
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:25,245
Speaker 2:  So you guys survived. Yes. Tell us a little bit about what MWC is like. I

51
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:28,245
Speaker 2:  confess, it's been a bunch of years since I went and it's like in Barcelona.

52
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:32,405
Speaker 2:  So it seems very romantic and lovely in a way that like going to

53
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,845
Speaker 2:  Vegas for CES does not seem romantic and lovely. But like

54
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:40,165
Speaker 2:  give me the the 2024 vibe check of MWC this year.

55
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:44,645
Speaker 6:  So I read a lovely comment that referred to MWC as

56
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:48,605
Speaker 6:  a very nice overseas trip for this journalist And I, I read

57
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:52,525
Speaker 6:  that comment whilst sitting in a dingy hotel room with

58
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,325
Speaker 6:  a bathroom ceiling that was leaking at approximately

59
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:59,085
Speaker 6:  11:30 PM on a Saturday evening while I was just

60
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:02,885
Speaker 6:  writing my third embargo of the weekend. So I think that,

61
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,805
Speaker 6:  I think that kind of sums up maybe how glamorous, how glamorous MWC is,

62
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:10,005
Speaker 6:  but I mean like a lot of trade shows I think a lot of companies want to kind

63
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:13,885
Speaker 6:  of get out ahead of the show itself. So it means the weekend is

64
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:17,765
Speaker 6:  kind of filled with with these press events and you you kind of

65
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:21,645
Speaker 6:  end up kind of rushing from from one to the other to the other kinda

66
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:25,005
Speaker 6:  like barely keeping track of of what's happening because every single company's

67
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:28,885
Speaker 6:  just trying to jostle and not step on each other's toes too much but

68
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:32,605
Speaker 6:  maybe step on them a little bit and then the show kicks off on on Monday

69
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:35,925
Speaker 6:  in earnest and then it's just this frantic rush to to see the kind of the

70
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:39,485
Speaker 6:  smaller players that aren't able to hold a big press conference over the

71
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:42,645
Speaker 6:  course of the weekend and actually kind of get hands on time with with the

72
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:43,365
Speaker 6:  gadgets themselves.

73
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:47,485
Speaker 2:  Allison, what was your read? Was this your, this wasn't your first MWC was

74
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:47,645
Speaker 2:  it?

75
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:51,885
Speaker 7:  This was my first MWC. Oh it lived up to the hype I guess.

76
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:56,765
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I was surprised by how busy, yeah the weekend was. It was

77
00:05:56,765 --> 00:06:00,725
Speaker 7:  just like darting around Barcelona just to see different

78
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:04,405
Speaker 7:  stuff and just that added like difficulty level of like I don't

79
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,165
Speaker 7:  understand any of these street names but I'm gonna find this place where

80
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:11,765
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna look at a phone that bends. but it was great. It was, you can't

81
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:15,525
Speaker 7:  beat eating some meat and cheese in your hotel room at 1130

82
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,085
Speaker 7:  writing embargoes

83
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:20,565
Speaker 2:  Glamorous job we do. It really is, it really is. It did seem like

84
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:24,965
Speaker 2:  watching from afar not only kind of an unusually newsy show

85
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:28,565
Speaker 2:  but an unusually cool show in the sense that there was like

86
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:32,925
Speaker 2:  not just kind of the giant slew of all the phones that are kind of

87
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:37,085
Speaker 2:  the same as the other phones that MWC falls into every once in a while

88
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:40,285
Speaker 2:  where it's just like every company shows you their version of the same phone

89
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:43,885
Speaker 2:  that everybody else is making and there's 60,000 of them and that's MWC

90
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:47,405
Speaker 2:  this year it felt like there were some some big weird

91
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:51,565
Speaker 2:  swings in a way that I don't remember seeing in a while.

92
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,445
Speaker 2:  Is that, did it feel like that on the ground? Like was it cooler and more

93
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:57,125
Speaker 2:  exciting than, than maybe some of these we've had in recent years?

94
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:01,445
Speaker 7:  That was my impression. It was kind of a lot of running around to

95
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:04,965
Speaker 7:  see like weird little things like the Samsung Galaxy

96
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:09,005
Speaker 7:  ring was kind of out on display for the first time so we

97
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:13,125
Speaker 7:  got to go see that the Humane AI Pin was kind

98
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,925
Speaker 7:  of an unannounced guest appearance, so we got to see that

99
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:20,685
Speaker 7:  in action. I think the Deutsche Telecom booth, which

100
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:24,925
Speaker 7:  in the US is like T-Mobile, it's a very like T-Mobile

101
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:28,925
Speaker 7:  vibe of like everything was magenta, there were like blinking lights and

102
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:33,405
Speaker 7:  stadium seating and kind of like carnival ish. I was

103
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:37,245
Speaker 7:  like wow, this, this is really wild. So we

104
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:38,405
Speaker 7:  saw some cool stuff. Yeah,

105
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:42,565
Speaker 2:  I made a list of kind of the coolest gadgets that I

106
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,085
Speaker 2:  read about you guys seeing and I just wanna sort of run down your experiences

107
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:49,645
Speaker 2:  with a bunch of them and it seems to me that If, you were gonna pick one

108
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:52,925
Speaker 2:  that was kind of like the, the star of the show that everybody was talking

109
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:56,805
Speaker 2:  about. It feels to me like it's Lenovo's transparent laptop.

110
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,485
Speaker 2:  Do you think that's right? Is that the right answer?

111
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:03,205
Speaker 6:  I love Lenovo's transparent laptop. I can't articulate what I would

112
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:06,605
Speaker 6:  ever use it for. It filled me with joy hearing

113
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:10,325
Speaker 6:  Lenovo themselves trying to articulate why you would, what you would use

114
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:14,125
Speaker 6:  it for. But then that feels like a kind of part of the process with unveiling

115
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:17,045
Speaker 6:  a concept laptop like that you show this thing off to the world and a bunch

116
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:20,725
Speaker 6:  of people see it and a lot of people go, I don't know really what this

117
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:24,805
Speaker 6:  achieves, but then maybe like one person right in the back raises their hand

118
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:28,165
Speaker 6:  and goes like, what about and then you can take it back to your lab and kind

119
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:31,005
Speaker 6:  of like optimize it for that kind of like idea that that that just came up.

120
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:34,885
Speaker 6:  I will say Lenovo's big idea for this laptop, which If you haven't seen Firstly

121
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:39,045
Speaker 6:  go see it, it's a transparent micro LED display gets as bright as like

122
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:42,965
Speaker 6:  a thousand nets but it doesn't have a kind of a contrast layer. So that thing

123
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:46,605
Speaker 6:  is just transparent in a way that you can't control

124
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:49,845
Speaker 6:  when all the pixels are lit up, like when it's bright white. So If you say

125
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:53,685
Speaker 6:  had like a notepad open or something you can't see through that. But

126
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:56,730
Speaker 6:  kind of other than making the whole screen white, you kind of don't have,

127
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,325
Speaker 6:  don't have control over this thing.

128
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,765
Speaker 2:  So it doesn't have like the, there's that LG TV at CES that could sort of

129
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:05,325
Speaker 2:  roll up the thing behind it so that it would have something to, to contrast

130
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,685
Speaker 2:  against. This doesn't have that. It is just see through all the way,

131
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:11,165
Speaker 6:  It doesn't have that. A thing Lenovo told me when I asked was like, oh yeah,

132
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:13,725
Speaker 6:  we'll definitely try and include something like that if we this were ever

133
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:17,445
Speaker 6:  to make it to to production. But their idea for why you might want

134
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:21,045
Speaker 6:  this was they kind of had this artistic

135
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:24,325
Speaker 6:  idea for it that, oh, maybe you are an artist and you're sitting there and

136
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:28,165
Speaker 6:  you're sketching and you can see things behind it. So maybe you,

137
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:32,045
Speaker 6:  you put some sunflowers behind, behind the screen and then your

138
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,805
Speaker 6:  then, which then brings me onto the, the lower half of the tablet, which

139
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:38,725
Speaker 6:  is this kind of drawing tablet where when you bring a sty close to it,

140
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:42,925
Speaker 6:  the keyboard, the illuminated keyboard disappears and suddenly it's kind

141
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:46,605
Speaker 6:  of like a, a wack on surface type thing and then you can kind of sketch what's

142
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:50,565
Speaker 6:  behind the laptop, which I think would make sense if this thing

143
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:54,405
Speaker 6:  was the size of a TV like Lenovos thing. But when you're talking about I,

144
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:57,725
Speaker 6:  I forget exactly how big the screen is, I think it's maybe like 14, 15 inches.

145
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,525
Speaker 6:  You can just look around it. Like I, I don't know anyone out there that's

146
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:05,365
Speaker 6:  like hard oh are the unknowable joys of

147
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:08,165
Speaker 6:  what could be behind my laptop.

148
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:12,925
Speaker 6:  So Mike, my theory for who would buy this

149
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:15,925
Speaker 6:  thing if it did ever make it into production and like to be clear, they're

150
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:18,565
Speaker 6:  not making any promises about being into production. They were kind of confident

151
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:21,845
Speaker 6:  that the technology would maybe appear in a future product. But my guess

152
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:25,445
Speaker 6:  would be that this would be a thing for kind of really high end

153
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:29,685
Speaker 6:  front desks in like banks to buy and like the kind of place you, you

154
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:33,165
Speaker 6:  walk into and maybe nowadays they have an iMac 'cause they want, 'cause they

155
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,125
Speaker 6:  wanna project that air of high tech sophistication and maybe in The future

156
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:40,485
Speaker 6:  they go, Hey, check it out. We all look like we're minority report. Don't

157
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:44,245
Speaker 6:  you want to, you know, spend a bunch of money at at at this business? 'cause

158
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:47,485
Speaker 6:  it's a real, it's like a, it's a showy thing but I don't know

159
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:51,605
Speaker 6:  like where the practical element of of this thing

160
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:55,285
Speaker 6:  comes in. But I hope that, like I hope it starts the conversation the way

161
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:59,005
Speaker 6:  they hoped. And I hope that someone at the back is kind of now

162
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:02,845
Speaker 6:  thinking Ooh actually I have this perfect use case for, for a transparent

163
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:04,165
Speaker 6:  laptop display. Yeah,

164
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,725
Speaker 2:  I I appreciate that. With the whole transparent display

165
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:11,725
Speaker 2:  technology happening right now, nobody knows what to do with it except to

166
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:15,245
Speaker 2:  put it in fancy waiting rooms, which is so funny there and it's like there

167
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:18,565
Speaker 2:  the LGTV they were like, it could be, it could be a virtual fish tank at

168
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:21,645
Speaker 2:  your dentist's office and it's like, all right, like sure I'm down, let's

169
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:25,565
Speaker 2:  do it. I have, I have no issue with that. I also will never ever buy one

170
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,925
Speaker 2:  for my house. But I, I'm just honestly glad that

171
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:32,645
Speaker 2:  anyone is doing weird laptops. The world is better when there are weird

172
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:36,645
Speaker 2:  laptops and I appreciate Lenovo for not just making ThinkPads

173
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:38,645
Speaker 2:  but for also making weird laptops.

174
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:42,845
Speaker 6:  We should also point out that they're very sensible business laptops are

175
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,485
Speaker 6:  probably actually the more impactful announcement from the show. 'cause they,

176
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:49,165
Speaker 6:  they've kind of done a bunch of work with I Fixit to kind of make these things

177
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:52,005
Speaker 6:  more repairable. So I went through this cool demonstration with a couple

178
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:55,645
Speaker 6:  of I fixit guys who were kinda like pointing out all the kind of like the

179
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:59,485
Speaker 6:  little things they've done. So I think for starters, loads of components

180
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,925
Speaker 6:  can be removed with just a Phillips head screw and then they've got little

181
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,725
Speaker 6:  ly icons kind printed into the shay to kind of go, okay, If, you wanted to

182
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,325
Speaker 6:  remove the battery, you want remove these three screws

183
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:12,605
Speaker 6:  and then they've got little QR codes in there that you can scan and it takes

184
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:15,685
Speaker 6:  you to a page on Lenovo's website where it shows you a what part you need

185
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:18,565
Speaker 6:  and BA little like video showing you how to, how to replace this thing. And

186
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:22,005
Speaker 6:  like that's, it's like the transparent laptop kind of gets you in

187
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:25,205
Speaker 6:  Lenovo's door and then when they're there they're like, okay, but this is

188
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:29,565
Speaker 6:  the less lesson attention grabby Sure thing that's actually

189
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:33,325
Speaker 6:  gonna have like a, a huge impact on like the thousands and

190
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,405
Speaker 6:  thousands of businesses that buy those ThinkPad laptops.

191
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:39,645
Speaker 2:  No, I, I remember years ago somebody, I think it was at Lenovo told

192
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:43,405
Speaker 2:  me that they make really cool colored laptops to

193
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:47,285
Speaker 2:  bring you over to the shelf so that you'll buy their black laptop. And I,

194
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:50,485
Speaker 2:  I have thought about that ever since that they're like, everybody loves this

195
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:54,325
Speaker 2:  like rad orange thing that we made and absolutely nobody buys it

196
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:58,525
Speaker 2:  but it is literally marketing for our other colors and it's just like, you

197
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:01,405
Speaker 2:  know what? If that's what we do with this new stuff, I can live with that

198
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,885
Speaker 2:  for a while. Yeah, Allison speaking of truly insane things that will probably

199
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:08,645
Speaker 2:  never come to a real product but I love to pieces. Anyway, you saw a thing

200
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:10,685
Speaker 2:  that I believe you have named Bendy the bendy phone.

201
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,325
Speaker 7:  Yeah, bendy phone.

202
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:13,405
Speaker 2:  Tell us about this.

203
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,965
Speaker 7:  It's a phone that bends. No, this was a, a similar

204
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:20,885
Speaker 7:  thing. Motorola, you know, owned by Lenovo. Oh

205
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:23,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we're just doing a whole Lenovo thing here. I didn't even mean to do

206
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:23,645
Speaker 2:  that. Yeah,

207
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:26,805
Speaker 7:  Okay. Yeah that's, that's always saw the show was Motorola

208
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,005
Speaker 2:  Phones

209
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:31,165
Speaker 7:  Apparently. No they have this con it's a concept phone so similar,

210
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,365
Speaker 7:  they're just kind of like, we're trying this out, it's just to see if we

211
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:38,325
Speaker 7:  can do it. They showed it off I think late last year or earlier this

212
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:41,805
Speaker 7:  year. But it's a actual phone. Like they showed me it

213
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:45,765
Speaker 7:  runs apps and all that stuff, but it just

214
00:13:45,895 --> 00:13:49,605
Speaker 7:  bends backwards. You sort of get to that point of like, okay,

215
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:53,445
Speaker 7:  so why and the, the couple things they had worked out

216
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:57,445
Speaker 7:  was like there was a little metal bracelet you could put on and then it would,

217
00:13:57,445 --> 00:14:01,245
Speaker 7:  the case that the, that bendy phone was in would just kind of

218
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:04,285
Speaker 7:  clamp onto it and then you have this like massive chunky

219
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:08,365
Speaker 7:  bracelet or watch on your arm and it's like, okay,

220
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:10,045
Speaker 2:  Probably not though. Yeah

221
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:13,645
Speaker 7:  I don't think I'm gonna wear that but like, okay that's a thing you can do.

222
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:17,685
Speaker 7:  And then, and it and it sort of like, it doesn't just kind of bendy one

223
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:21,645
Speaker 7:  way you can sort of like curve the top part of the screen a

224
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:25,405
Speaker 7:  little more and they had it so it would kind of run

225
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:29,725
Speaker 7:  a little launcher on like half of the screen just pretty much

226
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:33,645
Speaker 7:  the way the flip razor phones like cover screen

227
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:37,525
Speaker 7:  works so you get like little widgets and you can run

228
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:41,205
Speaker 7:  a full app If you want but it's weird. Yeah it would just, just kind of a

229
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:44,925
Speaker 7:  fun like you see it and you're like, oh I don't, I don't know what is this.

230
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:49,005
Speaker 7:  But then I've come around to like, it's a gadget. Like this is fun.

231
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:50,765
Speaker 7:  Why? Why shouldn't we have fun?

232
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:54,365
Speaker 2:  I totally agree. And then I think all the way on the other end of the like

233
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:57,605
Speaker 2:  is this a thing spectrum? You also saw the Galaxy ring which you mentioned,

234
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,325
Speaker 2:  which I'm totally fascinated by. I am desperate to become a smart ring

235
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:04,925
Speaker 2:  person but yeah the only one I have is the aura and it's just like a little

236
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:09,045
Speaker 2:  big and I notice it too much on my hand and I don't love it but I'm

237
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:12,565
Speaker 2:  very excited about the Galaxy ring and you got to try it, which we had not

238
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:14,245
Speaker 2:  before. How did it go? What'd you make of it?

239
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:18,605
Speaker 7:  So as a disclaimer, I do not have an aura ring. I'm not super

240
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:22,605
Speaker 7:  familiar with the category, but I was allowed to put the Galaxy ring on.

241
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:26,645
Speaker 7:  It's surprisingly light, like the pictures of it, it looks kind of

242
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:30,365
Speaker 7:  dense and you think, you know, there's like a battery and a bunch of

243
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:34,325
Speaker 7:  sensors in there. It might be kind of heavy but it, it wasn't, it

244
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:38,085
Speaker 7:  has kind of like this concave shape on the outside

245
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:42,005
Speaker 7:  so it sort of like takes up less space on your finger

246
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:46,005
Speaker 7:  than you think it's going to. And just the, the overall concept is

247
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:49,885
Speaker 7:  like, you know, not everybody wants a smartwatch or

248
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:53,725
Speaker 7:  can really wear awar smartwatch. Maybe you don't want like

249
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:57,885
Speaker 7:  notifications buzzing on your arm all day but you want some kind of fitness

250
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:01,805
Speaker 7:  tracking or wellness tracking kind of deal And that's where

251
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:05,645
Speaker 7:  this will come in and I think that's a pretty compelling pitch.

252
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:07,765
Speaker 2:  I agree. John, are you a smart ring guy?

253
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:11,725
Speaker 6:  I'm not a smart ring guy. I okay. So I wasn't able to actually hold the ring

254
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:15,565
Speaker 6:  but I did peer it through a perspec box at Samsung's booth and that thing

255
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:19,365
Speaker 6:  looks so slim and spelt so I'm really tempted by it.

256
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:23,485
Speaker 6:  But I'm also kind of really in the Garmin like

257
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:27,365
Speaker 6:  health tracking ecosystem. And so the thing I

258
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:30,525
Speaker 6:  want out of Smart Rings at the moment is basically for them to kind of be

259
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:34,205
Speaker 6:  a little bit more commoditized and kind of work across different ecosystems.

260
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,605
Speaker 6:  I believe there's, there's one quote that kind of suggested that maybe the

261
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:40,205
Speaker 6:  Galaxy ring would work exclusively with with Android phones to start and

262
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:43,525
Speaker 6:  that they're kind of hoping to to support iPhones down the line.

263
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:47,925
Speaker 6:  And that feels like that could be the tricky thing to get

264
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,525
Speaker 6:  over in initially. That if this thing is gonna be a hey you're like you're

265
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:54,165
Speaker 6:  in Samsung's ecosystem or you're in the Android ecosystem, it works with

266
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:57,485
Speaker 6:  all that stuff but there's a, there's a wall between that and then kind of

267
00:16:57,485 --> 00:17:00,685
Speaker 6:  like the broader wearables market. Yeah.

268
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:03,805
Speaker 2:  That that is very fair. Speaking of wearables actually I think there were

269
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:07,605
Speaker 2:  two kind of big name watches that dropped at the show, right? Was it the

270
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:11,725
Speaker 2:  Xiaomi one and the OnePlus watch? Were there any other big watches that people

271
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:13,285
Speaker 2:  were talking about? I I just saw those two.

272
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:17,765
Speaker 7:  I think that was it. The Xiaomi is super cool 'cause you can take

273
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:21,725
Speaker 7:  the bezel off and like they have different ones you can interchange it

274
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:21,885
Speaker 7:  with

275
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:25,485
Speaker 2:  Like instead of just changing your your strap out to make it look different,

276
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:28,565
Speaker 2:  you can actually change the bezel. Like that's cool, I'm into that. Yeah,

277
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:32,765
Speaker 6:  Like hypothetically maybe you got a Garmin watch as a gift and it's in this

278
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:36,045
Speaker 6:  kind of fetching turquoise color and then you can change the strap but you

279
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:39,085
Speaker 6:  can't change the bezel around the screen so it'll never quite look right.

280
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:43,045
Speaker 6:  So you're just kind of stuck with turquoise hypothetically if you're in

281
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:46,965
Speaker 6:  that situation. Yeah, the Xiaomi watch S3 could be

282
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,885
Speaker 6:  exactly exactly what you need. So Xiaomi actually had two watches. They had

283
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:53,165
Speaker 6:  the the watch S3 which is their kind of like lower end watch and then they

284
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:56,845
Speaker 6:  had the Xmi watch two, which is their kind of slightly

285
00:17:56,865 --> 00:18:00,845
Speaker 6:  higher end wear os watch. We didn't really get like get too much of a chance

286
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:03,205
Speaker 6:  to to play around with those. But certainly from like an industrial design

287
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:06,925
Speaker 6:  perspective they look, they look pretty cool like a lot of Xiaomi stuff really

288
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:11,005
Speaker 6:  the, I think Allison got a chance to try out the, the Xmi 14 and

289
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:13,845
Speaker 6:  just, there's a very nice looking phone.

290
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:14,645
Speaker 7:  It is,

291
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Tell me about it. Allison

292
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:19,765
Speaker 7:  Yeah into the straight edge phones these days and the

293
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,725
Speaker 7:  Xiaomi 14 has embraced, you know they're on the right side of history with

294
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:27,525
Speaker 7:  the no curves, the straight edges. No it's just very

295
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:31,365
Speaker 7:  nice. And we got to see the 14 Ultra,

296
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:35,045
Speaker 7:  that's the one with the like one inch camera sensor

297
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:39,245
Speaker 7:  and all the stuff and the vegan leather back, which I also

298
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:39,485
Speaker 7:  like.

299
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:43,525
Speaker 2:  That's the one that has the round camera bump, right? Yes. I love a round

300
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:44,205
Speaker 2:  camera bump.

301
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:47,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah, it's like we're not trying to hide this thing. It is right here.

302
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:51,325
Speaker 7:  This is, this is a camera with a phone attached basically.

303
00:18:51,985 --> 00:18:55,885
Speaker 7:  So I've used the, the jam 14 a little bit but 14

304
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,885
Speaker 7:  Ultra wasn't quite available yet to us and I really wanna

305
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:00,805
Speaker 7:  get my hands on that one.

306
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,845
Speaker 2:  It looks, it looks awesome. You have a, you have a pull quote in the story

307
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:06,885
Speaker 2:  you wrote about it that just says I witnessed the aperture moving.

308
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:11,565
Speaker 2:  Which is such a like ominous thing to say but it's also like it, it means

309
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:12,725
Speaker 2:  it's a camera. That's so

310
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,845
Speaker 7:  Exciting. Yeah. Yeah that's their thing this year is that it has a variable

311
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:20,845
Speaker 7:  aperture that actually like every smartphone camera basically has a

312
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:24,525
Speaker 7:  fixed aperture. This one the aperture can get bigger and

313
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:28,365
Speaker 7:  smaller just like a dedicated camera lens. Is that a good

314
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:31,805
Speaker 7:  idea? I don't know like I don't think it's actually that

315
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:35,685
Speaker 7:  practical, I kind of put it in the category of like Sony

316
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:39,725
Speaker 7:  Xperia phones that had like a actual continuous

317
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:43,725
Speaker 7:  zoom between two focal lengths and it was like very

318
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,525
Speaker 7:  small and you're like, I don't know quite what the point of this is

319
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:49,725
Speaker 7:  but you did it. It works.

320
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,845
Speaker 2:  You did do it. You can't argue with that. I

321
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:53,085
Speaker 7:  Did

322
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:57,325
Speaker 2:  John, you get to see nothing's new phone right? At what seemed like

323
00:19:57,665 --> 00:20:01,645
Speaker 2:  one of the more bizarre showings of any kind of gadget

324
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:03,725
Speaker 2:  that we had at MWC this year. Yeah.

325
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:07,685
Speaker 6:  This phone is ostensibly being launched on March the fifth,

326
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:11,525
Speaker 6:  but nothing is at the point in its hype cycle where it is just posting full

327
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:14,845
Speaker 6:  on unboxings on its YouTube channel. Right.

328
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:19,285
Speaker 6:  And we kind of, we know the processor to media tech identity 7,200

329
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:23,405
Speaker 6:  pro I think. And then we kind of went along to this event in the

330
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:27,165
Speaker 6:  evening. So of course nothing like the MWC show floor is so

331
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:30,685
Speaker 6:  stuffy. It's just that's for like Deutsche Telecom and

332
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:34,645
Speaker 6:  Qualcomm, you know, nothing doesn't play by their rules. So nothing instead

333
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:38,685
Speaker 6:  has has this kind of like evening event where we show up and like

334
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:40,685
Speaker 6:  everyone, everyone's kinda like milling around and there were just these

335
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:44,245
Speaker 6:  like 2001 style monoliths just kind of like

336
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:48,165
Speaker 6:  dotted around and I just like catch Allison's eye and and I'm like, I'm betting

337
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:52,005
Speaker 6:  you, there's a phone two A behind inside that monolith. So we

338
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:54,685
Speaker 6:  just kind of spend the rest of the evening just like standing by one of these

339
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:57,405
Speaker 6:  things and of course then nothing stand up on stage and they go, oh you know,

340
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:00,365
Speaker 6:  thank thanks much for coming everyone this is our, this is gonna be our third

341
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:03,245
Speaker 6:  smartphone. We we're so, we're so excited to reveal it to the world and and

342
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:07,045
Speaker 6:  then suddenly like all of these monoliths that the, the sheath gets

343
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:10,085
Speaker 6:  taken off and it's, oh look, it's a Perspex box where a nothing phone two

344
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,925
Speaker 6:  A in it and oh there it's the flashing gif. Oh so we

345
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:17,805
Speaker 6:  got, we, okay. I don't know like how much inside baseball you want here

346
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:18,685
Speaker 6:  David. Very

347
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:19,165
Speaker 2:  Keep going.

348
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:23,205
Speaker 6:  Okay cool. So Alice and I game planned this. We were like, we're gonna

349
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:26,365
Speaker 6:  stand by where we think The Phone is gonna be revealed. I will have my camera,

350
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:30,725
Speaker 6:  you will have your iPhone 15. I will snap the photo as quickly

351
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:34,725
Speaker 6:  as I can and I will hand you the SD card. You will quickly put the

352
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:38,845
Speaker 6:  SD card into your like USB C adapter, put that on The Phone, get

353
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:42,005
Speaker 6:  that uploaded on The Verge and then like rather than like tweeting it or

354
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:45,485
Speaker 6:  putting it on on threads or whatever, we'll like have the images on The Verge

355
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:49,405
Speaker 6:  super quickly. And then of course just way over-engineered

356
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:50,645
Speaker 6:  this entire situation.

357
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:53,045
Speaker 7:  It all fell apart. It's

358
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,805
Speaker 6:  So quickly and the iPhone sucked up the

359
00:21:56,905 --> 00:22:00,005
Speaker 6:  raw file. Well first off, like Alison opens up my SD card and is like, why

360
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:03,365
Speaker 6:  do you have so many pictures of keyboards in here John? And you have to scroll

361
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:03,605
Speaker 6:  through

362
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:06,725
Speaker 7:  It was 1000 pictures of keyboards. Yeah.

363
00:22:07,105 --> 00:22:09,965
Speaker 6:  And then right at the bottom we had the nothing phone two A shots and then

364
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:13,765
Speaker 6:  she kind of copies them over, then we upload them into our, our CMS

365
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,005
Speaker 6:  chorus.

366
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:18,085
Speaker 7:  I had to log back into chorus, it logged me out of course.

367
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:21,645
Speaker 6:  And then chorus is like, we can't, we can't take a raw file. We're sorry.

368
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,925
Speaker 6:  And so just the whole, it was not nearly as quick or seamless. Yeah

369
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:30,205
Speaker 7:  This was in the category of you know, luxurious trip

370
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:34,205
Speaker 7:  to overseas countries where I'm like literally standing under a plant.

371
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:38,125
Speaker 7:  Like there was a big plant like right. And I had my laptop out at this

372
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:42,085
Speaker 7:  fancy restaurant and I'm like opening, I mean camera raw like trying

373
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:45,925
Speaker 7:  to retouch some photos and upload them with chorus and I'm like,

374
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:49,365
Speaker 7:  this is, I just don't know how to explain this to any normal person.

375
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:52,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Waiters and waitresses kept on coming by and like leaning 'cause we

376
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,685
Speaker 6:  were on the kind of make D table and they were trying to get like

377
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:59,525
Speaker 6:  cutlery out of this. And then of course friend of The Verge Sam Byford just

378
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,965
Speaker 6:  like shows us his phone is just like, should've just taken on your smartphone.

379
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,285
Speaker 6:  Smartphone cameras are real good.

380
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:07,605
Speaker 7:  He was just watching us like not saying I told you so, but it was like

381
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:08,485
Speaker 7:  all over his face.

382
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:11,085
Speaker 2:  If you're listening to this and you're wondering If, you should get into

383
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:13,525
Speaker 2:  tech journalism. The answer's yes, but also that is what all of your days

384
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,365
Speaker 2:  will look like. It just is what it is.

385
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:18,125
Speaker 8:  Alright,

386
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,645
Speaker 2:  We're gonna take a quick break and then more MWC talk. We'll be right back.

387
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:14,145
Speaker 2:  Alright, we're back with Allison and John. So the, the last thing I had on

388
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:18,025
Speaker 2:  my like cool things you guys saw list is also kind of the

389
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,625
Speaker 2:  big picture thing that I feel like was happening at MWC, which is basically

390
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:26,025
Speaker 2:  what is a phone if it's not just a collection of apps that Google

391
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:29,745
Speaker 2:  or Apple runs. And John you wrote about this going in as kind of

392
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:33,345
Speaker 2:  what you were thinking about entering into the show and I think it really

393
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:37,065
Speaker 2:  proved out right that the idea is what is sort of the post

394
00:26:37,205 --> 00:26:40,825
Speaker 2:  app smartphone look like and Allison you got a demo I think of

395
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:44,925
Speaker 2:  an a phone or an app or I don't even know what to call it, from a company

396
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:48,885
Speaker 2:  called Brain AI that is doing something along these lines, right?

397
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:52,525
Speaker 2:  I still, I have trouble explaining what this thing is to people, but you've

398
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,285
Speaker 2:  now seen it. Can you explain what this thing is?

399
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:58,325
Speaker 7:  Yeah, so they're kind of billing it as an

400
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:02,325
Speaker 7:  aless phone and the spoiler alert is that it The Phone

401
00:27:02,345 --> 00:27:06,125
Speaker 7:  has apps, it's like a regular phone, but this company Brain AI is

402
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,685
Speaker 7:  launching it. We're planning to launch it with Deutsche Telecom, AKA

403
00:27:09,805 --> 00:27:13,565
Speaker 7:  T-Mobile. And it's, right now what it is is this sort of

404
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:17,485
Speaker 7:  like you have the normal OS and then there's this like almost like digital

405
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:21,565
Speaker 7:  assistant where you can launch a page and it's, it

406
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:25,525
Speaker 7:  looks a little bit like a chat GPT kind of text box where you're like, tell

407
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:29,325
Speaker 7:  me about this. But the idea is you, you ask for things, you wanna

408
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:33,125
Speaker 7:  book a flight, you wanna look for a gift or something, you

409
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:37,005
Speaker 7:  kind of type it in and it starts building this interface around whatever

410
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:40,845
Speaker 7:  you're asking for. So you're not going directly into like

411
00:27:41,045 --> 00:27:44,965
Speaker 7:  a travel booking app, you just sort of like ask it to

412
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:48,045
Speaker 7:  become a travel booking app and it builds it around you.

413
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:52,205
Speaker 2:  But instead of just doing text for everything, it'll actually try and like

414
00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:55,485
Speaker 2:  redo the interface for whatever you're trying to do. Yeah,

415
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:59,045
Speaker 7:  They say they've trained this AI on

416
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:02,925
Speaker 7:  interfaces. It's not like a large language model.

417
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:06,805
Speaker 7:  It's sort of like here's how you present information so

418
00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:10,605
Speaker 7:  someone can do something with it. And then I think the really cool part

419
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:14,325
Speaker 7:  is like you ask for something like the demo they gave me was like, show me

420
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:18,205
Speaker 7:  a ideas for a gift for my girlfriend who likes tennis. And you

421
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:21,645
Speaker 7:  get, you know, kind of a page of results and you're scrolling through and

422
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:25,045
Speaker 7:  you can stop at something and kind of tap on it and ask for,

423
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:28,805
Speaker 7:  you know, a question. You can ask a question about it, you can say, show

424
00:28:28,805 --> 00:28:32,645
Speaker 7:  me a video of this thing. And it did like, it answered the question

425
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:36,525
Speaker 7:  correctly about how fast it could shoot the tennis balls. It was a

426
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:40,165
Speaker 7:  tennis ball machine or like a little YouTube video module

427
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:43,765
Speaker 7:  kind of pop up under it. So it all just kind of

428
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:47,805
Speaker 7:  happens in the sa like kind of fluidly in the same

429
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:52,045
Speaker 7:  space. You're not going, I wanna watch a video of this, I'm gonna jump

430
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:55,725
Speaker 7:  over to a different app, I'm gonna type in some text. Which is a really

431
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:59,565
Speaker 7:  compelling way to think of like, yeah, maybe our

432
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:03,285
Speaker 7:  phones don't have to be these, you know, boxes with

433
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:07,045
Speaker 7:  drawers in them where you're constantly, you know, drilling down to the thing

434
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,565
Speaker 7:  you want. There's so much that's unproven about this right now.

435
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,845
Speaker 7:  It's very focused on like shopping, which is, I think

436
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:19,125
Speaker 7:  AI companies love the idea that we just always wanna book flights, you

437
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:23,085
Speaker 7:  know, from San Francisco to Maui or whatever. I'm sorry, like I want

438
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:26,845
Speaker 7:  help with my email. Like what about productivity and all those things. And

439
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:30,885
Speaker 7:  Jerry, you the, the founder of the company is like, that is coming, that's

440
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:34,765
Speaker 7:  kind of the next step. But yeah, and they, they don't have a launch date.

441
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:38,845
Speaker 7:  They are targeting Europe and the US but they couldn't give

442
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:42,605
Speaker 7:  like a, a definitive timeframe. But I'm super interested in it.

443
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:46,645
Speaker 2:  It's a neat idea. Yeah. John, what did you see, I know you came in kind of

444
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:50,245
Speaker 2:  looking at this question of like, what's next after app stores.

445
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,405
Speaker 2:  Do you see anything that piqued your interest?

446
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:56,565
Speaker 6:  I will say no. I think I saw, I saw a much more

447
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:59,885
Speaker 6:  traditional show than I think I was,

448
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:04,525
Speaker 6:  I was expecting, but also I think my kind of, my takeaway for a lot

449
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:08,485
Speaker 6:  of the stuff we saw was for me, I I kind of, I ended up kind of comparing

450
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:12,245
Speaker 6:  and contrasting the Humane ai Pin with the rabbit R one

451
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:16,405
Speaker 6:  from CES, the, the rabbit R one, like wasn't wasn't present NWC, but I think

452
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:19,845
Speaker 6:  that so much of introducing a new product

453
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:24,205
Speaker 6:  category is talking about a potential rather than what exactly it can

454
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:27,605
Speaker 6:  do. And I think when talking about potential, it's very easy to kind of get

455
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:30,925
Speaker 6:  very philosophical and very naval gey in a way that kind of puts people off,

456
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:35,045
Speaker 6:  which I think is the direction that Humane has kind of gone in. And then

457
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:38,565
Speaker 6:  if everyone's kinda actually seen the Pin kind of goes, oh this is, this

458
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:42,205
Speaker 6:  is a gadget, this is a gadget, gadgety gadget that like does a bunch of gadget

459
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:45,405
Speaker 6:  stuff and that's, and that's cool, but it's kind of been wrapped up in this,

460
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:49,245
Speaker 6:  in this very philosophical idea of, oh we, we wanna get rid of smartphone

461
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:52,165
Speaker 6:  and screens are bad and stuff. And it's so interesting kind of comparing

462
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:55,885
Speaker 6:  the, the reception of the Humane eye open to the, to the rabbit

463
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:59,845
Speaker 6:  R one, which from what I could see was very warmly

464
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,765
Speaker 6:  received despite having a, a similarly kind of

465
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:07,765
Speaker 6:  experimental approach towards what a

466
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:12,165
Speaker 6:  non phone gadget can be. And the difference seemed to be in, in that, in

467
00:31:12,165 --> 00:31:15,165
Speaker 6:  that kind of like pitch. I mean also I think that the rabbit r ones kind

468
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:18,565
Speaker 6:  of teenage engineering industrial design kind of helped and you kinda have

469
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:21,885
Speaker 6:  to look at the Humane eye opinion and go, well you just won teenage engineering

470
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:26,245
Speaker 6:  deal away from like a much more positive. But

471
00:31:26,245 --> 00:31:29,925
Speaker 6:  yeah, so this, that was like a lot of my takeaway is that it's

472
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:34,165
Speaker 6:  the, the story that you want to tell about the next step.

473
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:38,205
Speaker 6:  I think If, you kind of shoot high, you lose people and If you shoot low,

474
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:42,005
Speaker 6:  then you end up with a kind of, this is today's smartphone, but but slightly

475
00:31:42,005 --> 00:31:45,805
Speaker 6:  faster. And so there's that kind of like the, I think the, the

476
00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:49,365
Speaker 6:  Atla phone thing kind of sits in the middle there quite nicely where you

477
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:53,005
Speaker 6:  go, you already have this thing, you already know the form factor of it,

478
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:56,845
Speaker 6:  but what if, what if there were less apps that you downloaded and, and what

479
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:59,325
Speaker 6:  if it was more kind of customized to towards your needs?

480
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:03,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Allison, you got to use the Pin, well use, use might be a slightly

481
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,925
Speaker 2:  strong word for what happened with you and the Pin, but what was your experience?

482
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:07,565
Speaker 2:  What'd you make of it?

483
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:12,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I I hovered near a couple of people as they used the Pin

484
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:12,765
Speaker 7:  and I just, yeah,

485
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:16,285
Speaker 2:  I think the way you said it was somebody used the Pin at you. Yeah. And that's

486
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:17,245
Speaker 2:  that's good enough. Yeah,

487
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:21,405
Speaker 7:  I, I did try to like, I was like, can I just like stand real close to

488
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:24,605
Speaker 7:  you and like have it project onto my hand and we like tried that for a second.

489
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:27,245
Speaker 7:  It was very awkward and didn't really work. You had to

490
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,485
Speaker 2:  Like hug them from behind. Yeah, yeah. And reach your arms around it's like,

491
00:32:30,485 --> 00:32:30,605
Speaker 2:  can

492
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:34,165
Speaker 7:  I just like put my head on your shoulder? It was like very sweet of them

493
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:37,965
Speaker 7:  to let me try that. That's nice. Yeah, exactly like John said,

494
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:41,845
Speaker 7:  it's, it's a, a gadget, like you hear all the marketing and the

495
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:45,525
Speaker 7:  TED talks and all this stuff and there's just like no

496
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:49,605
Speaker 7:  piece of technology could ever live up to like what I am hearing about

497
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:53,325
Speaker 7:  and you see it in person and you're like, this is just kind of cool. Like

498
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:57,685
Speaker 7:  I think it would make a lot more sense if it was something that

499
00:32:57,685 --> 00:33:01,245
Speaker 7:  was designed to compliment your phone and, and the

500
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:05,405
Speaker 7:  spokespeople I talked to were very like, no, no, this isn't supposed

501
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:09,365
Speaker 7:  to replace your phone. It's like, you know, it just, when you kind of wanna

502
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:12,325
Speaker 7:  unplug from your phone, you have it, but it costs

503
00:33:12,735 --> 00:33:16,645
Speaker 7:  $700. It has a subscription fee, it has its

504
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:20,445
Speaker 7:  own sim card. Like, I don't know a lot of people who are gonna have

505
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:24,085
Speaker 7:  a phone and a budget for like a basically another phone.

506
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:28,525
Speaker 7:  So it's, I still have weird feelings about it. I still have questions, but

507
00:33:28,595 --> 00:33:32,365
Speaker 7:  what I saw was, was kind of cool like the, the navigation,

508
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:36,925
Speaker 7:  you know, that you do kind of a, a pinchy pinch thing to

509
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:41,045
Speaker 7:  scroll through the menus that the laser's projecting onto your hand.

510
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:44,965
Speaker 7:  I saw one of these spokespeople, she had to like check the wifi

511
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:49,085
Speaker 7:  settings on it, which is just sounds like a nightmare thing to,

512
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:53,325
Speaker 7:  to do and it kind of made sense. She was like, okay

513
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:57,285
Speaker 7:  doing the little like maneuvers and I don't know, it's gonna be

514
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,205
Speaker 7:  a wild one. I think

515
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:02,445
Speaker 2:  I really love the idea of projecting a settings menu like

516
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:06,685
Speaker 2:  huge onto the wall next to me while I slowly scroll through all the

517
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:08,485
Speaker 2:  wifi options. This works for me. I'm into this,

518
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:10,205
Speaker 7:  It's the feature. All

519
00:34:10,205 --> 00:34:13,805
Speaker 2:  Right, let's do, we're gonna do a really quick MWC awards lightning round

520
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:16,245
Speaker 2:  and then I'm gonna let you guys get outta here because you, you both need

521
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:20,205
Speaker 2:  to sleep after MWC the silliest thing that you saw at MWC that you kind of

522
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:21,725
Speaker 2:  love anyway. John, go first.

523
00:34:23,265 --> 00:34:26,805
Speaker 6:  The idea of HMD make a big song or dance about a Barbie flip phone that's

524
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:26,965
Speaker 6:  coming.

525
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:30,165
Speaker 7:  That's a good one.

526
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,565
Speaker 2:  Fair. Very good answer. Allison, what do you got?

527
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:36,765
Speaker 7:  I think I gotta go with Bendy phone. I played Connect four on it. They

528
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:39,605
Speaker 7:  had it like set up. That's like one of the things you can do with it. I'm

529
00:34:39,605 --> 00:34:40,805
Speaker 7:  like, oh I love this.

530
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:43,245
Speaker 6:  Actually I'm so sorry. Can I change my answer?

531
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:43,765
Speaker 2:  Sure.

532
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:47,125
Speaker 6:  28,000 million power battery phones.

533
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:48,045
Speaker 6:  Oh

534
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:52,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think your headline for that was this Gigantic Battery has a phone

535
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:52,845
Speaker 2:  attached to it.

536
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:57,125
Speaker 6:  I a hundred percent stole a former colleague Vlad sas. Oh yeah. Like

537
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,165
Speaker 6:  four, four or five years ago they had an 18,000 million power phone. Now

538
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,725
Speaker 6:  they're back 28,000 million power. That's called Progress baby. Yeah. Get

539
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:08,605
Speaker 2:  Out here with 18,000, come on in. That's what inflation does. I

540
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:08,725
Speaker 2:  love

541
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:08,925
Speaker 6:  This.

542
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:13,925
Speaker 2:  Alright thing you think a lot of people are most likely to buy very soon

543
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:17,445
Speaker 2:  that you just saw what screams like big hit

544
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,365
Speaker 2:  coming soon?

545
00:35:18,675 --> 00:35:22,565
Speaker 6:  Well, I mean, I dunno about big hit, but Lenovo's repairable laptops,

546
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:26,085
Speaker 6:  that's, that's just gonna be businesses all over the world are gonna have

547
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:28,365
Speaker 6:  those things and people are barely gonna think about it, but there's gonna

548
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:31,885
Speaker 6:  be some it admin with his little Philip Head screwdriver

549
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:36,085
Speaker 6:  just going like, ah, yes, this laptop will live live another day. Thank you

550
00:35:36,085 --> 00:35:36,485
Speaker 6:  very much.

551
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:38,565
Speaker 2:  Love it. Allison, what about you?

552
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:42,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I don't know if big hit but like Galaxy ring I think has

553
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:46,165
Speaker 7:  a lot of potential I would say, especially for something that,

554
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:50,485
Speaker 7:  I mean it's not brand new but it's sort of a new category for Samsung

555
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:53,725
Speaker 7:  and it, so it's kind of rare to be like, oh yeah, I can, I can see where

556
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:57,205
Speaker 7:  you guys are going with this and I, I am, I'm curious to see

557
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:58,565
Speaker 7:  what happens. Okay,

558
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:02,725
Speaker 2:  I love it. Yeah, I am super bullish on Smart Rings as a thing. I think there's

559
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:05,125
Speaker 2:  like a lot of stuff left to do, but I think that category is gonna be really

560
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:09,285
Speaker 2:  interesting for a while. All right, last one thing you held in your

561
00:36:09,285 --> 00:36:12,525
Speaker 2:  hands in a most wished you could have just taken home with you in that moment

562
00:36:12,675 --> 00:36:15,965
Speaker 2:  that you're like, this is mine now I'm going to leave, I'm going to pickpocket

563
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,965
Speaker 2:  someone in Barcelona and this belongs to me now. John, what do you got?

564
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:22,805
Speaker 6:  Okay, it's like, so this company Infinix, this wasn't like brand new for

565
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:26,805
Speaker 6:  MWC, but they had a concept concept phone called the e color shift where

566
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:30,685
Speaker 6:  basically whenever it charges, it has an e Ink display on its rear

567
00:36:30,995 --> 00:36:34,925
Speaker 6:  that rapidly changes between different color schemes. And then the idea is

568
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:38,885
Speaker 6:  you like yank out the power cord when it kind of hits the, hits the the

569
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:41,285
Speaker 6:  color that you like and you're like, cool, this is, this is the color of

570
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:44,925
Speaker 6:  my phone now. This is great. That's so fun. It's so, it's so great and like

571
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:48,245
Speaker 6:  it's not even a functional phone and it is, it's a concept thing. They think

572
00:36:48,335 --> 00:36:50,765
Speaker 6:  maybe in the next couple of years they'll, they'll actually bring this thing

573
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:54,645
Speaker 6:  out but yeah, you're just like a checkout. You can't decide between

574
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:58,245
Speaker 6:  the like really adventurous color and and black W like why not both?

575
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:00,325
Speaker 2:  I love that Allison, what about you?

576
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:04,285
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna go with the Xiaomi 14 ultra with the like

577
00:37:04,905 --> 00:37:08,685
Speaker 7:  sub category of the photography kit. They

578
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:12,445
Speaker 7:  introduced this with last year's series and it's like a little

579
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:16,485
Speaker 7:  camera grip you put on The Phone. It sounds so stupid but I loved

580
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,245
Speaker 7:  it. It has a little shutter button. They're doing it again this year for

581
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:22,685
Speaker 7:  the 14 Ultra, but it's like actually more useful and it has a battery in

582
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:26,285
Speaker 7:  it. I love what they do with their cameras and it's just like

583
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:29,365
Speaker 7:  a camera nerds phone. I want one.

584
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:32,605
Speaker 2:  That's a good one. I like it. Alright, you both need to go get some sleep

585
00:37:32,865 --> 00:37:36,285
Speaker 2:  and recover from all of your many travels. Thank you both for doing this.

586
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:38,325
Speaker 2:  This was, this was super fun. Can't wait to do it again.

587
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:39,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah, thank you. My

588
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:40,645
Speaker 6:  Pleasure. Thank you having me.

589
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:44,085
Speaker 2:  Okay, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and answer

590
00:37:44,085 --> 00:37:45,605
Speaker 2:  our question from the first cast Hotline

591
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:50,985
Speaker 11:  Sweat.

592
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:28,065
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the Hotline as always. The number is

593
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:31,865
Speaker 2:  8 6 6 Verge one one. The email is Vergecast at The Verge

594
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:34,945
Speaker 2:  dot com. We love all your questions, we try to answer at least one on the

595
00:39:34,945 --> 00:39:37,825
Speaker 2:  show every week. Thank you as always. To everybody who calls and emails,

596
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:40,585
Speaker 2:  we love hearing from you. This week we have a question from Taylor.

597
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:45,785
Speaker 14:  Hi, this is Taylor from Colorado, love the show. And I was curious

598
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:49,585
Speaker 14:  this week with you talking so much about Crawler Bot and the consequences

599
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:53,905
Speaker 14:  of ai, what do you think the impact is gonna be on websites

600
00:39:53,905 --> 00:39:57,185
Speaker 14:  like the way back machine that are archiving the internet and in some ways

601
00:39:57,185 --> 00:40:01,145
Speaker 14:  have already been accessing New York Times and other

602
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:04,745
Speaker 14:  places behind paywall, but also are really important to

603
00:40:05,295 --> 00:40:09,145
Speaker 14:  Wikipedia and the history of the internet would look to

604
00:40:09,225 --> 00:40:11,065
Speaker 14:  know more what y'all think next? Bye.

605
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:15,625
Speaker 2:  I love this question because it gets at something that actually I

606
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:18,585
Speaker 2:  wrote about on The Verge a couple of weeks ago. I'll put the link in the

607
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:22,305
Speaker 2:  show notes. But this idea of access and basically who

608
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:26,065
Speaker 2:  controls what is public and what is private on the web.

609
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:29,985
Speaker 2:  And just Taylor, to answer your question directly, the answer is yes, it's

610
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:33,985
Speaker 2:  a huge deal and it's potentially a huge change in how

611
00:40:34,185 --> 00:40:38,065
Speaker 2:  a lot of these things work. So there's things like the internet archive,

612
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:41,985
Speaker 2:  right? Which is going out and literally just downloading versions of

613
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:45,825
Speaker 2:  webpages periodically in order for you to be able to go find them later.

614
00:40:46,165 --> 00:40:50,145
Speaker 2:  The internet archive a bunch of years ago essentially said, we're doing

615
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:53,465
Speaker 2:  this for the good of humanity and we are going to do it no matter what you

616
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:57,185
Speaker 2:  think. So every website in theory has this thing called robots

617
00:40:57,245 --> 00:41:00,265
Speaker 2:  dot txt, which is just If. You go to whatever the website is,

618
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:04,225
Speaker 2:  amazon.com/robots.txt. It's just

619
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:08,025
Speaker 2:  a simple text file and basically what it does in most cases is

620
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:11,825
Speaker 2:  say which web crawler bots are allowed in and which

621
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:15,825
Speaker 2:  are not allowed. And for like three decades, this was actually

622
00:41:15,865 --> 00:41:18,745
Speaker 2:  a thing that was created in the nineties back when you know, having a bunch

623
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:22,025
Speaker 2:  of crawlers on your website could actually crash your website because internet

624
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:24,985
Speaker 2:  infrastructure was slow and didn't work all that well. But for the last three

625
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:28,905
Speaker 2:  decades it's mostly been about search engines. The idea was do I

626
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:33,025
Speaker 2:  as a website owner want Google to crawl my website? And it's essentially

627
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,925
Speaker 2:  a question about exchange of value, right? So you say, I want Google to crawl

628
00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:40,445
Speaker 2:  my website, that means Google is going to use some of my bandwidth costs,

629
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:44,245
Speaker 2:  it costs money to let its crawler come and look at all of my webpages and

630
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:47,965
Speaker 2:  it means Google has access to a cache of every one of my

631
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:51,645
Speaker 2:  webpage at some interval of time. In exchange I get to be

632
00:41:51,745 --> 00:41:55,085
Speaker 2:  in Google's search engine and Google will send traffic to my website. So

633
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:58,685
Speaker 2:  there are a bunch of versions of that. Bing runs a crawler that does very

634
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:02,205
Speaker 2:  similar things, but for a long time that was the exchange. The internet archive

635
00:42:02,205 --> 00:42:05,925
Speaker 2:  was a slightly different one where in a sense you're getting something back

636
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:08,525
Speaker 2:  from the internet archive, but it's not like they're sending you traffic.

637
00:42:08,665 --> 00:42:12,125
Speaker 2:  The traffic to the internet archive goes to the internet archive,

638
00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:15,765
Speaker 2:  their download of your website. In general, I think most people think the

639
00:42:15,845 --> 00:42:18,845
Speaker 2:  internet archive is like a net good for humanity. So, I think this wasn't

640
00:42:18,845 --> 00:42:22,645
Speaker 2:  really a huge issue, but If, you didn't want the internet

641
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:25,365
Speaker 2:  archive to crawl your website for whatever reason and there are plenty of

642
00:42:25,365 --> 00:42:28,965
Speaker 2:  valid reasons not to. You could in theory in that robots

643
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:33,205
Speaker 2:  txt page block the internet archive. The internet archive said I think in

644
00:42:33,205 --> 00:42:37,085
Speaker 2:  2017 that it was just no longer going to respect that, that its mission

645
00:42:37,105 --> 00:42:40,925
Speaker 2:  was too important, that it was doing things that were good and valuable and

646
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:44,325
Speaker 2:  it was no longer interested in respecting the wishes of somebody's robots

647
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:47,925
Speaker 2:  txt page. That page has huge sort of normative

648
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:52,325
Speaker 2:  value on the internet, but no actual real legal authority. It

649
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:55,925
Speaker 2:  has no technical authority. It's just kind of a way of saying, you know,

650
00:42:55,925 --> 00:42:59,285
Speaker 2:  please keep out. It's like putting a sign on your tree house. It doesn't

651
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,725
Speaker 2:  really accomplish anything, but it does send a message. But If, you don't

652
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:05,365
Speaker 2:  wanna listen, you don't really have to. So that has all been happening

653
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:09,405
Speaker 2:  over the years and there have been people who want more sophisticated tools

654
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:12,725
Speaker 2:  to actually keep people out. There have been more sophisticated

655
00:43:12,955 --> 00:43:16,605
Speaker 2:  reasons for the protocol to exist behind robots

656
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:20,245
Speaker 2:  txt, but in general it has just been around and it has more or less worked

657
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,605
Speaker 2:  and more or less been okay with people. But now like Taylor is saying with

658
00:43:23,825 --> 00:43:27,725
Speaker 2:  ai, two things are happening. One, a lot of these companies that

659
00:43:27,745 --> 00:43:30,805
Speaker 2:  run websites are starting to think a lot more carefully about what is and

660
00:43:30,805 --> 00:43:34,085
Speaker 2:  is not allowed on their website. So you can say

661
00:43:34,785 --> 00:43:37,965
Speaker 2:  not just, I wanna block Google, but I wanna block open AI because I don't

662
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:41,765
Speaker 2:  want my stuff going into open AI's training data for

663
00:43:41,765 --> 00:43:44,525
Speaker 2:  its large language models. So you could block GPT bot, that's the one that

664
00:43:44,545 --> 00:43:48,285
Speaker 2:  OpenAI does. Most of the other AI companies have crawlers of their own, they

665
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:52,125
Speaker 2:  all need this giant mass of training data. So not only are all of these

666
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:55,965
Speaker 2:  website owners having to go into that webpage and say, I

667
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:59,725
Speaker 2:  wanna block GPT bot or whatever else, it's causing them to think more

668
00:43:59,915 --> 00:44:03,405
Speaker 2:  broadly about access, right? You have an

669
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,325
Speaker 2:  antitrust case against Amazon that is fundamentally in large part

670
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:10,845
Speaker 2:  about Amazon's ability to crawl the web. It was doing this thing where it

671
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:14,805
Speaker 2:  would go around the web and look for prices on products that were

672
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:18,525
Speaker 2:  also listed on Amazon and then allegedly doing a bunch of

673
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:21,525
Speaker 2:  really shady stuff. If it found that you were listing something for cheaper

674
00:44:21,555 --> 00:44:24,725
Speaker 2:  than you were listing it on Amazon, you can't do that If, you don't have

675
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:28,085
Speaker 2:  an automated way to crawl the web, it's just too much work for a single person

676
00:44:28,185 --> 00:44:32,165
Speaker 2:  to like go click on every product page on the internet. So this is the

677
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:35,965
Speaker 2:  kind of thing that's used in tons of ways, right? And not only are these

678
00:44:36,245 --> 00:44:38,885
Speaker 2:  companies going in and saying, okay, who do I want in and who do I want out?

679
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:43,125
Speaker 2:  One particularly powerful way to keep people out is a paywall.

680
00:44:43,185 --> 00:44:45,885
Speaker 2:  And like Taylor said, one of the things we're starting to see is more and

681
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:49,685
Speaker 2:  more companies, publishers, whatever, putting their

682
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:52,925
Speaker 2:  stuff behind the paywall, like one of the reasons Facebook has always required

683
00:44:52,925 --> 00:44:56,725
Speaker 2:  you to log in is because it doesn't want Google

684
00:44:56,785 --> 00:44:59,805
Speaker 2:  and everybody else to be able to access all of the data on Facebook because

685
00:44:59,805 --> 00:45:03,685
Speaker 2:  that data is really valuable. And now we're seeing companies like Reddit

686
00:45:03,685 --> 00:45:07,365
Speaker 2:  start to realize how valuable their data is in strike deals with AI companies.

687
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:11,605
Speaker 2:  So there's just this shift in how data

688
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,085
Speaker 2:  on the internet is understood. For a long time it was kind of net public.

689
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,325
Speaker 2:  The idea was to be in their place, it was gonna be fine. And now to some

690
00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:21,965
Speaker 2:  extent the website or the app or whatever is actually less

691
00:45:22,525 --> 00:45:25,805
Speaker 2:  valuable in sort of real dollar terms. Then

692
00:45:26,305 --> 00:45:29,805
Speaker 2:  the data underneath it, like the content of Reddit posts

693
00:45:30,225 --> 00:45:34,205
Speaker 2:  is probably more valuable and more important than Reddit, which is weird

694
00:45:34,205 --> 00:45:37,885
Speaker 2:  because one can't exist without the other, but that is very much

695
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:41,445
Speaker 2:  where we are. So all of this is up in the air right now for the first time

696
00:45:41,445 --> 00:45:45,405
Speaker 2:  in a really long time and in a pretty big way I think threatens

697
00:45:45,405 --> 00:45:49,085
Speaker 2:  to kind of rewrite the web. It could put much more stuff

698
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:52,845
Speaker 2:  behind registration walls and start to silo things off even more. We've talked

699
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:56,645
Speaker 2:  a lot about the sort of open future of social with Activity pub and the Fedi

700
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:59,765
Speaker 2:  verse and Mastodon, and I think all of that is very cool. I also think there

701
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:03,285
Speaker 2:  are lots and lots of incentives for all of these platforms to build

702
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:06,965
Speaker 2:  bigger walls, not knock them down because If, you knock them down,

703
00:46:07,345 --> 00:46:11,165
Speaker 2:  you give lots of companies and crawlers and people access

704
00:46:11,345 --> 00:46:15,085
Speaker 2:  to your stuff in ways that can be adversarial and problematic for you. This

705
00:46:15,085 --> 00:46:17,885
Speaker 2:  is one of the things I have spent a lot of time thinking about and talking

706
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:21,325
Speaker 2:  about with people because it's one of these sort of norms of the internet,

707
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:24,645
Speaker 2:  right? That like if I have a webpage and you have a webpage, we should both

708
00:46:24,645 --> 00:46:28,565
Speaker 2:  just be cool. And it is amazing how far that got us, but now there's so

709
00:46:28,565 --> 00:46:31,845
Speaker 2:  much money and so much change and so many new

710
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:35,845
Speaker 2:  reasons both to crawl someone else's website and to be worried about someone

711
00:46:35,845 --> 00:46:39,125
Speaker 2:  crawling your website that I think a lot of this is about to change and what

712
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:42,645
Speaker 2:  I've heard from publishers and stuff is that they didn't touch their robots

713
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:46,525
Speaker 2:  txt page for years and now it's becoming like a

714
00:46:46,795 --> 00:46:50,765
Speaker 2:  C-suite level meeting. You have to have about who do we want in, who do we

715
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:54,725
Speaker 2:  wanna block and who do we want to go try to make some kind of commercial

716
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:58,645
Speaker 2:  agreement with So I. Don't wanna overstate it, but I'm

717
00:46:58,645 --> 00:47:02,285
Speaker 2:  gonna kind of overstate it. Like I think this is possibly going to be part

718
00:47:02,285 --> 00:47:06,085
Speaker 2:  of the huge change that we're about to see on the web. We've seen the

719
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:09,965
Speaker 2:  problems with closed platforms and we're now in a phase I think where

720
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:13,405
Speaker 2:  there is a real push back toward the open web, but there are also really

721
00:47:13,405 --> 00:47:17,325
Speaker 2:  good reasons, If, you are part of that open web to close your

722
00:47:17,325 --> 00:47:21,205
Speaker 2:  doors. So we'll see. But my great hope, if I'm completely honest, is that

723
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:25,125
Speaker 2:  things like the internet archive and Wikipedia and all of these things continue

724
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:28,645
Speaker 2:  to be free and open because I think the idea that they are generally good

725
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:32,125
Speaker 2:  things and should continue to exist on the open internet, that feels right

726
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:35,845
Speaker 2:  to me. Alright, anyway, that is it for The Vergecast today. Thanks to
