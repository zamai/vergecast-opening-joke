Description: Danny and Steven Sanicki are twins, competitive golfers, and suddenly the biggest names in online mini golf. They started making mini golf content on TikTok about a year ago, and it took off; since then they've been trying to ride the viral wave and also turn it into something that lasts. For this episode, the first in a miniseries we're calling How To Make It In The Future, we talk to the Sanickis about their journey to turn putt-putt into their life's work — without killing the fun in the process.

00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:06,075
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast

3
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:11,715
Speaker 2:  of making this putt right now. I'm your friend David Pierce and I

4
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:15,995
Speaker 2:  am playing mini golf. I am at the East Potomac mini golf

5
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:19,675
Speaker 2:  course in I. Don't know, it's like an island between Virginia and

6
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:23,755
Speaker 2:  dc. There's really fun golf course over There, but the real fun is this mini

7
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:26,715
Speaker 2:  golf course and the key is If. you get out here early enough in the morning,

8
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:31,155
Speaker 2:  A, nobody notices you're missing work. And B, there's nobody

9
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,595
Speaker 2:  else here. So, I. Just get out, crush some 18. We're good to go.

10
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:38,595
Speaker 2:  Anyway. The reason I'm doing this here and right now is because

11
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:42,835
Speaker 2:  this episode we're about to do is actually all about mini golf. This is

12
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:46,555
Speaker 2:  the first episode in a two part mini series that we're doing that we've been

13
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:50,395
Speaker 2:  calling how to Make It in the Future and basically the idea is we wanna

14
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:54,235
Speaker 2:  talk to people and tell stories about different ways people are trying to,

15
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:58,115
Speaker 2:  well make it different kinds of creators, different kinds of businesses,

16
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:02,075
Speaker 2:  different kinds of strategies on how to be successful in this

17
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:05,395
Speaker 2:  world we live in. And for these two episodes, What we're re gonna talk about

18
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:09,355
Speaker 2:  especially is content people whose businesses make content

19
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:13,075
Speaker 2:  and people for whom that content becomes their business. And then how you

20
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:17,035
Speaker 2:  figure out how to make all of that makes sense in a way that feels

21
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,955
Speaker 2:  good and works well for you for a long time. Today's story, believe it or

22
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,835
Speaker 2:  not, is about mini golf So I figured this is work

23
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,355
Speaker 2:  today. Let's give it a whirl.

24
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:32,955
Speaker 2:  Alright, we got a lot to get to But first we're gonna take a quick break

25
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:36,275
Speaker 2:  then it's mini golf time. This is The Vergecast, we'll be right back.

26
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:21,555
Speaker 2:  three are Steven and Danny Sin and their friend Matthew.

27
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,835
Speaker 2:  Steven and Danny are twins. They're competitive golfers and at the time they

28
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:29,555
Speaker 2:  had just recently graduated From, the University of Wisconsin Parkside.

29
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:33,235
Speaker 2:  They all step up to the first hole. It's a pretty simple one, one of those

30
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:36,955
Speaker 2:  ones that's a little wavy but If, you just hit it down the middle,

31
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:40,915
Speaker 2:  you'll be fine. It's like the perfect first mini golf hole just to get you

32
00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:43,395
Speaker 2:  warmed up. Steven steps up and goes first

33
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:46,395
Speaker 5:  Nearly with a hole in one on the first hole.

34
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:47,715
Speaker 2:  Then it's Matthew's turn,

35
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:50,195
Speaker 5:  Matthew's tee shot

36
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:55,595
Speaker 5:  off the wall into a good bounce but not

37
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:56,315
Speaker 5:  enough speed

38
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:57,595
Speaker 2:  And then it's Danny,

39
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:02,125
Speaker 5:  My part to take the lead on a good line.

40
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:06,165
Speaker 5:  Lips out, brutal.

41
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:10,445
Speaker 2:  At the top of the screen the whole time they're playing, there's a neon blue

42
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:14,245
Speaker 2:  line of text that just says Mini golf tournament underneath it in like

43
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:18,445
Speaker 2:  Microsoft paint level graphics, it says each of the guys' names

44
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:22,525
Speaker 2:  and updates the score underneath it after every hole. It's So

45
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:26,565
Speaker 2:  low budget. It's kind of delightful honestly, all the names

46
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,165
Speaker 2:  are in different fonts and colors. They're not aligned at all.

47
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:34,525
Speaker 2:  Danny's score in the middle is smaller on the screen for some reason, but

48
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:38,085
Speaker 2:  there's something about it that just kind of works and it's kind of riveting.

49
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:41,965
Speaker 2:  On the second hole, Danny steps up and calls his shot that he's gonna get

50
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:45,925
Speaker 2:  a hole in one and then he doesn't. The first two

51
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,765
Speaker 2:  holes are both pretty straightforward mini golf holes, but then the guys

52
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:53,645
Speaker 2:  play a third hole at this course underneath a waterfall and with a

53
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:57,365
Speaker 2:  few posts in the way, like imagine playing mini

54
00:03:57,365 --> 00:04:01,325
Speaker 2:  golf underneath a deck that's kind of What this one looks like and

55
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,885
Speaker 2:  every time somebody hits their first shot, the camera clearly a

56
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:08,845
Speaker 2:  smartphone camera just does that abrupt zoom to follow the ball. The camera

57
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:12,205
Speaker 2:  is always behind the person in the tee box and then just sort of whoof

58
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:16,205
Speaker 2:  zooms to follow the ball towards the hole. None of it is

59
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,365
Speaker 2:  you would say well shot or beautifully produced. And

60
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:24,405
Speaker 2:  as you can hear, Danny's commentary isn't exactly like high

61
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:25,285
Speaker 2:  production value.

62
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:29,565
Speaker 5:  Corner There have some work left There Steven

63
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:30,805
Speaker 5:  or Matthew here

64
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:35,845
Speaker 5:  off the wall. The shot rolls out,

65
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:40,695
Speaker 2:  But it works, right? It really works for me. I really enjoy this video,

66
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:45,095
Speaker 2:  but more importantly it worked after the guys played the

67
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:48,775
Speaker 2:  round. Danny added all those crude scores, overlayed the commentary in

68
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:52,495
Speaker 2:  one take basically just by watching the video and talking about it

69
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:53,935
Speaker 2:  and posted it the next day

70
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:58,015
Speaker 6:  And we were kinda like, eh, that was kinda lame. Like I don't know

71
00:04:58,155 --> 00:05:01,975
Speaker 6:  how that's gonna do but I'll post it anyways, I posted it. The

72
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:05,855
Speaker 6:  first tournament we posted got 6.8 million views on TikTok and we were

73
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:08,735
Speaker 6:  like all, well let's go film another one.

74
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:12,895
Speaker 2:  That's Steven by the way, as we're talking, he's sitting at his

75
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:16,735
Speaker 2:  computer right next to Danny and they both Look and sound a lot alike.

76
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:20,495
Speaker 2:  It's confusing but we're gonna get through it. They're twins. It's complicated.

77
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,495
Speaker 2:  Oh, I should also mention, by the way, that 6.8 million number, he says

78
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:28,575
Speaker 2:  it's not just that one video that got 6.8 million views. Danny

79
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:32,695
Speaker 2:  actually posted six videos From that round over the next two days. They showed

80
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:35,895
Speaker 2:  the whole round three holes per video all in a row.

81
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:39,335
Speaker 2:  Ultimately Danny won the round pretty handily

82
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:43,375
Speaker 5:  Calling an early victory, missed it like Scotty Scheffler at

83
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:47,255
Speaker 5:  the masters. We're gonna tap this in here to secure the

84
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:51,215
Speaker 5:  victory. I shot 40, Matthew 42, Stephen 48. Thanks for

85
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:53,695
Speaker 5:  following along. Next tournament coming soon.

86
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:57,245
Speaker 2:  It's really funny to watch those six videos in order now.

87
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:01,285
Speaker 2:  Danny edited them all back to back, but you can literally see him getting

88
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:05,205
Speaker 2:  better as he goes by the sixth video. All the scorecards are

89
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:09,085
Speaker 2:  even and the same color and Danny had stopped making scoring mistakes

90
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:12,845
Speaker 2:  like he did that you just heard there's still a lot of jump cutting and rack

91
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:17,085
Speaker 2:  focusing, but that seems to be part of the Look rather than kind of not

92
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,965
Speaker 2:  knowing What, you're doing So. Yeah, six videos, two days,

93
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:25,445
Speaker 2:  6.8 million views. Danny and Steven I don't think realized that

94
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:29,365
Speaker 2:  this series was gonna do numbers but they did understand pretty quickly

95
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:33,125
Speaker 2:  What, most creators understand pretty quickly you gotta just

96
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:37,165
Speaker 2:  keep posting. They'd been making golf content together for a while,

97
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:41,085
Speaker 2:  Steven said and they had been planning for a while to make some kind of

98
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,005
Speaker 2:  career out of it.

99
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:46,405
Speaker 6:  We started about three and a half years ago, actually about three

100
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,925
Speaker 6:  years ago now, and we were doing golf

101
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,805
Speaker 6:  simulator stuff at our school when we were in college.

102
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:56,525
Speaker 6:  We were kind of getting interested in social media.

103
00:06:57,265 --> 00:07:00,605
Speaker 2:  If you've ever seen a golf video on TikTok, you know roughly What, those

104
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:04,485
Speaker 2:  early videos Look like people hitting balls into a screen

105
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:08,325
Speaker 2:  indoors, which simulates where they go on a real course or playing on

106
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,885
Speaker 2:  actual round of golf with the shot tracer and all that good stuff.

107
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:16,125
Speaker 2:  Golf content is huge all around the internet and the snicky are good

108
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,965
Speaker 2:  golfers but in like a relatable way So, it certainly seems

109
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:23,885
Speaker 2:  plausible that they could have pulled it off. Danny even had one video of

110
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:26,365
Speaker 2:  his regular golf game go slightly viral.

111
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:30,885
Speaker 6:  I had posted one video of me golfing in high school that my high

112
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:34,795
Speaker 6:  school golf coach took and it started getting a bunch of views

113
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:38,435
Speaker 6:  overnight and I showed Steve and I was like Look at this and we were like,

114
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,435
Speaker 6:  wow, like What What. Can we do to expand So? We started off with doing

115
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:43,195
Speaker 6:  our golf stuff.

116
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:46,795
Speaker 2:  Did you think on that first video like, oh I'm gonna post this in, a lot

117
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:49,715
Speaker 2:  of people are gonna watch it because a lot of people like golf content like

118
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:53,355
Speaker 2:  What, I, I feel like that I would not personally have

119
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:56,755
Speaker 2:  guessed that like I posted a random video, From my high school golf career

120
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,435
Speaker 2:  is like how you launch a social media universe. But maybe I'm wrong, like

121
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:03,635
Speaker 2:  did you, did you have high ambitions when you posted that first video? Well

122
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:07,555
Speaker 6:  I I probably posted about 25 videos before and nothing did that well,

123
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:10,635
Speaker 6:  okay, So I didn't think anything different of this post, although it was

124
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:14,715
Speaker 6:  a little bit cooler of a post There were a lot of people in the background

125
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:18,835
Speaker 6:  watching I made The putt, So I didn't think anything

126
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:22,035
Speaker 6:  was gonna do well with it, but when I woke up the next morning and it had

127
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:25,715
Speaker 6:  a bunch of views, I was like, well maybe we found

128
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:29,595
Speaker 6:  something. But We didn't have many more clips to post From high school 'cause

129
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:33,555
Speaker 6:  we were in college and So. It kind of just took off From There

130
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:37,075
Speaker 6:  and then We started doing our live streaming on TikTok

131
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:41,595
Speaker 6:  and we were kind of thinking We were, we enjoyed live streaming but we

132
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:44,635
Speaker 6:  wanted to find a way that we could just be content creators

133
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:49,195
Speaker 2:  Other than a couple of those little pops and the sort of consistent live

134
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,155
Speaker 2:  streaming stuff, the golf content wasn't exactly exploding for the

135
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:56,765
Speaker 2:  guys. You won't know this If, you don't care about golf, but There are a

136
00:08:56,765 --> 00:09:00,685
Speaker 2:  lot of golf creators out There and increasingly like the

137
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:03,925
Speaker 2:  pros are becoming creators themselves. Hey

Speaker 7:  Guys, this is Bryson de Shambo and welcome back to my channel.

Speaker 2:  Donald Trump. Honestly, we could do a whole episode about his

145
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:34,125
Speaker 2:  arc as a creator and maybe we should kind of a fun idea, but Anyway,

146
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:38,325
Speaker 2:  the point is the golf space is extremely competitive

147
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:41,685
Speaker 2:  and full honestly the mini golf space

148
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,485
Speaker 2:  less So So, maybe it's not surprising that it was the mini golf videos that

149
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:50,525
Speaker 2:  first popped for the sies, but the thing is, after a few years

150
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:53,725
Speaker 2:  of making videos trying and trying to find the thing,

151
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:58,005
Speaker 2:  having a big hit feels pretty great even when it's not the one

152
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:01,765
Speaker 2:  you expected. That first hit also brings up one of the moments that

153
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:05,205
Speaker 2:  a lot of creators go through I think you start out making the kinds of stuff

154
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,325
Speaker 2:  you wanna make, the things you've been planning and thinking about for forever,

155
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:12,925
Speaker 2:  then something you make takes off. Sometimes it's exactly What you'd always

156
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:16,805
Speaker 2:  wanted and planned and hoped for. Sometimes frankly, I think more often it's

157
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:20,605
Speaker 2:  like a weird throwaway joke or something you just made on a

158
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:23,565
Speaker 2:  whim and didn't think about. You're always making content. You post something,

159
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,845
Speaker 2:  it goes nuts, the internet and the algorithms are unpredictable that way,

160
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:32,005
Speaker 2:  but then it happens and now you're left with a question, do you keep doing

161
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:35,645
Speaker 2:  What? You were doing What, you kind of came here to do, or do you go with

162
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:39,005
Speaker 2:  What works? Do you double down? Do you triple down

163
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,405
Speaker 2:  and If you decide to do that. How do you take this thing that for some

164
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:47,565
Speaker 2:  unknown, maybe unknowable reason, pleased the algorithm

165
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:51,765
Speaker 2:  gods and turn that thing into your Life and is

166
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:55,495
Speaker 2:  turning that thing into your Life, even What you want, I'm making this sound

167
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:59,455
Speaker 2:  kind of existential because I think it is and I think very few creators

168
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:03,575
Speaker 2:  see this moment coming, but it always seems to come. My

169
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:07,215
Speaker 2:  favorite example of this is all the people who were like video game

170
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:11,135
Speaker 2:  streamers on YouTube but then during the Johnny Depp Amber Heard trial in

171
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:14,495
Speaker 2:  2022 started putting up daily recaps of the trial.

172
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:18,775
Speaker 2:  They didn't do this because they had deep passion for Johnny

173
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:22,335
Speaker 2:  Depp. Amber heard trial coverage, they did it because it worked. You see

174
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:25,975
Speaker 2:  other people getting views with trial takes you do a trial, take some

175
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,175
Speaker 2:  subscribers might think it's weird to see it on your channel, but it gets

176
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:33,015
Speaker 2:  views and So you keep going and at some point you have to Look at yourself

177
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:36,495
Speaker 2:  and say, okay, am I a video game streamer or am I a much more

178
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:40,415
Speaker 2:  successful court reporter? It's a tough question to answer because There

179
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,015
Speaker 2:  are big costs and big trade offs on both sides of that.

180
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:47,895
Speaker 2:  To be fair, the syn didn't have to make quite that intense a decision.

181
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:52,015
Speaker 2:  They went From regular golf to mini golf, you know it's like a much straighter

182
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:55,645
Speaker 2:  line and they could keep making regular golf content on their

183
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:59,525
Speaker 2:  channels and it would still make sense in context. So in that sense. It was

184
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:01,085
Speaker 2:  actually a pretty easy transition

185
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:05,685
Speaker 6:  Right after that first tournament. We both looked at each other and

186
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:09,325
Speaker 6:  we were like, this is it. Like let's do it. And

187
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,045
Speaker 6:  it's fun because it is a form of golf and

188
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:17,565
Speaker 6:  it's intense and it's all of our videos kind of

189
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:21,245
Speaker 6:  revolve around a competition or a challenge. So

190
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,645
Speaker 6:  we knew right There that hey, we're gonna enjoy mini golf

191
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,285
Speaker 6:  and let's do it So,

192
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,845
Speaker 2:  Were you like mini golfers? Anyway like I feel like every golfer plays mini

193
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:35,005
Speaker 2:  golf, right? It's like I I like mini golf I just played the Tiger Woods mini

194
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,765
Speaker 2:  golf thing for the first time. That was bananas.

195
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:42,965
Speaker 2:  But like is this like a thing you guys would normally do or

196
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:45,045
Speaker 2:  do you like wake up one day and you're like, let's go make a video at mini

197
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:46,005
Speaker 2:  golf and and see.

198
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:49,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I would say we weren't too into mini golf

199
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:54,005
Speaker 6:  prior to starting to film and then we

200
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:57,765
Speaker 6:  started to figure out all the courses in the area, all the good

201
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:01,725
Speaker 6:  courses around the country and, but

202
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,535
Speaker 6:  no, it was just more of a thing we'd maybe

203
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:07,855
Speaker 6:  do once a year, twice a year.

204
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:11,695
Speaker 2:  It's like a vacation thing. I feel like you, you like go, you play mini golf

205
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:14,015
Speaker 2:  when you're like on family vacations and that's kind of it.

206
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:18,095
Speaker 6:  Yeah, exactly. Okay. So. Yeah, no it wasn't

207
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:21,735
Speaker 6:  What We thought, but We wanted to try something new because

208
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:26,175
Speaker 6:  it's always nice to give your viewers something fresh or something

209
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:30,055
Speaker 6:  new. So, we tried it and it turned out to

210
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:33,975
Speaker 6:  be our niche and it's also more competitive than

211
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:37,295
Speaker 6:  golf. I would say some of the people that We play mini golf with

212
00:13:37,665 --> 00:13:41,055
Speaker 6:  don't really have a chance against us in golf, but in mini golf

213
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:44,895
Speaker 6:  it's a lot more competitive and anybody can win

214
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:49,055
Speaker 2:  So. Yeah, they pretty quickly decided to go hard on mini golf content

215
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:53,255
Speaker 2:  they did and do still make a lot of regular golf content too, but they knew

216
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:56,735
Speaker 2:  immediately that people loved watching mini golf So. They filmed another

217
00:13:56,735 --> 00:14:00,695
Speaker 2:  round, posted it, got views, filmed another posted it got views, theory,

218
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:04,615
Speaker 2:  proven kind of, but then this is another moment you get

219
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:08,015
Speaker 2:  to as a creator where you have to figure out not just whether to keep doing

220
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:11,655
Speaker 2:  the thing that got views but why it got views in the first place.

221
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,815
Speaker 2:  That requires understanding at a deep and specific level

222
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:20,255
Speaker 2:  and a replicable level for that matter. What makes something work on

223
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:23,975
Speaker 2:  the internet and that is really, really hard to do.

224
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:26,935
Speaker 2:  Like If, you were to try and explain why this video

225
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:31,415
Speaker 8:  Go crazy every time that you do. Oh you gotta give him that hawk to and spit

226
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:32,015
Speaker 8:  on that thing

227
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:37,375
Speaker 2:  Became the hottest thing on the internet in many years and tried

228
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,975
Speaker 2:  to back that into a formula that you could repeat again.

229
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,255
Speaker 2:  I bet you couldn't do it. I really do I. Don't think you could do it. I mean

230
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:48,215
Speaker 2:  the video's funny, but There are a lot of funny things out There and would

231
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:51,885
Speaker 2:  you have guessed frankly the first time that you saw this video that Hay

232
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,565
Speaker 2:  Welch the hawk to a girl herself would now have a giant hit podcasts

233
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:59,725
Speaker 2:  and still be famous all these months later? If, you would have

234
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:03,245
Speaker 2:  call me I, have lots of questions for you. The difference between getting

235
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:07,165
Speaker 2:  it right and getting it wrong in those moments when you're taking off

236
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:11,045
Speaker 2:  is the difference between being a meme forever and being a

237
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:15,005
Speaker 2:  celebrity forever. People will either know you as the name of your meme,

238
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,565
Speaker 2:  like you're the scumbag Steve Guy or the kombucha girl or

239
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:22,685
Speaker 2:  the meme just becomes part of the story of how you became like Lil

240
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:26,605
Speaker 2:  Nas X. It can go one way or the other and there's

241
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:30,685
Speaker 2:  not that much wiggle room between, but figuring out why people

242
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:34,645
Speaker 2:  liked your videos is hard. Even when it's just three guys playing

243
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:38,605
Speaker 2:  mini golf. It can be tempting in a lot of ways to not think about it and

244
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,085
Speaker 2:  just kind of keep doing What you're doing and trust that it'll keep working,

245
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:45,325
Speaker 2:  but eventually you do have to try and sit down and figure out What are we

246
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:49,165
Speaker 2:  doing that works? I asked the guys about this and Danny said he

247
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:49,605
Speaker 2:  has a theory.

248
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:54,085
Speaker 6:  I think that just like how the video was produced,

249
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:58,325
Speaker 6:  it could have just been a video of us mini golfing with no

250
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:02,205
Speaker 6:  voiceover or anything on top of it, just us hitting a ball,

251
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:07,005
Speaker 6:  but I think What added to it was the voiceovers kind of

252
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:10,925
Speaker 6:  making you feel like you're There like something's on the line. This is super

253
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:14,725
Speaker 6:  intense, just it really adds a lot to the videos.

254
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:19,445
Speaker 6:  So, I, I, I don't know a hundred percent What, it was I mean it wasn't

255
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:22,405
Speaker 6:  anything crazy, it wasn't a special tournament, nothing

256
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:27,725
Speaker 6:  insane happened but I think just the voiceover kind of

257
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:31,645
Speaker 6:  brings people in and really makes them understand what's kind of

258
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:35,485
Speaker 6:  going on in the videos and also having every shot

259
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:39,965
Speaker 6:  recorded clearly you see every pot where it ends up So.

260
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,685
Speaker 6:  It's not like, oh is maybe

261
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,805
Speaker 6:  cheating or this isn't legit So I think just

262
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:52,005
Speaker 6:  the way that it was produced and kinda edited

263
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:56,125
Speaker 6:  with clear scores on top and to see where everybody stands

264
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,005
Speaker 6:  and who's gonna win was thrilling to

265
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:00,525
Speaker 6:  viewers.

266
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:03,285
Speaker 2:  Steven also has a theory right

267
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:06,445
Speaker 6:  Now. I would say our bracket style tournaments are

268
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:10,845
Speaker 6:  sort of our best performing I. Think head-to-head matches

269
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:15,445
Speaker 6:  are something that a lot of viewers like So. We try to post those at the

270
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:19,325
Speaker 6:  start of a month in hopes that they perform the best

271
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:22,245
Speaker 2:  And Danny actually has another theory. If

272
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:26,045
Speaker 6:  Someone makes a hole in one at the start of a video, I'll and someone

273
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:29,805
Speaker 6:  else's ball isn't on the screen. I'll try to put that first. Maybe

274
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:33,885
Speaker 6:  I like to think that a hole in one sometimes brings the viewers in a little

275
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:37,645
Speaker 6:  bit more and might help the algorithm. So just kind of

276
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,765
Speaker 6:  experimenting with different clips and sometimes people get mad like he

277
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:45,485
Speaker 6:  wasn't supposed to go first There, but I mix the clips up when we're playing,

278
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,645
Speaker 6:  it's all right, but sometimes when I edit it, things

279
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:49,725
Speaker 4:  Get a little mixed

280
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:53,365
Speaker 2:  Around whatever it was in that video, whether it was the way it was produced

281
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:56,765
Speaker 2:  or the way the tournament was put together or the way the scoreboard looked,

282
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:01,165
Speaker 2:  it worked. So, the guys kept doing it more and more and more of it all the

283
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:04,845
Speaker 2:  time and it kept working. We'll talk about What that looks like and I also

284
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:08,285
Speaker 2:  have a theory on why it all worked as well as it did. But. first we have

285
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:09,645
Speaker 2:  to take a break. We'll be right back.

Speaker 2:  play it at big puts, which is their local course. In Greenfield, Wisconsin,

292
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:44,525
Speaker 2:  every hole There seems to be visual in an unusual way.

293
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:48,565
Speaker 2:  On one you have to hit the ball through a halfpipe with skateboards in the

294
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:52,205
Speaker 2:  middle as obstacles. There's another one where there's a loop that you have

295
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:55,045
Speaker 2:  to smash the ball through and that loop is made out of a huge truck tire,

296
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:58,725
Speaker 2:  which is really cool. One hole makes you hit the ball through two

297
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:02,805
Speaker 2:  different sets of bowling pin obstacles and the hole is in the

298
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:06,605
Speaker 2:  middle of all the bowling pins. I've never played a course like that or

299
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,085
Speaker 2:  that course for that matter, but it's really fun to watch this course and

300
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,485
Speaker 2:  I find myself sitting There thinking about where I would hit the ball to

301
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:17,365
Speaker 2:  try and get the angle just right. It's not like the NBA or the NFL,

302
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:21,085
Speaker 2:  you know where you're essentially watching another species play the game.

303
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:24,925
Speaker 2:  I can play mini golf. I can totally get a hole in one. I could beat those

304
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:28,845
Speaker 2:  guys. That last part, by the way, I think matters a lot. Both

305
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:32,245
Speaker 2:  Danny and Steven told me that they get a lot of comments, From people basically

306
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:35,365
Speaker 2:  trash talking about how they could beat them on a course, which is part of

307
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:38,885
Speaker 2:  What keeps it fun and exciting. People being too good at things

308
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:43,325
Speaker 2:  might be bad content. The more I think about it and the more I watch,

309
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:46,285
Speaker 2:  the more it actually doesn't surprise me at all that mini golf would work

310
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:49,445
Speaker 2:  on social. It is fundamentally a vertical screen game.

311
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:53,205
Speaker 2:  Anyway, that's all really easy for me to say in retrospect, having watched

312
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:57,125
Speaker 2:  a year of this content now, right when the Syne first posted their

313
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,165
Speaker 2:  mini golf tournament to TikTok, they definitely didn't think it was going

314
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:03,885
Speaker 2:  to be huge. The best evidence I have for that, by the way, is that they posted

315
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:07,965
Speaker 2:  it on Danny's personal channel, not their more official twin

316
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:11,925
Speaker 2:  tour golf channel, but also maybe because they assumed it wasn't

317
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:15,125
Speaker 2:  gonna do well and they didn't want to cause any problems for the main channel.

318
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:19,245
Speaker 2:  Uploading videos that don't work is death, but it did do well

319
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:23,365
Speaker 2:  and suddenly the at Danny Syn account became synonymous with twin

320
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:27,445
Speaker 2:  tour golf and with this huge increase in views for mini

321
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:31,285
Speaker 2:  golf. Steven swears he's not jealous that it's Danny's name

322
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:35,125
Speaker 2:  on the channel, but I don't think I believe him. Anyway. At first it

323
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:39,005
Speaker 2:  was just Danny's TikTok doing all these mini golf numbers, but the guys

324
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:42,045
Speaker 2:  took this whole thing cross platform pretty fast.

325
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:46,525
Speaker 6:  So when We saw Danny's account kind of taking off,

326
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:51,205
Speaker 6:  we were like, wow. And then we weren't posting

327
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:55,285
Speaker 6:  that on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, We weren't posting

328
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:59,045
Speaker 6:  it right away, and I'd say it was about three weeks

329
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:03,205
Speaker 6:  after that first tournament when We were like, we

330
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:06,765
Speaker 6:  gotta start putting this on all the other platforms to

331
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:10,285
Speaker 6:  help those grow as well. So. Then we started putting it onto

332
00:22:10,515 --> 00:22:14,325
Speaker 6:  Instagram, doing long form videos on YouTube

333
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:18,525
Speaker 6:  and then we started to get monetized on YouTube and

334
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:23,045
Speaker 6:  it really started to pick up So. Just pushing our

335
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:26,685
Speaker 6:  content onto all platforms was our next step after

336
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,925
Speaker 6:  about three weeks of seeing the numbers that Danny's TikTok was doing.

337
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,205
Speaker 2:  Now Steven says the goal is to post roughly 20 videos a day across all

338
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:39,325
Speaker 2:  platforms. They aim for three tiktoks a day, lots of posts on

339
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:43,125
Speaker 2:  Instagram, Facebook, and the rest, and 28 long forum

340
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:47,005
Speaker 2:  YouTube videos a month 28. And in putting out

341
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:50,805
Speaker 2:  all of this stuff, they've sort of by accident built a whole

342
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:54,325
Speaker 2:  system for trying new things, seeing What works, testing

343
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:58,125
Speaker 2:  algorithms and relentlessly optimizing their whole content

344
00:22:58,275 --> 00:22:59,685
Speaker 2:  operation all the time.

345
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:03,965
Speaker 6:  What's So fun about our YouTube page is people watch whatever

346
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,885
Speaker 6:  content we put on There So, just kind of experimenting with

347
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:10,845
Speaker 6:  some new challenges, some new style of videos,

348
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:15,325
Speaker 6:  but continuing the mini golf seasons

349
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:19,685
Speaker 6:  and everything on TikTok, short form content and

350
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:23,525
Speaker 6:  just being able to experiment with new ideas. and we also have Steven's

351
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:27,285
Speaker 6:  page for if we wanna implement new challenges, mini

352
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:30,685
Speaker 6:  golf challenges, we can post them on his account without getting in the way

353
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:34,925
Speaker 6:  of all the mini golf tournaments. We've just seen too much success

354
00:23:34,925 --> 00:23:38,845
Speaker 6:  with it to change it up. So, it's nice to have multiple accounts,

355
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:43,085
Speaker 6:  my account just continuing to be the tournaments and then

356
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:47,405
Speaker 6:  experimenting on other platforms and then also this

357
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:51,005
Speaker 6:  winter, unfortunately in Wisconsin it gets cold and

358
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:54,885
Speaker 6:  courses close So, we'll travel, it's like

359
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:58,765
Speaker 6:  What We did last year. We found spots where we could go

360
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:02,645
Speaker 6:  mini golf So, we'll definitely be doing some travel. We have some courses

361
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:06,725
Speaker 6:  that we wanna hit in like Myrtle Beach is

362
00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:10,605
Speaker 6:  like the mini golf capital So just traveling around

363
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:14,485
Speaker 6:  and continuing to get our content over the winter and then we always have

364
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:18,365
Speaker 6:  the indoor course by us as a backup and a

365
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:21,805
Speaker 6:  course that I'm sure we'll be at quite a bit this winter.

366
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:26,405
Speaker 2:  That's such an interesting description of the whole social media world, isn't

367
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:30,205
Speaker 2:  it? YouTube is the place where people are able to most closely connect with

368
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:33,925
Speaker 2:  the channels. They like So. If you're a creator, you have fans and they'll

369
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:37,765
Speaker 2:  see and watch the things that you publish. Everything else everywhere else

370
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:41,525
Speaker 2:  is mostly just about playing the games of the algorithm,

371
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:45,525
Speaker 2:  but If, you play the games and lose them on your main channel, you could

372
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:49,445
Speaker 2:  end up in real trouble. So, you have to build a whole pipeline that

373
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:53,205
Speaker 2:  eventually lands the best stuff and only the best stuff on your most

374
00:24:53,205 --> 00:24:56,965
Speaker 2:  important platform and for the syn, that most important platform

375
00:24:57,115 --> 00:24:59,725
Speaker 2:  that leads when it comes to the mini golf is TikTok.

376
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:04,045
Speaker 6:  Really everything just gets posted to TikTok first and then

377
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:07,885
Speaker 6:  Steven will take it From, TikTok, throw it onto Instagram,

378
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:12,365
Speaker 6:  and then when we do post it on YouTube, it's a

379
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:16,445
Speaker 6:  fresh voiceover, it's a new voiceover So. It's pretty

380
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:19,525
Speaker 6:  similar but maybe a few different talking points

381
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:24,365
Speaker 6:  for our YouTube viewers, but really it just kind of gets posted all

382
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:28,245
Speaker 6:  the same to all different platforms and it's interesting to see how

383
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:32,165
Speaker 6:  each one grows. Sometimes a video on Instagram will go viral

384
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:36,085
Speaker 6:  but it won't go viral on TikTok, but sometimes

385
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:40,005
Speaker 6:  usually we see the same thing. If a video does well on TikTok,

386
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:43,925
Speaker 6:  it most likely performs well on Instagram and then

387
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:47,645
Speaker 6:  YouTube is just pretty consistent, just we're

388
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:51,405
Speaker 6:  continuing to grow our YouTube page and we're starting to see more success

389
00:25:51,405 --> 00:25:53,045
Speaker 6:  with it as we go. Okay.

390
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:56,885
Speaker 2:  Have you, have you developed a pretty good theory of what's gonna work and

391
00:25:56,885 --> 00:26:00,845
Speaker 2:  What doesn't like when you post something, can you usually predict whether

392
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:02,365
Speaker 2:  it's gonna hit big or not?

393
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:07,035
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I would say So, although right now on Instagram

394
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:10,955
Speaker 6:  there's a match between Steven and Carter that

395
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:15,595
Speaker 6:  there's two videos with a bunch of views like 800,000

396
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,355
Speaker 6:  and 300,000 and on TikTok it didn't

397
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:23,035
Speaker 6:  perform as well as that So. It's all kind of a

398
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:27,035
Speaker 6:  gamble and I, sometimes I like to think I know, but then I'm like,

399
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:27,955
Speaker 6:  wait, maybe I don't know.

400
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:32,335
Speaker 2:  Carter is another new entrant to the twin tour universe. He won

401
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:35,455
Speaker 2:  a tournament, the guys threw for some fans who wanted to play with the twin

402
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:39,215
Speaker 2:  tour guys, like I said, people like talking trash to Steven and Danny and

403
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:41,535
Speaker 2:  telling them that they're better So, they gave him a chance to be better,

404
00:26:41,995 --> 00:26:45,885
Speaker 2:  the tournament went great and they want to do more of them both as a way

405
00:26:45,885 --> 00:26:49,565
Speaker 2:  to make money and as a way to generate even more content to put on their

406
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:53,525
Speaker 2:  channels because as I said, the only thing that is always true about

407
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:56,765
Speaker 2:  every content platform is that There is no such thing as too much content.

408
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:01,005
Speaker 2:  Over the course of the last year, Steven and Danny have really started

409
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:05,045
Speaker 2:  to think more strategically about What they're doing, not just

410
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:08,845
Speaker 2:  making mini golf content and putting it out, not even just making lots of

411
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:12,285
Speaker 2:  mini golf content and putting it out, but really trying to set this thing

412
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:16,205
Speaker 2:  up to succeed in a much bigger way for a much longer

413
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:20,045
Speaker 2:  time. Because really in any moment when you as a creator

414
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:23,405
Speaker 2:  are having that first viral hit moment,

415
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:28,125
Speaker 2:  you can kind of pick two things. You can either do one or the other,

416
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:31,965
Speaker 2:  you can keep the thing going as long as possible knowing that nothing on

417
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:35,845
Speaker 2:  the internet lasts forever. Or you can try and leverage that

418
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:38,965
Speaker 2:  moment of virality to build something more

419
00:27:39,155 --> 00:27:43,005
Speaker 2:  sustainable. Steven and Danny tried to do both pretty quickly.

420
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:47,005
Speaker 2:  They decided to make their golf content their full-time jobs and they started

421
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:49,925
Speaker 2:  to structure their lives in a way that could make that work.

422
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:54,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah, So. Typically Monday through Wednesday

423
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:58,285
Speaker 6:  well wanna film a U, at least a YouTube video

424
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:03,725
Speaker 6:  and we shoot for a a few regular season tournaments early

425
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:07,605
Speaker 6:  in the weeks and then kind of the schedule of everyone

426
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:11,445
Speaker 6:  that plays with us, they have jobs, they have other things

427
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:15,085
Speaker 6:  going on. So, we typically try to film

428
00:28:15,495 --> 00:28:19,485
Speaker 6:  after work or on a weekend if it's a big major or

429
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:23,005
Speaker 6:  a bracket style tournament where we're, we have eight players in the field,

430
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,285
Speaker 6:  we'll try to do those on the weekend, but other than that,

431
00:28:27,745 --> 00:28:31,565
Speaker 6:  So, we try to find times that work for everyone and then when we're not

432
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:34,725
Speaker 6:  filming we're always editing or doing

433
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:38,205
Speaker 6:  voiceovers and uploading all the content.

434
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:42,725
Speaker 2:  This all sounds like a lot of work to me. I tried a bunch of different times

435
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:46,725
Speaker 2:  in our interview to get the Syne twins to tell me how grueling and terrible

436
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:50,405
Speaker 2:  this job is, but they just wouldn't do it. I genuinely think they're having

437
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:54,405
Speaker 2:  a good time, but they did acknowledge how helpful it is to have each other

438
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:58,725
Speaker 2:  and that they found a pretty good two-man balance to get all of this

439
00:28:58,725 --> 00:28:58,925
Speaker 2:  done.

440
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:03,125
Speaker 6:  So, we've figured out day to day So Danny only

441
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:07,245
Speaker 6:  edits the mini golf tournaments and posts 'em on his page and then he'll

442
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:11,085
Speaker 6:  do all the long form mini golf voiceovers for

443
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:14,445
Speaker 6:  YouTube and then I'll take everything and put 'em onto

444
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:19,245
Speaker 6:  Instagram, YouTube shorts and then I'll

445
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:22,885
Speaker 6:  do my golf content and I'll record and edit

446
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:27,325
Speaker 6:  all of that. So we found timing What takes Danny

447
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:31,205
Speaker 6:  at the same time that it takes me to do my work. So We We

448
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:34,005
Speaker 6:  split it pretty much What We think 50 50

449
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,445
Speaker 6:  to continue to upload content

450
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:41,335
Speaker 2:  That makes sense, which is easier to shoot mini golf or regular golf.

451
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:48,095
Speaker 6:  Probably mini golf because it's So quick or or a

452
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:51,975
Speaker 6:  lot quicker than golf content. And then golf when we're recording, if

453
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:55,815
Speaker 6:  we're waiting on a group in front of us or the course is

454
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:59,775
Speaker 6:  super busy and we're kind of like, oh, like let's go like

455
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:04,095
Speaker 6:  somewhat gets stressful, but that's why we always find times when

456
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:08,375
Speaker 6:  it's not gonna be busy. So, we always film during the week

457
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:12,175
Speaker 6:  when we can, especially golf content. We'll never

458
00:30:12,205 --> 00:30:14,655
Speaker 6:  film on a weekend when everyone's out. There

459
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:19,095
Speaker 2:  Danny is really the one in charge of the mini golf tiktoks, which are currently

460
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:22,895
Speaker 2:  the centerpiece of the whole operation and over the last year he and Steven

461
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:26,855
Speaker 2:  have been thinking a lot about how to improve the way they film the tournaments

462
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:27,055
Speaker 2:  too.

463
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:31,615
Speaker 6:  So, every clip we've filmed since September 4th of last

464
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:35,175
Speaker 6:  year has been done by either Danny or I. We film

465
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:39,495
Speaker 6:  all the mini golf tournaments passing the phone back and forth

466
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:40,175
Speaker 6:  to record.

467
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:43,655
Speaker 2:  Is that why you're hardly ever playing at the same time? Yep. I was wondering

468
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:44,215
Speaker 2:  about this. Okay,

469
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,255
Speaker 6:  And then people think Danny and I are the same person

470
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:51,095
Speaker 6:  because you never see the other person behind, right?

471
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:55,055
Speaker 6:  So, but no, we We know how We want

472
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:59,535
Speaker 6:  the camera to Look the angles and we always have to leave

473
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:03,615
Speaker 6:  some room at the top for the scoreboard, So just making sure

474
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:06,775
Speaker 6:  everything is recorded how we want it.

475
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,535
Speaker 2:  How do you want it d just like sort of describe as best you can. What, you

476
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,295
Speaker 2:  want that to Look like

477
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:15,575
Speaker 6:  Yeah, So you always, we want the ball in the middle of the screen when

478
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:19,535
Speaker 6:  it's rolling and never too far down

479
00:31:19,675 --> 00:31:23,415
Speaker 6:  So the scoreboard covers the hole and you can't see a shot or something.

480
00:31:24,075 --> 00:31:27,815
Speaker 6:  So and always, yeah, we just have our angles and

481
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:31,855
Speaker 6:  we know From playing courses. What angle

482
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:35,775
Speaker 6:  to start the hole on if you're behind the hole, behind the

483
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:38,575
Speaker 6:  player ha at the halfway point of the hole

484
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:43,285
Speaker 6:  just So. We don't miss anything at all.

485
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:47,005
Speaker 6:  So. And also just make sure the ball never goes out of frame.

486
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:51,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What, do you ever like sneakily retake a shot if you're like, oh, I

487
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:54,205
Speaker 2:  missed it, I didn't move the camera fast enough like take, hit that one again.

488
00:31:54,435 --> 00:31:58,205
Speaker 6:  Like there's been a time where you, you think it might be recording,

489
00:31:58,515 --> 00:32:02,205
Speaker 6:  someone hits a shot and then you realize it's not recording and

490
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:05,845
Speaker 6:  we'll go grab the ball. So it's like, hey, it would've ended up here.

491
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:09,925
Speaker 6:  It's like, nope, we don't know where it would've stopped but

492
00:32:10,465 --> 00:32:13,805
Speaker 6:  we hardly now that we've been doing it for over a year

493
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:16,525
Speaker 6:  run into many issues.

494
00:32:17,975 --> 00:32:21,805
Speaker 2:  Would you ever like, is There a next level up? Like you,

495
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:25,045
Speaker 2:  you could, you know get out, go out and get a person with like a fancy camera

496
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,845
Speaker 2:  and a steady cam to be like running after you as you go down the course.

497
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:31,845
Speaker 2:  Like is that, would, would that help? Is that even a a thing you would

498
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:32,445
Speaker 2:  want to do

499
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:37,165
Speaker 6:  I? Think for our YouTube content possibly for filming

500
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:41,325
Speaker 6:  horizontally I, think maybe someday

501
00:32:41,455 --> 00:32:45,325
Speaker 6:  we'll upgrade to a camera, but with how much content we're pumping out the

502
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:48,325
Speaker 6:  phone and just being able to edit on my phone,

503
00:32:49,345 --> 00:32:53,245
Speaker 6:  export it, From my phone up to YouTube, TikTok, whatever, it's just everything

504
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:57,245
Speaker 6:  So quick, it's saves time. So right now and I think the

505
00:32:57,245 --> 00:32:59,005
Speaker 6:  iPhone camera is unbeatable.

506
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:03,445
Speaker 2:  I actually I. I've also I, I've started to believe that especially

507
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:07,365
Speaker 2:  on social like Instagram and TikTok, that actually There is such

508
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:10,405
Speaker 2:  a thing as like it can Look too good and and it feels weird

509
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,085
Speaker 2:  when you see So something that is like clearly professionally shot on TikTok.

510
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:17,645
Speaker 2:  You're like, why is this, why'd you try So hard? Like just, just shoot it

511
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:18,605
Speaker 2:  on your phone, it'll be fine

512
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:23,245
Speaker 6:  You, yeah, So, we We did use the

513
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:27,045
Speaker 6:  camera a little bit before We started mini golf for our long form

514
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:30,525
Speaker 6:  YouTube videos, but now just Danny

515
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:34,565
Speaker 6:  believes in the iPhone and he's got me to believe that it's

516
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:38,525
Speaker 6:  our best option, especially for the short form content like you said,

517
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:42,965
Speaker 6:  with just having a normal phone video for a TikTok

518
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:46,925
Speaker 6:  rather than a very high quality, something that looks

519
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:49,165
Speaker 6:  out of place on the short form apps.

520
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:53,565
Speaker 2:  Danny really does do the whole thing on his phone, all the editing, the

521
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:57,445
Speaker 2:  voiceover, the scoreboards, it all just happens in the Cap Cut app and

522
00:33:57,445 --> 00:34:01,325
Speaker 2:  Danny has developed a very specific way of doing everything, especially his

523
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:01,765
Speaker 2:  commentary.

524
00:34:02,495 --> 00:34:06,405
Speaker 6:  Every voiceover is really at this point I try to do

525
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:10,045
Speaker 6:  'em in one take. Just kind of what's kind of keep it natural, what's

526
00:34:10,235 --> 00:34:13,765
Speaker 6:  What I'm thinking What I'm seeing and not trying to make it perfect.

527
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:18,125
Speaker 6:  It could be There for hours and hours with how much content we post.

528
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:21,925
Speaker 6:  It's just really I try to do it in one take. I will, I'll probably mess up

529
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:26,285
Speaker 6:  one every three but then I'll just go back undo something and

530
00:34:26,575 --> 00:34:30,205
Speaker 6:  start From, There, So. It's fun trying to do 'em in one take

531
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:34,485
Speaker 6:  and I know that Danny does read a lot of the comments.

532
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:38,485
Speaker 6:  So he'll get ideas, From, What people are commenting or

533
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:41,765
Speaker 6:  stuff like that to implement in his voiceover.

534
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:44,645
Speaker 2:  What's one you've added? Do you have like a new catchphrase or work shopping

535
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:44,925
Speaker 2:  right now?

536
00:34:46,245 --> 00:34:50,165
Speaker 6:  I? Honestly, it's not. There's nothing really stirring right now.

537
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:54,125
Speaker 6:  No, but before What was popular and still is, is

538
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:57,765
Speaker 6:  Bella's pumped up? I I. Don't know how I thought about that, but

539
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:01,405
Speaker 6:  she's really, she doesn't Look pumped up but she is pumped up.

540
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:05,365
Speaker 2:  Bella by the way, is Steven's fiance and is one of the main

541
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:09,285
Speaker 2:  recurring characters in these tournaments. She often shows up

542
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:13,205
Speaker 2:  in scrubs and she seems somewhere between kind of disinterested and

543
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:17,445
Speaker 2:  entirely annoyed about being There and then frequently just dominates everybody.

544
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:21,445
Speaker 2:  If you believe the comments and the twin tours, merch sales of the Bella's

545
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:24,765
Speaker 2:  pumped up T-shirts, she's everybody's favorite player to root for. She's

546
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:28,405
Speaker 2:  definitely my favorite player to root for. There are a few other folks who

547
00:35:28,405 --> 00:35:32,365
Speaker 2:  pop up in these videos a lot. There's Eddie and Wolf and Matthew who

548
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:35,685
Speaker 2:  was the one in that very first video and now also helps the sneaky with some

549
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:39,445
Speaker 2:  of the behind the scenes process and If, you watch long enough you can

550
00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:43,525
Speaker 2:  actually see in the comments people picking their favorites and each player

551
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:47,765
Speaker 2:  actually developing their own character in the series like Eddie I love

552
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:51,365
Speaker 2:  Eddie. Eddie always starts great and always just collapses at the end. Wolf

553
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:55,365
Speaker 2:  is super up and down. Bella is just a quiet killer in the

554
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:59,325
Speaker 2:  best way. These people are now part of the twin tour golf universe

555
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:03,405
Speaker 2:  in a way that is I think increasingly strategic and it

556
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:07,325
Speaker 2:  is designed to make sure that this thing can last. Making that thing last

557
00:36:07,385 --> 00:36:10,765
Speaker 2:  by the way is the whole game now. More on that coming right after this break.

558
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:11,645
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

559
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:20,165
Speaker 4:  Support For. this episode comes From, A-W-S-A-W-S.

Speaker 4:  Generative AI gives you the tools to power your business forward with the

Speaker 4:  security and speed of the world's most experienced cloud.

562
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:34,525
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So. You can pretty easily imagine how a bunch of mini

563
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,445
Speaker 2:  golf videos would get boring over time, right? Same guys, same course

564
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:42,365
Speaker 2:  over and over. It eventually just gets old and repetitive. There's a reason

565
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:45,925
Speaker 2:  you see creators of almost any kind start to do wild challenges

566
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:06,275
Speaker 6:  one for third, and then we pile up all the player

567
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:09,275
Speaker 6:  of the year points for the whole year,

568
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:13,915
Speaker 6:  which runs From September to September.

569
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:17,955
Speaker 6:  Now So we're through one year. Danny was player of the year in year

570
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:20,195
Speaker 6:  one he had the most points and then

571
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,715
Speaker 2:  It feels like cheating. Give yourself player of the year, I don't I, don't

572
00:38:22,715 --> 00:38:22,795
Speaker 2:  know,

573
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:27,115
Speaker 6:  But now it all reset and we just are in our first season

574
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:28,235
Speaker 6:  of the new year.

575
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:32,795
Speaker 2:  There's a really delicate content balance in There. They're trying

576
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:36,525
Speaker 2:  to both keep viewers hooked and make them wanna watch the next one, but also

577
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:40,165
Speaker 2:  to get new viewers interested on TikTok in particular. You're not gonna land

578
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:44,045
Speaker 2:  on the first one of these, you're just gonna find a random three holes

579
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:47,445
Speaker 2:  of a random tournament and that has to be captivating too.

580
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:51,245
Speaker 2:  So for the twin tour guys, the whole system resets every month and they're

581
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:55,125
Speaker 2:  always looking to add new players to freshen things up, but There is still

582
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,965
Speaker 2:  that big annual payoff, which genuinely does feel like a real

583
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:03,045
Speaker 2:  capstone if you've been watching all their videos all year. The

584
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:06,005
Speaker 2:  guys didn't wanna tell me exactly how much money they're making From all

585
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:09,045
Speaker 2:  the stuff they're posting now except to say that it is working as their full-time

586
00:39:09,065 --> 00:39:13,045
Speaker 2:  job. Most of the money that they're making comes From monetizing

587
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:16,845
Speaker 2:  directly on the platforms. That means ad splits on YouTube, creator funds

588
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:20,685
Speaker 2:  on TikTok, that sort of thing. That works to a point, but as you get

589
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:24,525
Speaker 2:  bigger and I think, especially as you realize how finicky those platforms

590
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:28,445
Speaker 2:  can be and how dangerous it can be to depend on them for your entire livelihood,

591
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:33,005
Speaker 2:  everybody ends up wanting to diversify So far. One

592
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:36,365
Speaker 2:  of the coolest things that I've seen From, the twin tour golf guys, is that

593
00:39:36,365 --> 00:39:39,765
Speaker 2:  they found one very clever way to bring some new money in.

594
00:39:40,115 --> 00:39:43,925
Speaker 2:  They started asking people to Venmo them money to contribute to a prize for

595
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:44,685
Speaker 2:  each tournament winner.

596
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:48,445
Speaker 6:  It kind of, it happened last winter.

597
00:39:49,145 --> 00:39:52,605
Speaker 6:  We were traveling a lot and it was getting

598
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:56,445
Speaker 6:  expensive and it was kind of a thought that

599
00:39:56,755 --> 00:40:00,565
Speaker 6:  came by. If we do a full season, we're putting in hard work

600
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:05,085
Speaker 6:  and If you win and if you're a viewer and you enjoy the content,

601
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:08,965
Speaker 6:  maybe you've watched the entire season So far, you're like, wow, thanks

602
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:12,845
Speaker 6:  for the entertainment I, appreciate you guys. You guys helped me on

603
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:16,605
Speaker 6:  my lunch break, you guys get me through my day. Whatever it is they

604
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,725
Speaker 6:  send some money in and it kind of gives us something to play for but also

605
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:24,605
Speaker 6:  rewards those that play well and helps cover costs of

606
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:28,565
Speaker 6:  travel for these people that come with us and whatnot.

607
00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:32,925
Speaker 6:  So, it's really kind of just a tip, like a thank you for the entertainment

608
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:37,525
Speaker 6:  and then it also helps, it does on our end. It puts a

609
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:41,445
Speaker 6:  lot of pressure on it knowing, hey, I'm playing for

610
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:46,165
Speaker 6:  this and if I play well, it's mine. Or if

611
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:48,925
Speaker 6:  I don't play well, it's kind of gonna hurt.

612
00:40:49,195 --> 00:40:52,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's kind of a lot of money for a round of mini golf in in some of

613
00:40:52,365 --> 00:40:52,725
Speaker 2:  these. Yeah.

614
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:56,805
Speaker 6:  Oh it's pretty cool and kind of wanted it to make it feel like a true

615
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,965
Speaker 6:  tour, like the PGA tour, they have all the money for the players

616
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:04,645
Speaker 6:  So kind of just making it a tour feel and

617
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,925
Speaker 6:  competitive and something's on the line.

618
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:11,235
Speaker 2:  It's a good way to get the players paid and since Danny and Steven win a

619
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,995
Speaker 2:  lot, it gets them paid too, but it also feels different than them

620
00:41:14,995 --> 00:41:18,755
Speaker 2:  just being like pay $5 a month to access all of our content. It makes

621
00:41:18,755 --> 00:41:22,595
Speaker 2:  fans feel involved like they're sponsors of the event and it makes them feel

622
00:41:22,595 --> 00:41:26,515
Speaker 2:  like they're directly contributing to the game itself and not just to some

623
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:30,835
Speaker 2:  business entity somewhere. So far, it's not a lot of money. I've

624
00:41:30,835 --> 00:41:34,725
Speaker 2:  seen the purse So far as high as like 1700 bucks, which is not

625
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:38,125
Speaker 2:  pro athlete money, but to be fair is kind of a lot to win for a round of

626
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:41,765
Speaker 2:  mini golf. The fan tournaments and the Venmos will help, but

627
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:45,845
Speaker 2:  ultimately the twin tour guys do want to do the typical brand deals, but

628
00:41:45,845 --> 00:41:49,805
Speaker 2:  those are easier to do in regular golf than in mini golf. Like

629
00:41:50,095 --> 00:41:53,765
Speaker 2:  every golf creator eventually gets sponsored by a big golf brand.

630
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:57,605
Speaker 2:  There's a whole path There, but I'm not sure who the big name in mini

631
00:41:57,605 --> 00:42:01,525
Speaker 2:  golf is. You know? Plus at some point every sufficiently big

632
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:05,485
Speaker 2:  creator becomes a product person. You put your name on a makeup line or

633
00:42:05,485 --> 00:42:09,085
Speaker 2:  an energy drink or a weird Lunchable competitor or gadget

634
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:12,925
Speaker 2:  accessories or your own golf bag. I'm not sure What that thing is here,

635
00:42:13,145 --> 00:42:16,965
Speaker 2:  but I do have some ideas. Is the next step like the the

636
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,805
Speaker 2:  twin tour mini golf putter.

637
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:20,845
Speaker 6:  That would be pretty cool.

638
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:26,485
Speaker 6:  I I feel like a lot of people If, you go mini golfing,

639
00:42:26,485 --> 00:42:30,325
Speaker 6:  you're just using the putters, There, So, maybe a custom

640
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:33,165
Speaker 6:  putter for people, but We haven't really thought much about it yet.

641
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,645
Speaker 2:  Would you ever, would you wanna design a course?

642
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:40,325
Speaker 6:  We have talked about that and Big putts, the course

643
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:43,685
Speaker 6:  that we play has talked about opening up another

644
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:48,365
Speaker 6:  location, So potentially partnering with them

645
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:52,245
Speaker 6:  and they've given us freedom to design

646
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:56,205
Speaker 6:  holes and From all the courses we've played. Figure out What

647
00:42:56,205 --> 00:43:00,155
Speaker 6:  We, like What Hole. We would wanna see There, but

648
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:03,875
Speaker 6:  it would be a fun thing to set up our own mini golf course someday

649
00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:07,995
Speaker 6:  and have it somewhere we can film content whenever

650
00:43:08,215 --> 00:43:12,075
Speaker 6:  and not just filming content but promoting our own business, our own course,

651
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,995
Speaker 6:  So. It's definitely something we've been thinking about and maybe someday

652
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,675
Speaker 6:  we will do

653
00:43:16,945 --> 00:43:20,795
Speaker 2:  What is, What is the like ideal hole for great

654
00:43:20,795 --> 00:43:24,035
Speaker 2:  content. Mini golf as far as you guys are concerned, like What does it need

655
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:25,115
Speaker 2:  What has to happen.

656
00:43:26,075 --> 00:43:30,035
Speaker 6:  I think for performance on social media. I think something that kind of

657
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:33,835
Speaker 6:  takes some time to get down to the hole while also having

658
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:37,915
Speaker 6:  a smooth green So. Something that kind of takes maybe about

659
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,835
Speaker 6:  eight seconds to see whether or not it's gonna be online. If it has

660
00:43:41,915 --> 00:43:45,475
Speaker 6:  a chance to go in for a hole in one So a little longer

661
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:49,515
Speaker 6:  hole with the suspense, you have five to

662
00:43:49,515 --> 00:43:53,475
Speaker 6:  eight seconds of like, oh this could go in, this might not go in, you still

663
00:43:53,475 --> 00:43:57,395
Speaker 6:  don't know. And then you see it miss or go in the hole. So.

664
00:43:58,515 --> 00:44:02,275
Speaker 6:  I, just like the holes that are typically a little bit longer and

665
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:06,155
Speaker 6:  courses that have a little quicker greens I feel tend

666
00:44:06,155 --> 00:44:06,955
Speaker 6:  to perform well.

667
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:11,195
Speaker 2:  That's interesting. I thought you were gonna say like cool looking obstacles

668
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:14,435
Speaker 2:  and weird stuff that's hard for people to figure out, but the time actually

669
00:44:14,435 --> 00:44:16,795
Speaker 2:  makes sense and there's the I, forget where it was, but there's the one course

670
00:44:16,795 --> 00:44:18,995
Speaker 2:  you guys have played a bunch of times where it has like the three-tiered

671
00:44:18,995 --> 00:44:22,795
Speaker 2:  green I feel like that's like exactly What you're talking about. Like it

672
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:26,155
Speaker 2:  takes forever to figure out if they hit a good shot or not in a way that

673
00:44:26,155 --> 00:44:27,475
Speaker 2:  is actually pretty compelling.

674
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:31,925
Speaker 6:  Yes, and we've noticed with like obstacles, if

675
00:44:31,925 --> 00:44:35,685
Speaker 6:  there's a windmill in the middle of the hole, it it's just

676
00:44:36,235 --> 00:44:40,125
Speaker 6:  kind of hard to record because it goes through, it disappears

677
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:43,525
Speaker 6:  for a little bit and then comes back out. So

678
00:44:44,155 --> 00:44:45,605
Speaker 6:  kind of when they have those

679
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:51,085
Speaker 6:  interesting designs on a hole where it's just like a straight

680
00:44:51,115 --> 00:44:54,965
Speaker 6:  hole with an obstacle in the middle, they just don't tend to perform

681
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,845
Speaker 6:  as well as a clear hole with some slope on it

682
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:00,965
Speaker 6:  and the ball heading towards the hole.

683
00:45:01,795 --> 00:45:05,045
Speaker 2:  I've been watching the twin tour mini golf stuff for almost as long as the

684
00:45:05,155 --> 00:45:09,085
Speaker 2:  Syne have been making it and I really do love watching strangers play

685
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:12,725
Speaker 2:  mini golf Way more than I expected and frankly I'm psyched to know I'm not

686
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:16,685
Speaker 2:  the only one, but I've also really enjoyed over the course of the last year

687
00:45:16,745 --> 00:45:20,205
Speaker 2:  seeing the twin tour golf guys go through kind of the whole

688
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:24,245
Speaker 2:  creator journey, one video and three holes at a time. The

689
00:45:24,245 --> 00:45:28,005
Speaker 2:  videos get a little more polished, they never too polished. There are more

690
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:31,125
Speaker 2:  hashtags. Over time the graphics get better. Promotional merch starts to

691
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:34,645
Speaker 2:  appear. They're now tagging the courses in the description and actually both

692
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:38,325
Speaker 2:  Syne say that they're starting to drive new people to courses all over the

693
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:41,605
Speaker 2:  place. There are new players that show up and then those players get their

694
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:45,165
Speaker 2:  own tiktoks and their own branches of the story. They're starting to push

695
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:48,525
Speaker 2:  people to YouTube because I think YouTube is just the most stable of these

696
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:52,605
Speaker 2:  platforms for a lot of reasons. But one thing I really like is that the

697
00:45:52,605 --> 00:45:55,805
Speaker 2:  videos, the videos are still pretty much the same.

698
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:58,285
Speaker 2:  Here's What, it sounded like a year ago,

699
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:02,605
Speaker 5:  I shot to tie Steven on one, rolled it in,

700
00:46:04,715 --> 00:46:08,645
Speaker 5:  Matthew, here's still some work left. Got it all tied through one

701
00:46:09,585 --> 00:46:13,245
Speaker 2:  And here's What. It sounds like now at the most recent tournament, the same

702
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:17,005
Speaker 2:  first hole almost exactly a year after that first video, Eddie

703
00:46:17,345 --> 00:46:20,445
Speaker 5:  Number one spot in the player of the year standing

704
00:46:20,985 --> 00:46:24,325
Speaker 5:  trying to keep it that way. Gonna tap it in for his two.

705
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:28,685
Speaker 5:  Steven Infer two. Matthew, thank you to everyone

706
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,045
Speaker 5:  that's contributed to this. Major's Purse

707
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:36,205
Speaker 5:  means a lot to us, a lot on the line. My pot got it for

708
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:40,125
Speaker 5:  my two and Bella for all twos on the first hole rolls

709
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:43,125
Speaker 5:  it in, all tied through one on,

710
00:46:43,665 --> 00:46:47,565
Speaker 2:  You know, What I love about that. If anything, it sounds worse. But in general

711
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:51,125
Speaker 2:  for all of the changes that they're making around these videos. The point

712
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:54,525
Speaker 2:  is they're not messing with What made this video work the first time,

713
00:46:54,835 --> 00:46:58,405
Speaker 2:  even down to things as simple as the music. You may have noticed it's the

714
00:46:58,435 --> 00:47:02,365
Speaker 2:  same song. It is the same song just about every time. It's

715
00:47:02,365 --> 00:47:06,085
Speaker 2:  literally a track called Epic Music, which is hilarious. It's been used

716
00:47:06,205 --> 00:47:10,045
Speaker 2:  158,000 times on TikTok and a lot of them are

717
00:47:10,045 --> 00:47:13,645
Speaker 2:  golf clips. I'm pretty sure you can blame the twin tour guys for that.

718
00:47:14,145 --> 00:47:18,085
Speaker 2:  At some point though, I do wonder how long this one thing can

719
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,765
Speaker 2:  keep going. There's not a ton of other mini golf content out There

720
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:25,165
Speaker 2:  right now. Both Danny and Steven actually said they're surprised they don't

721
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:28,725
Speaker 2:  have more competition, especially given how much golf content There is on

722
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:31,845
Speaker 2:  the internet, but There will be competitors eventually, especially if I'm

723
00:47:31,845 --> 00:47:35,245
Speaker 2:  right that it is like the perfect internet spectator sport and maybe

724
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:39,205
Speaker 2:  tiktoks algorithm will like those better. Maybe tiktoks algorithm won't always

725
00:47:39,205 --> 00:47:42,845
Speaker 2:  like mini golf. Will TikTok even be around long enough for us to find out

726
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:46,445
Speaker 2:  this is What I mean, this stuff is fragile. I don't know the answers to those

727
00:47:46,685 --> 00:47:50,365
Speaker 2:  questions and neither do the Sinis, which is the thing that struck me the

728
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:54,205
Speaker 2:  most actually about What they're doing. They don't really seem to be super

729
00:47:54,315 --> 00:47:57,725
Speaker 2:  tied to the idea that they are like mini golf content guys.

730
00:47:58,235 --> 00:48:01,685
Speaker 2:  They're really invested in doing this as long as it works, but I got the

731
00:48:01,685 --> 00:48:05,325
Speaker 2:  sense over and over that this is all just an excuse to play golf with their

732
00:48:05,485 --> 00:48:09,405
Speaker 2:  friends and honestly, I kind of love that. We talk a lot on this show

733
00:48:09,425 --> 00:48:12,885
Speaker 2:  and everywhere about the biggest creators on the internet, the ones starting

734
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:16,285
Speaker 2:  giant production companies and hiring tons of people and making millions

735
00:48:16,285 --> 00:48:20,005
Speaker 2:  of dollars and becoming a-list celebrities, but the Twin Tour guys seem to

736
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:23,845
Speaker 2:  be happy just being a small business, like a lifestyle business instead of

737
00:48:23,845 --> 00:48:27,165
Speaker 2:  a unicorn startup. They're playing a sport they like, they're hanging with

738
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:30,245
Speaker 2:  their friends and they're paying the bills in the process. They have some

739
00:48:30,245 --> 00:48:33,925
Speaker 2:  plans to grow and expand and do more stuff, but maybe that's enough.

740
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:38,325
Speaker 2:  The one thing I do wonder is if turning golf into content is making them

741
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:41,325
Speaker 2:  worse golfers, and it turns out Steven wonders about that too.

742
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:46,085
Speaker 6:  The other day we went out and golfed and played really well and then

743
00:48:46,085 --> 00:48:48,925
Speaker 6:  yesterday We went and played and recorded and

744
00:48:50,145 --> 00:48:53,845
Speaker 6:  we didn't do too well compared to the time when we weren't recording.

745
00:48:54,505 --> 00:48:57,485
Speaker 2:  But then he thought about it and he said he figured it's probably okay. Mr.

746
00:48:57,485 --> 00:48:58,805
Speaker 2:  Stupid putts is pretty good content.

747
00:49:00,555 --> 00:49:03,525
