00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,420
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of low latency head tracking.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,770
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am currently sitting in my car

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,400
Speaker 2:  futzing with its settings because apparently that's a thing you have to do.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,120
Speaker 2:  Now, I've never owned a new car before and then we bought a cool new

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,000
Speaker 2:  Hyundai Tucson hybrid, which I like a lot, but it makes all these

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,920
Speaker 2:  dumb noises and it beeps at me every time I forget to use the turn

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,850
Speaker 2:  signal or just open the door and it's halt just a lot.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,760
Speaker 2:  So I'm doing what any good tech geek does. I'm ignoring the manual entirely

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,350
Speaker 2:  and I'm just sitting here hitting all the buttons and seeing what happens.

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,040
Speaker 2:  Wish me luck. We have a great show today, all on a single

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,400
Speaker 2:  subject, well, a few subjects, virtual reality,

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,200
Speaker 2:  augmented reality, mixed reality, whatever you wanna call it, the

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,920
Speaker 2:  future of reality. The reason we're publishing this episode a day early is

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,720
Speaker 2:  because today is Meta Connect. And Meta is releasing both a new Quest

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,560
Speaker 2:  Pro headset and a lot of information about its plan for the future of

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,480
Speaker 2:  all this technology. We're gonna dig into the games, the headsets, and

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,000
Speaker 2:  everything else it'll take to make VR and AR and mixed reality

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,880
Speaker 2:  work if in fact it's ever going to. All that's coming

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,680
Speaker 2:  in just a sec. But first I have to apparently go put electrical tape

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,560
Speaker 2:  on the speaker in front of my car because that's the only way to make

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,080
Speaker 2:  the reverse noise quieter. I mean, listen to this, it's

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,590
Speaker 2:  awful.

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,280
Speaker 2:  This is the Vergecast. See you in a

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,890
Speaker 2:  sec.

26
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,430
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So the first thing I wanna do today is play a chunk of

27
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,390
Speaker 2:  an interview that the vers Alex Heath did with meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last

28
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,630
Speaker 2:  week ahead of Meta Connect. They had a long conversation about a lot of things.

29
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,630
Speaker 2:  Turns out there's a lot going on at Meta and if you wanna hear the whole

30
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,510
Speaker 2:  thing, it's available both on the Verges YouTube feed and on the decoder

31
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,630
Speaker 2:  podcast feed. But for our purposes, I just want you to hear the chunk of

32
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,310
Speaker 2:  their conversation about virtual reality and mixed reality and augmented

33
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,960
Speaker 2:  reality and the new Quest Pro headset and all of that good stuff. Although

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,370
Speaker 2:  Alex is sitting here with me right now. Hi Alex.

35
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,140
Speaker 4:  Hi David.

36
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,000
Speaker 2:  Tee this up for us. You've been spending a lot of time with Meow

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,160
Speaker 2:  people, including Mark Zuckerberg over the last couple of weeks. Like the

38
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,640
Speaker 2:  setting for this is obviously it's me connect, they have a lot of stuff to

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,390
Speaker 2:  announce, but like just tell us what you've been up to.

40
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah, so I've been traveling around a little bit. This started with an

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,560
Speaker 4:  invite to go up to their research center where they

42
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,360
Speaker 4:  build all of this future VR and AR stuff in the research

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,200
Speaker 4:  phase in Redmond outside of Seattle. And we did a bunch of research demos,

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,480
Speaker 4:  but we were mainly there to see this new headset that

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,080
Speaker 4:  Zuckerberg has been teasing in drips and drabs on his

46
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,000
Speaker 4:  Instagram for the last year, really called the Quest Pro. They've

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,420
Speaker 4:  been calling it Project Cambria leading up to this.

48
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,870
Speaker 2:  And you've been reporting on this for like a long time.

49
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah, this has been a long time coming and the idea with

50
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,320
Speaker 4:  the Quest Pro is that it, it's obviously more expensive. It's

51
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,280
Speaker 4:  1499, which is dramatically more than the current quest. It

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,160
Speaker 4:  introduces two big things that I think are meaningful on the kind of

53
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,010
Speaker 4:  just timeline of these headsets, right? Which is mixed reality.

54
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,760
Speaker 4:  So this concept of blending the real world with the virtual,

55
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,720
Speaker 4:  using pass through video and face tracking and eye tracking, which

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,440
Speaker 4:  really lets your avatars become a lot more lifelike and feel like

57
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,210
Speaker 4:  you're actually talking to people and not just, you know, basically

58
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,080
Speaker 4:  3D sims from the nineties like it has been. So that was the main

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,750
Speaker 4:  reason we were there. Tried a bunch of demos and then the week after that

60
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,410
Speaker 4:  I went back to San Francisco to met his headquarters

61
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,280
Speaker 4:  to sit down with Zuckerberg. He wanted to chat about the Quest Pro and

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,920
Speaker 4:  about everything they're working on, the rebrand, how it went, the metaverse,

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,800
Speaker 4:  why he basically feeds off of his doubters, which

64
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,760
Speaker 4:  I thought was interesting. And then we also talked about social media, how

65
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,480
Speaker 4:  they're competing with TikTok, his thoughts on what the government should

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Speaker 4:  do about TikTok, all that stuff. So it was, it was, you're right, it was

67
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,780
Speaker 4:  a long conversation, but a lot of it is talking about this new hardware.

68
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,620
Speaker 4:  And I would say this second biggest thing that they're announcing is this

69
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,600
Speaker 4:  big sweeping partnership with Microsoft on the

70
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,520
Speaker 4:  software and services side for vr to integrate basically all of Microsoft's

71
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,200
Speaker 4:  enterprise technology and even Windows itself into the Quest,

72
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,680
Speaker 4:  which is a pretty big deal hashed out between Zuckerberg and Sat

73
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,450
Speaker 4:  Nadella. So there's a lot to talk about. Mark was gracious with his time.

74
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,560
Speaker 4:  We didn't get to everything, but you know, I hope it's an interesting conversation

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:20,910
Speaker 4:  for people.

76
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,880
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it was a good one. And I, I agree that the window stuff is fascinating.

77
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,640
Speaker 2:  So we're, we're gonna get back to some of that and a little bit, but that

78
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,560
Speaker 2:  is enough wind up. Let's just get to it. Here is Alex and Mark

79
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,190
Speaker 2:  Zuckerberg.

80
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,880
Speaker 4:  Well let's talk about the Quest Pro, cause I got got to try it at your research

81
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,740
Speaker 4:  center in Redmond recently and it's very different from

82
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,280
Speaker 4:  the existing Quest line. And I think there's two big things that

83
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,080
Speaker 4:  people will have probably not experienced until they try it. It'll be the

84
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,520
Speaker 4:  first time they try it and see this is the face tracking and mixed

85
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,480
Speaker 4:  reality. And I wanted to kind of talk about those two points with

86
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,170
Speaker 4:  you. Maybe starting with mixed reality, which is this isn't

87
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,120
Speaker 4:  VR in the traditional sense, you're actually mixing video of the world around

88
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Speaker 4:  you with vr. Yeah. Why is this something that needs to exist?

89
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,920
Speaker 4:  I mean, what, what does mixed reality represent on the continuum of like

90
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,080
Speaker 4:  where you've gone with VR today? Just

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,700
Speaker 6:  First for for background, you know, mixed reality. What it basically is that

92
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,410
Speaker 6:  you see the physical world around you and then you can overlay digital

93
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,050
Speaker 6:  objects. So you can think about virtual reality

94
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,840
Speaker 6:  is the system is basically painting every pixel, right? So you're in a fully

95
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,360
Speaker 6:  immersive world, you're, you're in a completely different place over the

96
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,720
Speaker 6:  long term. You'll have augmented reality, which are, you know, glasses, something

97
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,480
Speaker 6:  like what you're wearing now is basically like the target of what we would

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,080
Speaker 6:  like to get to. I don't know if you'll be able to get that much smaller than

99
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,560
Speaker 6:  that cuz there's a lot of, a lot of electronics to cram in there. Yeah, right.

100
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,240
Speaker 6:  The, you know, all the silicon and the projector and the wave

101
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,680
Speaker 6:  guides to display the holograms and the cameras to basically make sure that

102
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,320
Speaker 6:  all the objects and the holograms are locked in the right place in the world

103
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,200
Speaker 6:  and the speakers and batteries, right? So, so a lot of stuff to

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,360
Speaker 6:  fit into those glasses. But you'll get that and when you have glasses like

105
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,330
Speaker 6:  what you're wearing now, you'll see the kind of actual

106
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,880
Speaker 6:  photons from the world, things around you and then you'll overlay holograms

107
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,680
Speaker 6:  just in that place. So mixed reality is sort of this in between where it's

108
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,520
Speaker 6:  a VR device that basically every kind of pixel

109
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,240
Speaker 6:  that you're seeing in your, in your vision is rendered by, by the

110
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,160
Speaker 6:  graphics pipeline in the device. But it does this thing

111
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,490
Speaker 6:  called pass through where you have cameras on the outside an array of cameras

112
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,640
Speaker 6:  because you know your eyes, you we see in stereo, right? That's how we get

113
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,000
Speaker 6:  3d. So it's not just one camera. It's important that we get the different

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,770
Speaker 6:  perspectives and it can basically pass that through

115
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,600
Speaker 6:  in high resolution and in color. And then

116
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Speaker 6:  given the screen, it can either print what the photons are that it's getting

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,480
Speaker 6:  from the outside or they can overlay digital objects.

118
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,880
Speaker 6:  So you can be sitting at a, at a desk and have your kind of perfect workstation

119
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,640
Speaker 6:  up with three huge monitors and, but you can see your physical keyboard

120
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,040
Speaker 6:  in front of you and your physical mouse so you can control your, the digital

121
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,390
Speaker 6:  monitors that aren't actually there.

122
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,760
Speaker 4:  I tried this, I tried this last week and I will say the monitor thing is

123
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,640
Speaker 4:  compelling. What I noticed was the keyboard itself was a little fuzzy

124
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,520
Speaker 4:  still, and I didn't feel like I could see the keys super well to

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,750
Speaker 4:  feel like confident typing.

126
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,290
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean I think that all the stuff will get better over time.

127
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,000
Speaker 6:  There's some kind of tracking augmentation that we can do for

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,360
Speaker 6:  certain keyboards too. Sears may just not have had that, but in general you

129
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,600
Speaker 6:  can get a sense of where, where this is going. Right? And I don't think,

130
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,840
Speaker 6:  I mean this is a V1 device, right? So it's not the perfect

131
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,280
Speaker 6:  incarnation of this. I mean, just like Quest one de Quest two is this huge

132
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,920
Speaker 6:  jump and there's a, you know, many times more sales. I I I do think, you

133
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,200
Speaker 6:  know, it's like, well we'll keep on building this out, but, but I, this is

134
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,520
Speaker 6:  the best mixed reality that anyone has built right so far. And this is, yeah.

135
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,350
Speaker 6:  And this kind of, I think is enough to introduce the concept to the world

136
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,320
Speaker 6:  show where it's going, get the development ecosystem starting to go. So you'll,

137
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Speaker 6:  you're, you'll get people building use cases for, for work,

138
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,910
Speaker 6:  whether it's the, the desktop, you know, solo productivity example.

139
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,640
Speaker 6:  You'll be able to have kind of hybrid meetings where, you know, instead of

140
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,040
Speaker 6:  work rooms, which we have today where you're in VR and you can see people's

141
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,240
Speaker 6:  avatars now you'll be able to have hybrid meetings where you can see some

142
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,920
Speaker 6:  people can physically be there and you'll see them, but then other people

143
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,360
Speaker 6:  will just show up in VR and you'll see their avatars. So that'll be pretty

144
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Speaker 6:  sweet. So

145
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,400
Speaker 4:  There's a, I mean there's a lot of mixed reality use cases I think that will

146
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,640
Speaker 4:  show out over time. The other component of this is face tracking and being

147
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,610
Speaker 4:  able to see your face movements and your eye movements. And I see the value

148
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,320
Speaker 4:  in, in the experience. I, I did a demo where I was with one of your employees

149
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,600
Speaker 4:  in workroom and it, it felt, it did feel more visceral like being able to

150
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,480
Speaker 4:  see how our face reacted in real time. Yeah, yeah. So I understand the

151
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,680
Speaker 4:  use case of it completely. I'm curious how you thought about building that

152
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,000
Speaker 4:  into the product from a privacy perspective. Cuz obviously there's gonna

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,520
Speaker 4:  be concerns about face tracking. Yeah,

154
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,800
Speaker 6:  Sure, sure. I mean, first let's talk about like what it is and why it's valuable.

155
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,920
Speaker 6:  Sure. I mean, I think, well, I can answer your question quickly on the privacy

156
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,760
Speaker 6:  side. Yeah. The face sensing data stays on the device, right? And we don't

157
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,040
Speaker 6:  send the raw data to apps and people basically have to opt in if they want

158
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,200
Speaker 6:  the, an app to, to be able to know where, where they're looking, the eye

159
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,640
Speaker 6:  tracking or, or their face expression.

160
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,650
Speaker 4:  And importantly, you don't have the raw data either, like medical,

161
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,160
Speaker 6:  No, it's, it's on the device and, and it's, and it's encrypted and then it

162
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,640
Speaker 6:  basically gets thrown away as soon as it's processed. So, so I think that,

163
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,360
Speaker 6:  that, that's, so from a privacy perspective, I think we can Okay. I I actually

164
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,800
Speaker 6:  think that that's been,

165
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,790
Speaker 4:  You think that's solid?

166
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,960
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean we've also had people come and audited and, and you know, I'm

167
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,080
Speaker 6:  sure over time we'll we'll add more capabilities and we'll need to keep thinking

168
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,840
Speaker 6:  through this. So security is never a thing that's done. Sure. Right. But

169
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,600
Speaker 6:  it's, it's something that we've thought through very carefully given the,

170
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,320
Speaker 6:  the sensitivity around it. But I do think it's worth just talking about why

171
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,760
Speaker 6:  the, this is such a big deal, right? So mixed reality I think is clearly

172
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,520
Speaker 6:  a big deal because it's this bridge between virtual reality, which you can

173
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,440
Speaker 6:  build today an augmented reality, which you kinda want, but it's, it's still

174
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,680
Speaker 6:  a few years away from really being able to get built. So this, this sort

175
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,380
Speaker 6:  of starts to bring that experience and even if it's in a VR form factor,

176
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,320
Speaker 6:  the face expressions are critical because it gets to why we're

177
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,260
Speaker 6:  in this at all, which is we're really focused on

178
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,080
Speaker 6:  the potential of VR and AR to deliver

179
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,960
Speaker 6:  this authentic sense of presence. No other technology can do

180
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,630
Speaker 6:  this, right? It's like when you're on your phone or if you're on a Zoom call,

181
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,360
Speaker 6:  it's nice to be able to see the person, you can like pick up some context

182
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,200
Speaker 6:  around them, but you brain is under no illusion that you are

183
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,680
Speaker 6:  there with them, right? It's like you, you, if if anything you're trying

184
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,000
Speaker 6:  to convince yourself that you're kind of having a closer interaction, you

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,570
Speaker 6:  obviously know you're in a different room and all that, the, the magic of

186
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,360
Speaker 6:  VR for people who have experienced this, you know, that it just, it it

187
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,280
Speaker 6:  basically immediately convinces your mind that you are present

188
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,680
Speaker 6:  in another place and with the people who are there. And when you see

189
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,920
Speaker 6:  avatars, you know, even if they're expressive avatars that aren't yet photo

190
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,730
Speaker 6:  realistic, it, it feels very rich and present when you're there

191
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,600
Speaker 6:  in, in a lot of ways, you know, even more so than, you know, what you would

192
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,800
Speaker 6:  get on a zoom call today, where obviously people show up in a photo realistic

193
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,320
Speaker 6:  way, but there's, there's just so much that it doesn't feel like you're actually

194
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,830
Speaker 6:  present. Whereas even if you have this expressive, somewhat cartoon

195
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,600
Speaker 6:  avatar, you know, next to you, it, it actually, you know, you feel like you're

196
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Speaker 6:  there next to each other even if you're, you know, thousands of miles apart

197
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,440
Speaker 6:  if they're on the other coast or something like

198
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,930
Speaker 4:  That. And that to you is compelling in and of its own right for this technology

199
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,790
Speaker 4:  to where you think that's gonna be a reason people gravitate towards

200
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,560
Speaker 6:  That. To me that is the primary value of it is

201
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,440
Speaker 6:  basically the ability to feel and deliver this sense of

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,320
Speaker 6:  presence. I think this like human sense of presence is such

203
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,200
Speaker 6:  a profound and magical thing that, and we're a

204
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,080
Speaker 6:  company that just like everyone here wakes up in the morning and thinks about

205
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,040
Speaker 6:  how we're gonna like help people connect and communicate. You can't

206
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,240
Speaker 6:  deliver that kind of sense of presence on any of the platforms that we've

207
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,090
Speaker 6:  had the opportunity to build on yet, right? So we build on web, on pc,

208
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,000
Speaker 6:  on mobile, there's a lot of good things about all those platforms, but if

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,150
Speaker 6:  you think about like what is the ultimate expression of social technology,

210
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,640
Speaker 6:  you're not gonna get it on a phone, right? So that's why we're

211
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,120
Speaker 6:  investing so much money in, in like so many of our, our top

212
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,890
Speaker 6:  people in trying to invent and, and accelerate the development

213
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,520
Speaker 6:  of, of this next platform because it's gonna enable, I think the ultimate

214
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,280
Speaker 6:  expression of, of what we set out to do. Building, building social

215
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,400
Speaker 6:  software. So then the question is, okay, what are all the things that we

216
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,160
Speaker 6:  just need to like burn down to make it so that like on the list of things

217
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,840
Speaker 6:  that get in the way of feeling like you're even more immersed and present

218
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,440
Speaker 6:  with other people, one of them obviously is realistic expressions,

219
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,880
Speaker 6:  right? So, you know, I think that this is gonna be one of the defining characteristics

220
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,280
Speaker 6:  of, of this product and, and hopefully a lot more that we do going

221
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,200
Speaker 6:  forward, is the accurate kind of face

222
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,120
Speaker 6:  expressions and ability to make eye contact, which is also

223
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,880
Speaker 6:  really powerful and also something you can't really do on video calls today.

224
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,040
Speaker 6:  It's, it's kind of, yeah. You know, it's like if you try to look at someone's

225
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,360
Speaker 6:  eyes, you're not looking at the camera. Yeah. You know, so all these kinda

226
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,680
Speaker 6:  weird issues that break the sense of presence. Yeah. But in order to do that,

227
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,560
Speaker 6:  it's a pretty big trade off in the design because you putting a bunch of

228
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,120
Speaker 6:  different sensors in there. Yeah. Which consume a lot of

229
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,720
Speaker 6:  the CPU on the device and, and the, the kind of silicon

230
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,640
Speaker 6:  power budget that you have basically processing the input from

231
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,480
Speaker 6:  these sensors in order to make it so that when you're in VR and

232
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,400
Speaker 6:  mixed reality and eventually augmented reality, your representation of yourself

233
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,800
Speaker 6:  will have realistic expressions. So I'm interested to see what happens, but

234
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,360
Speaker 6:  I think other folks in the space and you look at like, Sony's coming out

235
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,640
Speaker 6:  with a new headset this year. I mean this isn't like a thing that I think

236
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,470
Speaker 6:  that they're prioritizing.

237
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,040
Speaker 4:  I think Apple's headset is gonna look and work a lot like this actually.

238
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,400
Speaker 6:  Well, we'll see. Yeah. I mean it's, I dunno, it's, it's actually, it's been

239
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,800
Speaker 6:  very hard for us to have any sense of what they're doing. So I, I find it

240
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,350
Speaker 6:  best to just,

241
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,000
Speaker 4:  I think we'll know soon. Well, we'll yeah,

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,280
Speaker 6:  That'll be interesting too. Yeah. But it's something that this really gets

243
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,960
Speaker 6:  to the mission of what we're, of what we're

244
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Speaker 4:  Doing in terms of tradeoffs too. This is an expensive device. This is a lot

245
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,640
Speaker 4:  more expensive than the Quest two. Yeah. You've been very clear that you

246
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,360
Speaker 4:  want to make these devices as cheap as possible to get them in the hands

247
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,520
Speaker 4:  of as many people as possible. Yes. I think in, in 2017 you said you want

248
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,350
Speaker 4:  a billion people in vr, that was your goal. Well, it's a good start.

249
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,927
Speaker 4:  I think the, I think the Quest two has done over 10 million

250
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,160
Speaker 4:  sales to date. Does that sound accurate to

251
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,640
Speaker 6:  You? I mean, I'm not, don't estimates we haven't shared any numbers. Why

252
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,400
Speaker 6:  not? Why not? That's a good question. I I think we tend to

253
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,050
Speaker 6:  not share numbers until things are a lot bigger, but a lot.

254
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,430
Speaker 4:  So you're waiting for a certain number.

255
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,380
Speaker 6:  I, I don't actually have a number in mind, but, but I,

256
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,160
Speaker 4:  I'm not sure

257
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,720
Speaker 6:  That, yeah, I'm not sure that there's

258
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,560
Speaker 4:  Any particular, So the estimates are that you've done over 10 million with

259
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,740
Speaker 4:  Quest, I'm sure it's higher than that. You're obviously far from a billion.

260
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,680
Speaker 4:  But who is this device for at this price point? Because I think, you

261
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,640
Speaker 4:  know, the Quest two is considered kind of a gaming device. There's a lot

262
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,520
Speaker 4:  of social stuff starting to happen. There's fitness with Supernatural, who

263
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,250
Speaker 4:  is the target customer for this?

264
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,240
Speaker 6:  So there, there are really two sets of folks. One are just people who

265
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,000
Speaker 6:  want the best VR device that anyone has made. So I, I think if you want

266
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,550
Speaker 6:  that, this is it, it is better than the Quest two.

267
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,680
Speaker 6:  It's a lot more expensive so it won't be for everyone, but there is some

268
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,280
Speaker 6:  group of people who want that. The second is people who

269
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,120
Speaker 6:  want basically a device that's for productivity. When I think about

270
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,840
Speaker 6:  the market, I think that there are gonna be two basic different kind of tiers

271
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,160
Speaker 6:  and price segments. I think there's gonna be a, a kind of consumer oriented

272
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,120
Speaker 6:  segment that is, you know, maybe three, four, $500

273
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,000
Speaker 6:  devices that people widely can, can afford sort of in the

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,840
Speaker 6:  price of an Xbox or a PlayStation. A lot of the use cases there will be entertainment

275
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,520
Speaker 6:  focused, whether it's gaming or social and, and kind of hanging out with

276
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,240
Speaker 6:  people or things like fitness and that that list of use cases

277
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,960
Speaker 6:  will just continue growing. But it's, it's been pretty cool to see, see how

278
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,080
Speaker 6:  that's expanded so far. If you think about how you use computers, there's

279
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,980
Speaker 6:  also clearly a market for people who want to pay,

280
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,750
Speaker 6:  you know, are willing to pay $1,500, $2,000

281
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,270
Speaker 6:  kind of high end professionals for their workstations.

282
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,840
Speaker 4:  That's what you imagine being the alliance for

283
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,440
Speaker 6:  This. Yeah, I mean for this and for the future of the pro line

284
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,600
Speaker 6:  overall, right. I do think that there's going to be a market for people who

285
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,160
Speaker 6:  want to get, the people are really interested in VR being

286
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,990
Speaker 6:  able to be their primary workstation over time.

287
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,560
Speaker 6:  I think that that's, there's gonna be a market around that and people who

288
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,760
Speaker 6:  are sort of high-end professionals there, you're already paying thousands

289
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,840
Speaker 6:  of dollars for your workstation. So I think that's pretty clear that the

290
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Speaker 6:  ability to get more technology into there to make that even better.

291
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,200
Speaker 6:  You'd do it. Yeah. Right. If I could, if I could give all of our engineers

292
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,960
Speaker 6:  a device and have them, you know, be 3% more productive, I'd give them a

293
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,880
Speaker 6:  $1,500 device for for sure. So that's kind of the, the, in terms

294
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,680
Speaker 6:  of the market segmentation, what we expect to happen, there's

295
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,560
Speaker 6:  also this advantage in developing both of them, which is that we

296
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,200
Speaker 6:  can introduce new technology

297
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,680
Speaker 4:  First in this one, in this,

298
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Before we can get it into the price point for the consumer one. Right.

299
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,000
Speaker 6:  And being able to work on it and developing it actually helps us get it into

300
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,960
Speaker 6:  the consumer one faster and better. And by the

301
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,720
Speaker 6:  time that it is in the consumer one, we already have a developer ecosystem

302
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,560
Speaker 6:  and content around it because even if fewer people are buying the Quest one,

303
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,920
Speaker 6:  it's more of a high end device, it'll be enough to kinda get the developer

304
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,600
Speaker 6:  ecosystem going. So of course we're working on more devices in the consumer

305
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,400
Speaker 6:  line too, where there will be a Quest three at some point, not this

306
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,080
Speaker 6:  year, but, you know, I'd love to get, you know, some of these features into,

307
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,840
Speaker 6:  into future devices. Whether it's Quest three, Quest four, and you know,

308
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,760
Speaker 6:  the fact that we're building Quest Pro and have that and people can start

309
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,480
Speaker 6:  building for mixed reality and, and all that is, is I think it'll be just

310
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,640
Speaker 6:  a pretty big advantage on that too.

311
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,560
Speaker 4:  You've been pretty open that on the Quest too. You are not making money on

312
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,790
Speaker 4:  the hardware. Are you making money on this like on a unit basis or,

313
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,530
Speaker 6:  I, I mean I'd have to look there lots of different ways to basically

314
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,000
Speaker 6:  do the accounting on this as I've learned. So

315
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,760
Speaker 4:  Is this a profit generating

316
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,740
Speaker 6:  Device? No, I think the, the, the strategy overall is

317
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,720
Speaker 6:  not to make money on the hardware but to make it that it can help develop

318
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,560
Speaker 6:  the ecosystem and then over time the business model will be based on

319
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,480
Speaker 6:  software and services. So that, that remains the approach. I

320
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,680
Speaker 4:  Wasn't sure because I you invest so much in hardware, you have so many people

321
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,160
Speaker 4:  working on this, you're spending so much money on hardware. I wasn't sure

322
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,080
Speaker 4:  if you had landed on a hardware. That's, that's why I think business

323
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,770
Speaker 4:  or not,

324
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,720
Speaker 6:  It probably depends on how exactly you account

325
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,640
Speaker 6:  for it. So like if, if you're just saying what is like the materials

326
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,760
Speaker 6:  that go into the device, maybe we're charging a little bit more for that,

327
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,680
Speaker 6:  for, for the device than the materials that go into it. But if you account

328
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,520
Speaker 6:  for all the r and d and everything, then no way. But no, the, the

329
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,160
Speaker 6:  strategy is not, I mean we're not trying to have

330
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,900
Speaker 6:  premium device prices and make a profit on that.

331
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,770
Speaker 6:  Our whole approach as a company is get as many people as possible

332
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,200
Speaker 6:  to be able to access these tools and then over time you build a better

333
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Speaker 6:  ecosystem that way. Got it. And that, this is like a pretty deep part of

334
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,080
Speaker 6:  our philosophy around this overall. We also wanna help build the open

335
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,600
Speaker 6:  ecosystem around all of this. So rather than being kind of

336
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,480
Speaker 6:  insular and you know, trying to do everything ourselves and a

337
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,800
Speaker 6:  big part of the theme for this year's connect is all the partnerships that

338
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,720
Speaker 6:  we have for the, the partnership with Microsoft, which is gonna be fundamental

339
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,240
Speaker 6:  for you. We're not talk about, we're not enterprise company, right. So, so

340
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,080
Speaker 6:  making it that this can basically succeed with

341
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:01,270
Speaker 6:  enterprises

342
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,600
Speaker 2:  Like I mentioned before. You can hear the rest of that conversation between

343
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,480
Speaker 2:  Alex Heath and Mark Zuckerberg in the decoder podcast feed. Or you can watch

344
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,200
Speaker 2:  the whole thing on our YouTube channel, youtube.com/the Verge. We

345
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,240
Speaker 2:  need to take a break but Alex is gonna stick around and we're also gonna

346
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,040
Speaker 2:  grab add Robertson to come on and talk about the Quest Pro itself. We'll

347
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,240
Speaker 2:  be right

348
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:24,815
Speaker 2:  back.

349
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,700
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So we've heard a lot now about Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's,

350
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,340
Speaker 2:  big plans for like your legs and mixed reality and

351
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,220
Speaker 2:  the metaverse and how we're all just gonna bop around in the future.

352
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,860
Speaker 2:  But let's talk about the here and now, which is the Quest pro. Addie Robertson's

353
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,480
Speaker 2:  here. Hi Addie. Hi. And Alex is still here. Hi Alex.

354
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,340
Speaker 2:  Hey. And if I'm not mistaken, you now have both seen and used

355
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,380
Speaker 2:  the Quest Pro, correct? That's right.

356
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,300
Speaker 8:  That is correct.

357
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,100
Speaker 2:  Okay, so Addie, why don't you go first tell me like walk me through

358
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,860
Speaker 2:  this thing in context of like what quests have been like before. Tell me

359
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,900
Speaker 2:  about the Quest Pro.

360
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,740
Speaker 8:  Yeah, in some ways the Quest Pro is imagine everything about the quest. Imagine

361
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,570
Speaker 8:  a lot of the things you don't really like about the quest that's super front

362
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,060
Speaker 8:  heavy. It's default strap is really bad, it's screen

363
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,980
Speaker 8:  is decent but not the most absolutely high resolution. And

364
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,580
Speaker 8:  you can do this pass through ar but it's only black and white and it's

365
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,460
Speaker 8:  pretty rudimentary. So then just take that and upgrade all of

366
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,210
Speaker 8:  it and fix a lot of that. So it's lighter and

367
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,980
Speaker 8:  thinner. It's, it's not remotely at pair of glasses territory but it's a

368
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,140
Speaker 8:  lot less front heavy. They've done things like move the battery to the back.

369
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,020
Speaker 8:  It's got this high resolution screen that can do color pass through.

370
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,620
Speaker 8:  So you can do this kind of, it's not foe, it's pass through

371
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,380
Speaker 8:  AR that lets you see everything around you. It's got an

372
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,260
Speaker 8:  upgraded processor, it's so it's another snap drag and XR two

373
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,180
Speaker 8:  plus this time instead of XR two, you've got also eye tracking

374
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,900
Speaker 8:  in it, which means that it can do things like a foviated

375
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,860
Speaker 8:  rendering, which is if you're looking at a thing, you're pointing your eyes

376
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,580
Speaker 8:  at it, it renders the image really sharply. Otherwise if it's on

377
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,030
Speaker 8:  your peripheral vision it gets to be a little blurry. And so that saves processing

378
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,340
Speaker 8:  power. It also means that it can read your facial expressions. Mark Zuckerberg

379
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,040
Speaker 8:  made a really big deal out of this with Joe Rogan's podcast where

380
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,870
Speaker 8:  if you're in anything with an avatar, if you're in horizon worlds

381
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,720
Speaker 8:  or a different quote unquote metaverse service, it can mirror your

382
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,400
Speaker 8:  facial expressions, see if you are smiling, see when you're blinking

383
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,160
Speaker 8:  or winking. So it has a lot of those features. It also, I'm sure that we

384
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,750
Speaker 8:  will get into this a little. It's one really big downside is it

385
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,640
Speaker 8:  has, from what I can tell, having not experienced one long

386
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,440
Speaker 8:  consecutive session myself, very bad battery life, I'm told one to

387
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,360
Speaker 8:  two hours, which is compared to like two to three. And I think I've stretched

388
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,800
Speaker 8:  it maybe a little beyond that for the Quest two.

389
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,070
Speaker 4:  I think on the hardware front, like Addie was saying,

390
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,000
Speaker 4:  it's remarkably better than the quest too. And really anything

391
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,200
Speaker 4:  that I've tried, I think Addie's maybe tried some more headsets than I have,

392
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
Speaker 4:  but I haven't tried anything that has this level

393
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,080
Speaker 4:  of comfortability optics. I should note this is an important thing. If you

394
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,640
Speaker 4:  wear glasses like me, this thing is much easier to wear with glasses because

395
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,480
Speaker 4:  of just the way it's designed, which is a huge difference for me. I get

396
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,240
Speaker 4:  that like it's just, you know, still large, right?

397
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,600
Speaker 4:  And there's battery constraints, but you can see where it's going. There's

398
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,720
Speaker 4:  a huge question of who this is for, right? It

399
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,660
Speaker 4:  costs 1499 and at that price point you're

400
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,330
Speaker 4:  really not including that kind of

401
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,960
Speaker 4:  casual curious VR user that the Quest two is

402
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,400
Speaker 4:  really targeted at. So they're really making this a

403
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,240
Speaker 4:  concerted enterprise push. I mean we heard with Zuckerberg,

404
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,970
Speaker 4:  he thinks there's really two cohorts of people who will wanna buy

405
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,520
Speaker 4:  this VR diehards who are on the cutting edge and wanna try everything. I'm

406
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,080
Speaker 4:  not sure how many people there are that fit into that bucket, but I'm sure

407
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,960
Speaker 4:  they're out there. It's

408
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,680
Speaker 2:  Like the three of us and 12 other people I think is basically the, the entirety

409
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,080
Speaker 2:  of that

410
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,830
Speaker 4:  Audience there is honestly a budding developer economy here. So, you

411
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,600
Speaker 4:  know, I think that's the other key piece is the point of this is to really

412
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,240
Speaker 4:  kickstart a developer flywheel for mixed reality that can then be poured

413
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,910
Speaker 4:  into the more, you know, consumer cheaper quest lines and

414
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,440
Speaker 4:  future headsets and even air glasses down the road. And then, you

415
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,080
Speaker 4:  know, with the enterprise side, I think because of the price point they're

416
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,560
Speaker 4:  thinking can we just position this for businesses? And you've got that Microsoft

417
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,320
Speaker 4:  partnership that's really broad. It encompasses pretty much all of

418
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,210
Speaker 4:  Microsoft services and most importantly their sales

419
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,640
Speaker 4:  muscle in terms of getting it into businesses that use

420
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,600
Speaker 4:  Azure and Microsoft's device management stuff. So I think that could

421
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,160
Speaker 4:  turn out to be the wild card that if that partnership works, we could all

422
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,120
Speaker 4:  of a sudden see this headset really do well. But

423
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,410
Speaker 4:  if that doesn't work, I'm just really not sure who buys

424
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,200
Speaker 4:  this because with everything a mentioned in the battery life and all that,

425
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,760
Speaker 4:  it's just, it's kind of a tough sell. It's a very cool demo. Like I want

426
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,680
Speaker 4:  to be clear, like we did these, all these demos in it and I was

427
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,450
Speaker 4:  very impressed with the mixed reality and you know, just with the

428
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,040
Speaker 4:  comfortness of it and, and the the fidelity and the, and the face tracking,

429
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,920
Speaker 4:  you know like when you're, when you're looking at an avatar and their eyes

430
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,280
Speaker 4:  actually move and their face moves as they laugh, it's, it's a

431
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,240
Speaker 4:  strange experience. I think people will have kind of a, a bit of an

432
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,080
Speaker 4:  aha moment the first time they experience full face and eye tracking

433
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,920
Speaker 4:  in one of these, you know, virtual worlds. It really does just add a

434
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,080
Speaker 4:  new layer. Yeah, but it's still early. I mean this is, this thing is really

435
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,800
Speaker 4:  a nice piece of hardware and search of software that makes sense for

436
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,320
Speaker 2:  It. Totally. Yeah. The two things I'm, I'm most curious about just from like

437
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,160
Speaker 2:  a demo perspective and I wanna hear kind of the stuff you guys got to try

438
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,240
Speaker 2:  but is the pass through thing, which seems like obviously if we're on this

439
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,120
Speaker 2:  like long road to augmented reality, like making pass through that works

440
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,680
Speaker 2:  really well is really important. So I, I'm curious to hear like what you

441
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,840
Speaker 2:  guys have seen in terms of how that goes. So let's start there. Like what,

442
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,350
Speaker 2:  what did you guys get to try, How did the actual sort of

443
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,000
Speaker 2:  reality pass through camera stuff work?

444
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,520
Speaker 8:  Maybe growing with like two separate categories of demo. There were things

445
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,360
Speaker 8:  that were more or less pure tech demos. There's a face

446
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,840
Speaker 8:  tracking test where you're looking at this alien avatar that can mirror your

447
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,680
Speaker 8:  facial expressions and you can tweak the responsi so you can see

448
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,360
Speaker 8:  how much it perfectly mirrors your face and like how extreme the

449
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,280
Speaker 8:  expressions are. There's a system that's an update of

450
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Speaker 8:  toy Box where it's just a bunch of little things that you can test to see

451
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,920
Speaker 8:  how advanced the controllers are and how precise they are. So you can

452
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,520
Speaker 8:  play operation which is actually kind of great and I love it.

453
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,440
Speaker 8:  Oh wow. In vr

454
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,160
Speaker 2:  That's actually pretty impressive cuz Toy Box is, at least until now has

455
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,000
Speaker 2:  been pretty rudimentary. Like it's fun, you can goof around but like

456
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,340
Speaker 2:  there's nothing that I would call like fine motor skills in a lot of that

457
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:11,760
Speaker 2:  stuff.

458
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,000
Speaker 8:  You can play Jenga

459
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,020
Speaker 2:  Nice, all right

460
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,520
Speaker 8:  Badly, but I'm bad at real Jenga too. So there's that. And then there's things

461
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,360
Speaker 8:  that are a little bit less clearly toy like and Tech Domo e but are still

462
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,520
Speaker 8:  not really what I would class enterprise or business applications. So they

463
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,770
Speaker 8:  have this genuinely very cool paint system

464
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,760
Speaker 8:  that is a bunch of physical brushes.

465
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,480
Speaker 8:  When I say physical, I mean virtual, but you're in like AR space. You wander

466
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,200
Speaker 8:  around your room, you can pick up these brushes, you have this virtual easel,

467
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,480
Speaker 8:  you can slap paint all over it. You can then take your paintings and you

468
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,440
Speaker 8:  can pin them to the wall because it can detect edges. And so you can

469
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,040
Speaker 8:  create this little virtual gallery. And

470
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,960
Speaker 2:  Just to be clear, this is all in your, you're doing this in your actual space,

471
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,880
Speaker 2:  right? This is not in some like fake VR world. This is happening like if

472
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,720
Speaker 2:  you're in your living room, the idea is you're doing all of this in your

473
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
Speaker 2:  actual living room. Yeah.

474
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,640
Speaker 8:  It can detect your walls, it can do some limited object detection. This

475
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,240
Speaker 4:  Is where the concept starts to click, right? I did a

476
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,940
Speaker 4:  painting, the painting demo too, and you, you create a giant

477
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,720
Speaker 4:  canvas and you just stick it on the wall, but it's the real wall in front

478
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,040
Speaker 4:  of you, right? And so that same concept could be applied to monitors,

479
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,960
Speaker 4:  virtual monitors, which was another demo we tried. When you see that and

480
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,880
Speaker 4:  you use it, you go, oh wow, this is actually so much

481
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,770
Speaker 4:  more compelling than this just cutoff fully

482
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,640
Speaker 4:  immersive VR experience that the Quest and every other headset has really

483
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,120
Speaker 4:  had to date. We should note that there have been mixed reality headsets out

484
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,880
Speaker 4:  there. VAIO is one. In Europe it's, it's even more expensive than the

485
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,280
Speaker 4:  Quest Pro. The software's not as good. So this, this is really the first,

486
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,840
Speaker 4:  I think anyone could try this and theoretically get into mixed

487
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,800
Speaker 4:  reality headset. Apple's headset will do something very similar to

488
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,120
Speaker 4:  this when it comes out as soon as next year, which I think is interesting.

489
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,040
Speaker 4:  But this concept of blending the real with the virtual

490
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,760
Speaker 4:  just has a lot more. I think it just makes you wanna stay in it

491
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,320
Speaker 4:  more because you're not just like bumping into things and you, when you're

492
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,920
Speaker 4:  wearing vr, it's like hard to reach for coffee and drink it while you're

493
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,680
Speaker 4:  doing something, right? I mean the Quest has its guardian and all that, but

494
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,240
Speaker 4:  this just really supercharges that and feeling like you're not totally cut

495
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,280
Speaker 4:  off from the world was for me a huge unlock. I don't know about you Addie,

496
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,600
Speaker 4:  but for me it was,

497
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,560
Speaker 8:  It gets a lot closer to the actual, the things we have talked about is

498
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,040
Speaker 8:  mixed reality heads so far, which is things like ho Lens and Magic Leap which

499
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,000
Speaker 8:  have been able to do the pin a virtual screen to the wall thing

500
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,720
Speaker 8:  forever. Microsoft HO Lens has done really sophisticated occlusion. You can

501
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,470
Speaker 8:  like roll a little ball around a room and it'll mirror the physics.

502
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,320
Speaker 8:  But this does it in a package that is a lot

503
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,760
Speaker 8:  more polished for one thing and more comfortable because they've been working

504
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,560
Speaker 8:  on these headsets for ages and that doesn't have the same field of view restrictions

505
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,520
Speaker 8:  like field of view, headsets, field of view in like wave guide

506
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,200
Speaker 8:  based headsets. The kind where you can actually see the real world. It's

507
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,960
Speaker 8:  getting better but it's still just a fraction of what you would get in an

508
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,200
Speaker 8:  Oculus style headset that's like 110 degrees

509
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,080
Speaker 4:  And just the quality of the graphics and the fidelity because you're cheating

510
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,640
Speaker 4:  and essentially just having a video feed piped in of the world around you,

511
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,370
Speaker 4:  you're not actually trying to put graphics over, you know, real light coming

512
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,320
Speaker 4:  in to your eye, right? I mean you're, I, I wouldn't say that this is like

513
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,200
Speaker 4:  approaching real life at all graphics, but it's definitely like I

514
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,840
Speaker 4:  would actually look at a virtual monitor and this thing and it would feel

515
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,280
Speaker 4:  almost as good as like looking at my real monitor, which says something for

516
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,040
Speaker 2:  Folks who haven't actually been able to try this like me, where would you

517
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Speaker 2:  put that on the spectrum of like, you know, cartoon version of my living

518
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,640
Speaker 2:  room all the way up to it looks like my real living room. Like is

519
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,240
Speaker 2:  it like watching a TV show set in my living room kind of vibes.

520
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,000
Speaker 2:  Like how, how good is this actually coming through?

521
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,600
Speaker 8:  That's actually a really good way to put it but that's the way that I think

522
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,390
Speaker 8:  of it is it's a pretty good quality video but

523
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,240
Speaker 8:  it's a fario is still, it has this weird little quirk where

524
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,360
Speaker 8:  it has this super high resolution screen right in the middle of your face.

525
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,840
Speaker 8:  And that is, I still think better. Like if you're looking at a virtual screen,

526
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,360
Speaker 8:  it's not as sharp as a retina display. You can, it starts getting a little

527
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,720
Speaker 8:  fuzzy if you're looking at, I don't know, Google search results. But it's

528
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,320
Speaker 8:  real good

529
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,240
Speaker 4:  And you know, I think to trying this, it kind of fit in well with

530
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,040
Speaker 4:  these other demos that a and I did, you know, I was in Redmond

531
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,520
Speaker 4:  A was in New York, I went to ME'S research headquarters with

532
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,490
Speaker 4:  Michael Abrash and Z was there and and Boz and all these executives

533
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,280
Speaker 4:  and we tried all these demos and I think Addie, you tried them too. And

534
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,120
Speaker 4:  really what you see is like Meta's just constantly trying to say like

535
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,960
Speaker 4:  look we are working on cool stuff that's going to one day

536
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,640
Speaker 4:  blow your mind. And that's been kind of their story since they really

537
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,500
Speaker 4:  got into hardware and especially since the rebrand and the

538
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,480
Speaker 4:  Quest Pro kind of fits into that. Obviously it's a real product. And the

539
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,400
Speaker 4:  other things we tried weren't, like for example, I tried this personalized

540
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,000
Speaker 4:  spatial audio demo. Addie did you get this? I

541
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,040
Speaker 8:  Don't

542
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,920
Speaker 4:  Think I did. Okay. They'd had this incredible like thing where it

543
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,800
Speaker 4:  was spatial audio but like personalized to

544
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,040
Speaker 4:  where movement was in the room in a way that I can't even describe in this

545
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,600
Speaker 4:  podcast. Like it's something you really have to experience. It was one of

546
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,230
Speaker 4:  the coolest, most visceral demos of technology I've ever

547
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,440
Speaker 4:  experienced. It's not gonna be a product for a really long time. Same thing

548
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,120
Speaker 4:  with their EMG control labs band that lets you

549
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,640
Speaker 4:  essentially control, you know, these headsets with you know,

550
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,400
Speaker 4:  very fine neurons movements and muscle movements in your

551
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,960
Speaker 4:  arm. Which

552
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,120
Speaker 8:  We should be clear that's not like even remotely linked to this, the Quest

553
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,920
Speaker 8:  Pro at this time.

554
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,640
Speaker 4:  No it's not. They hope it will be but like just the theme of the day for

555
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,240
Speaker 4:  me and this included the pro demo was like look at all this cool stuff we're

556
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,640
Speaker 4:  building. We are a serious hardware and research company and they are, they

557
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,360
Speaker 4:  just don't have a compelling mainstream product

558
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,320
Speaker 4:  yet. Right. The quest too is I think estimates say it's, it's sold more

559
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,920
Speaker 4:  than the Xbox, right? It's at a 15 ish million units, which is nothing to

560
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,760
Speaker 4:  like, you know, shake a stick at like I wanna be clear but you know with

561
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,480
Speaker 4:  this pro device it's just like this isn't gonna set the world on fire, right?

562
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,440
Speaker 4:  Like they may sell a few million of these, right? They may get some big enterprise

563
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,140
Speaker 4:  deployments, they're gonna do one with Accenture, right? Which is a ton of

564
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,840
Speaker 4:  people but you know, it still is just gonna be a while for this tech I think

565
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,320
Speaker 4:  to really catch on. And I don't think the pro is that device that maybe

566
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,240
Speaker 4:  some people expected would be like that big aha moment for

567
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,280
Speaker 4:  these headsets.

568
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,920
Speaker 8:  The pro really feels like it is one generation before the thing that actually

569
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,720
Speaker 8:  is useful. It's, yeah so in like tech development there's the concept of

570
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,400
Speaker 8:  the time machine, which is where you compromise on all the stuff that you

571
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,200
Speaker 8:  think is gonna get really good in like five years or so if, I don't know,

572
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,080
Speaker 8:  prices of things come down, batteries get better or whatever. And then you

573
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,660
Speaker 8:  just try to make the best version of the actually hard

574
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,840
Speaker 8:  stuff. The stuff you think is actually hard. That's kind of what this feels

575
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,760
Speaker 8:  like. The battery's not great, the screen, like the pass through camera

576
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,560
Speaker 8:  could get sharper, the screen could get sharper but it has all of

577
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,520
Speaker 8:  the sort of building blocks of this thing that it seems like they think are

578
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,400
Speaker 8:  gonna get into all headsets in five years. Stuff like

579
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,240
Speaker 8:  eye tracking

580
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,040
Speaker 4:  And they have a lot of work to do on the software, right? I think they're

581
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,520
Speaker 4:  actually a lot farther along on the hardware front here. It's,

582
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,040
Speaker 4:  it's impressive honestly that a software company has managed to build

583
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,600
Speaker 4:  such quality hardware in a short amount of time. I think it's actually, I

584
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,440
Speaker 4:  mean Google's starting to do this as well but I think on the software side

585
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,320
Speaker 4:  there's just so much room left. Like you know Addie, I think you

586
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,270
Speaker 4:  mentioned your work rooms, which is their kind of VR like work

587
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,240
Speaker 4:  experience demo was buggy, mine was buggy as well. It was hard to

588
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,640
Speaker 4:  like load certain apps.

589
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,280
Speaker 2:  Well and Alex you had a story just last week that about

590
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,080
Speaker 2:  basically like even Meta knows Horizon is not where it

591
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,920
Speaker 2:  needs to be for all of this stuff.

592
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean they can't get their own employees to dog food and

593
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,360
Speaker 4:  internally test horizon, right? Like the head of Horizon is sending memos

594
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,320
Speaker 4:  saying, look, I'm gonna make you all at least use this once a week because

595
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,720
Speaker 4:  it's just not compelling yet. And that, and I'm talking about Horizon Worlds,

596
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,320
Speaker 4:  which is essentially like their Roblox meets the Oasis in

597
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,720
Speaker 4:  VR type experience where you just hang out with avatars. Like there wasn't

598
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,880
Speaker 4:  a Horizon Worlds demo with the Pro, right? They're really trying to say like,

599
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,320
Speaker 4:  no, we want you to use this for Autodesk and we want you to use this for

600
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,960
Speaker 4:  Adobe software.

601
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,800
Speaker 8:  But it's also notably me that they did not show Autodesk or Adobe software

602
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,580
Speaker 8:  or flight simulators or any of the things that if you go to a company that

603
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,160
Speaker 8:  like HTC that actually cares about enterprise that they will show you,

604
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,480
Speaker 4:  Right? This stuff's not ready. Like the Microsoft stuff. I didn't see any,

605
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,800
Speaker 4:  I didn't get to experience any of the Microsoft stuff like teams in VR or

606
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,360
Speaker 4:  anything like that. Not that that's like a thrilling experience or a demo

607
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,200
Speaker 4:  to write about but this stuff is just early, right? I think like I kind of

608
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,400
Speaker 4:  expected there to be more done on the software side this year frankly.

609
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,240
Speaker 2:  Well and I think one of the big open questions for me, especially with some

610
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,000
Speaker 2:  of this news stuff is like what are they gonna give

611
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,560
Speaker 2:  you to do with it, right? Cause like you're, you're describing these like

612
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,520
Speaker 2:  very cool tech demos. It's, it's like neat and fun but then it's like okay,

613
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,420
Speaker 2:  what most people do when they put on these headsets is like they play Beat

614
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,240
Speaker 2:  Saber and like being able to read my facial expressions is

615
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,040
Speaker 2:  like not gonna make Beat Saber any more fun in any obvious way that I

616
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,600
Speaker 2:  totally understand. And so we're sort of getting to the point where it's

617
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,520
Speaker 2:  like either things like horizon worlds need to start to like really click

618
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,320
Speaker 2:  for people or meta needs to keep inventing and coming up

619
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,960
Speaker 2:  with new things to do for people that actually matches

620
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,320
Speaker 2:  this very cool technology that it's building. Like it's, it's funny you mentioned

621
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,880
Speaker 2:  teams Alex, because that's the kind of thing where it's like, okay now I

622
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,710
Speaker 2:  can see why if you're gonna work with Microsoft having

623
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,440
Speaker 2:  expressions that work and match human expressions, like that's a real meaningful

624
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,240
Speaker 2:  edition you've just made to my like video conferencing life in VR. And we

625
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,160
Speaker 2:  can debate whether video conferencing in VR is like a thing that should exist

626
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,880
Speaker 2:  in the world, but that's a whole separate story. But I do wonder, like I

627
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,800
Speaker 2:  feel like we're at this pace now we're at the, the sort of r and d team is

628
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,720
Speaker 2:  so far ahead of even what the like product team is trying to think

629
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,680
Speaker 2:  about what to do with at this moment. It's gonna be weird, it's gonna be

630
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,320
Speaker 2:  interesting to see if they can catch up to that. But Addie also, it feels

631
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,000
Speaker 2:  like that's the whole industry right now, right? Like I feel like every headset

632
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,880
Speaker 2:  you try on, that's the story. It's like cool technology, I don't know what

633
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,120
Speaker 2:  I'm supposed to do with this. Some

634
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,080
Speaker 8:  Of it, I think that the thing about a lot of enterprise work is that

635
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,710
Speaker 8:  it ends up making compromises that seem like they're

636
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,240
Speaker 8:  making a consumer experience worse but it's because they have

637
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,760
Speaker 8:  actual partners who are using their headsets for real things and the partners

638
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,520
Speaker 8:  say this is the extremely specific thing I need and then they just

639
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,400
Speaker 8:  tailor it toward that. And this seems like meta deliberately not doing

640
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,880
Speaker 8:  that. It seems like they're trying to make an all around consumer headset.

641
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,600
Speaker 8:  They just know that they can't sell it at a consumer price yet.

642
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think that's fair. And I think just they don't have the enterprise

643
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,280
Speaker 4:  software side built up yet. You know, if we talk again in, in a year, right,

644
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,200
Speaker 4:  and we're on the Quest Pro two, the Microsoft software has been integrated,

645
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,100
Speaker 4:  it's starting to get deployed in like factories and tankers, you

646
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,320
Speaker 4:  know, oil rigs, stuff like that. We may be having a different conversation.

647
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,960
Speaker 4:  I think, you know, know Zuckerberg based on my conversations with

648
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,920
Speaker 4:  him, seems okay with this thing being kind of a

649
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,560
Speaker 4:  dud in terms of sales as long as it starts getting developers interested

650
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,160
Speaker 4:  in this mixed reality face tracking stuff and if he can just build, start

651
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,560
Speaker 4:  to build that ecosystem with the hardware, you know, maybe build better hardware

652
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,360
Speaker 4:  down the road, I think that's still a win for them. So I don't think they're

653
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,010
Speaker 4:  expecting this thing to set the world on

654
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,940
Speaker 2:  Fire. So does that mean in meta's head that the Quest two is still kind

655
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,480
Speaker 2:  of the mainstream device for the foreseeable future?

656
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,200
Speaker 4:  For now what they've basically decided to do is create two lines. So there's

657
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,120
Speaker 4:  gonna be a pro line and then the more consumer quest line,

658
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,160
Speaker 4:  you know Zuckerberg said in the interview there's gonna be a Quest three,

659
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,920
Speaker 4:  I think you mentioned four, even five, right? They have multi-year hardware

660
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,080
Speaker 4:  amendments. They're like in this like Google tells you they're in hardware

661
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,120
Speaker 4:  for the long haul, right? I, what I think we're gonna see is the cadence

662
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,080
Speaker 4:  of a new consumer quest next year and then a pro again the following

663
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,520
Speaker 4:  year and then every other year it's gonna be that back and forth. It's funny

664
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,220
Speaker 4:  like there he wasn't really clear with me as we heard like

665
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,800
Speaker 4:  about how they're making money on this, but it's clear that it's still gonna

666
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,640
Speaker 4:  be a long, long time before these headsets give any kind

667
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,520
Speaker 4:  of, you know, money back to meta that that flows in a meaningful way

668
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,400
Speaker 4:  to them. I think they're may be making a slight profit on the, on a per unit

669
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,840
Speaker 4:  basis, but I mean we heard 'em say like no way when you factor in everything

670
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,480
Speaker 4:  else,

671
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,120
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah, I mean I liked that his, his overarching message whenever you

672
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,920
Speaker 2:  asked him about money was basically like, we are prepared to spend a

673
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,560
Speaker 2:  tremendous amount of money to make all of this work and like if it does we'll

674
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,480
Speaker 2:  make so much money in the long run it won't matter and if it doesn't we're

675
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,560
Speaker 2:  all screwed anyway so it doesn't matter. Like

676
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,200
Speaker 4:  That's I think a pretty good, pretty good assessment. But

677
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,120
Speaker 2:  I guess the good news is then it seems like for Quest two users is

678
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,720
Speaker 2:  that like if they've done all this work to make it more balanced and feel

679
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,880
Speaker 2:  better on your head, like this should give people hope for the Quest three,

680
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,680
Speaker 2:  right? That some of this stuff might come to that even the less advanced

681
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,560
Speaker 2:  tech but like a nicer headset to wear for long periods of time could be in

682
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,280
Speaker 2:  folks' future, which seems like a win.

683
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think you're gonna see this face tracking and mixed reality stuff

684
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,360
Speaker 4:  come into the cheaper quest line. They just have to figure out how to do

685
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,480
Speaker 4:  that at a cheaper price point and at scale. And that's what this first pro

686
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,440
Speaker 4:  was kind of meant to show them. So this tech is definitely gonna come downstream

687
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,200
Speaker 4:  to everything. That's the whole idea is to seed the more expensive far

688
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,800
Speaker 4:  out stuff in the pro line before the the Quest line and eventually the ideas

689
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,520
Speaker 4:  this all eventually converges with AR glasses, which are

690
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,120
Speaker 4:  still several years out.

691
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,400
Speaker 8:  Alex, what did you think of the stylists, the stylist is the goofiest part

692
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,960
Speaker 8:  of this headset to me? Yeah,

693
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,160
Speaker 4:  They have this, you know, the I the controllers are a huge upgrade and they

694
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,080
Speaker 4:  have this haptic kind of stylist experience. I don't know, I

695
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,050
Speaker 4:  thought I was fine. I'm not gonna be like writing on little virtual sticky

696
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,010
Speaker 4:  notes on a, they love this idea of like, you go up to a whiteboard

697
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,920
Speaker 4:  in VR or mixed reality and pen of VR sticky note and you can

698
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,430
Speaker 4:  have unlimited ones and you can erase everything and move. I'm just like,

699
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,730
Speaker 4:  I, I don't like sticky notes in real life. I don't know why I would want

700
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,720
Speaker 4:  them in virtual reality or why I would want to like the time it takes

701
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,480
Speaker 4:  to draw something, right? Like if I'm in a computer, I wanna

702
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,240
Speaker 4:  do things as quickly as possible. That's the whole reason I'm using a computer.

703
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,150
Speaker 4:  So I think this concept of like bringing human, you know, the way that

704
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,040
Speaker 4:  we have to do things physically into VR is like how iOS used

705
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,760
Speaker 4:  to be sic, right? It's like we're just in this phase of like trying to

706
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,000
Speaker 4:  integrate virtual and physical and we haven't figured out the new virtual

707
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,560
Speaker 4:  paradigms of how we actually do things efficiently, right? And the same,

708
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,840
Speaker 4:  I don't know. So I guess I'm saying I wasn't that impressed

709
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,120
Speaker 2:  About this is just sitting here like I have thousands of virtual sticky notes

710
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,920
Speaker 2:  all over my apartment right now.

711
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,800
Speaker 8:  I should maybe describe it a little bit because it's honestly even weirder

712
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,480
Speaker 8:  than the thing that, the way you're describing it, which is that there is,

713
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,840
Speaker 8:  you can hold the controller and typically there's this wristband at the bottom.

714
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,580
Speaker 8:  You can unclip the wristband and then put the world's tiniest

715
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,040
Speaker 8:  plastic nub onto where the wristband at the bottom was. And then you flip

716
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,560
Speaker 8:  the controller around and you hold it backwards and then you can hold it

717
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,520
Speaker 8:  like a pen, like incredibly thick marker and you press down on

718
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,920
Speaker 8:  a real surface and the ideas that it's supposed to give you actual visceral

719
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,640
Speaker 8:  like feedback because you're on a table or a wall or something. It's just

720
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,480
Speaker 8:  such a weird addition. I don't know, I'm just, I want

721
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,360
Speaker 8:  to understand the process by which they came up with this idea and

722
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,520
Speaker 8:  decided to implement it.

723
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,040
Speaker 4:  I get it. This, we wanna have this for businesses. You know, you need a stylist

724
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,430
Speaker 4:  if you're, you know, a thought worker or whatever. Like do

725
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,030
Speaker 8:  You, does anyone think

726
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,000
Speaker 4:  That? I don't know. Please write into David call the Verge cast

727
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,240
Speaker 4:  hotline if you use a stylist on a daily basis and we'll put them all in the

728
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,640
Speaker 4:  next episode per

729
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,920
Speaker 2:  Sold eight hours on stylists. I'm ready for this. Literally anytime. Well

730
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,280
Speaker 8:  The thing that makes me wonder about is like whether they're going to try

731
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,200
Speaker 8:  to sell this as AER art device. Like one of the only

732
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,680
Speaker 8:  actually business oriented things business loosely that I tried was a DJ

733
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,280
Speaker 8:  deck where the idea was that it was super clear and it has all this very

734
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,640
Speaker 8:  fine feedback so you can turn little knobs and see everything. And I think

735
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,400
Speaker 8:  that if you're trying to do something that you wanna have a really

736
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,230
Speaker 8:  big canvas for, here's a world where VR headsets are good art

737
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,120
Speaker 8:  tools. I think this is not the world we're in right now, but I wonder if

738
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,160
Speaker 8:  that's the kind of thing that eventually they try for,

739
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,800
Speaker 2:  It's also what all of these companies are desperate to have people do, right?

740
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,600
Speaker 2:  It's why these VR companies talk so much about like architects

741
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,520
Speaker 2:  and creatives and car designers. It's like, it's just such a sexy

742
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,070
Speaker 2:  use case to have people making this stuff. And if you give them these

743
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:55,010
Speaker 2:  like fine tools, like I can totally imagine the meeting that led

744
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,520
Speaker 2:  to we have to make a VR stylist. Whether or not anybody will use it I, I

745
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,780
Speaker 2:  think is a, is a completely different story. But I can absolutely imagine

746
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,620
Speaker 2:  like the room in the Microsoft offices where somebody was

747
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,560
Speaker 2:  like, but but how will I create my beautiful drawings in virtual

748
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,920
Speaker 2:  reality with these dumb controllers? And then somebody is like, I don't

749
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,640
Speaker 4:  Think anybody draws on whiteboards anymore. If, correct me if I'm wrong,

750
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,600
Speaker 4:  you know, DME at Alexy Heath. I don't, I think whiteboards are

751
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,400
Speaker 4:  not long for this world personally. I will just say before we move

752
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,280
Speaker 4:  off this, cuz I feel like this is important going into this demo, I really

753
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,160
Speaker 4:  wanted the virtual office demo to blow me away cuz I've been

754
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,120
Speaker 4:  been reporting on what this headset is gonna be like. I know the direction

755
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,800
Speaker 4:  they're going. Mixed reality, the concept of not having a big

756
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,720
Speaker 4:  monitor in front of me at my desk, having a comfortable headset and huge

757
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,280
Speaker 4:  giant monitors everywhere I want and a keyboard in front of me and being

758
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,160
Speaker 4:  able to do my work that way. That I would buy a headset, I would buy a

759
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,680
Speaker 4:  $2,000 headset for that, right? If it had spatial audio and all these things,

760
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,560
Speaker 4:  the demo was not that good and it wasn't because the mixed reality

761
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,120
Speaker 4:  wasn't great. It's just, you know, these little things like the keyboard

762
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,360
Speaker 4:  tracking, like my keyboard was fuzzy, right? And so I'm like looking and

763
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,520
Speaker 4:  I don't touch type like Addie, so like I need to look down sometimes and

764
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,360
Speaker 4:  it was buggy and kind of slow and it's like you just, you feel that one to

765
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,040
Speaker 4:  two second like delay between your input and

766
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,960
Speaker 4:  something happening that's like I could be more productive in real life.

767
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

768
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,760
Speaker 8:  You have an operating system on top of your operating system at

769
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,600
Speaker 4:  This point. Exactly. And until they cross that threshold where, you

770
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,450
Speaker 4:  know, it is literally just as fast as like typing into my browser on

771
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:31,080
Speaker 4:  my monitor at home. I think the work from home

772
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,040
Speaker 4:  mixed reality headset idea that all these companies want to have is

773
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,880
Speaker 4:  not gonna happen. And I really thought it might happen with this headset,

774
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,000
Speaker 4:  but I don't think anyone's gonna be sitting there even plugged in at their

775
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,400
Speaker 4:  desk cuz they have to be, cuz the battery life, I don't think people are

776
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,380
Speaker 4:  gonna be sitting there for hours, you know, browsing in their Quest

777
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:47,800
Speaker 4:  Pro.

778
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,640
Speaker 8:  I'm really curious where reality os, if they had really pushed on the

779
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,560
Speaker 8:  idea that they wanted their own operating system would've gone

780
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,840
Speaker 4:  Well, they're still working on it. I think, you know, I and others have reported

781
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,610
Speaker 4:  on this that there was some internal tension about do we do a fully custom

782
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:05,520
Speaker 4:  OS in the near future or do we still rely on Android? This is an still an

783
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,830
Speaker 4:  Android based system, I think they still want to do a

784
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,400
Speaker 4:  fully integrated os. It's just doing that on the

785
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,280
Speaker 4:  time scale that they wanted for the air glasses wasn't gonna make sense.

786
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,160
Speaker 4:  And it's one of those things that they're working and kind of fiddling with

787
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,920
Speaker 4:  in the background and maybe one day, you know, we'll see something like that.

788
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,520
Speaker 4:  And maybe that does solve it. You know, that's the problem is that they're

789
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,480
Speaker 4:  not this kind of full stack software to hardware company like Apple

790
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,240
Speaker 4:  is. And that's really where I think Apple's strategic advantage in this space

791
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,400
Speaker 4:  where that really matters in something like a headset is gonna make a huge

792
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,460
Speaker 4:  difference.

793
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,820
Speaker 2:  Totally. All right, we needed to take a break. Thank you both. But stick

794
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:44,320
Speaker 2:  around and we are gonna come back and talk about VR gaming, which is not

795
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,640
Speaker 2:  what Mark Zuckerberg wants to talk about, but it's a thing a lot of people

796
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,280
Speaker 2:  do when they put on their headsets while we

797
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:54,510
Speaker 2:  ride

798
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,000
Speaker 2:  back.

799
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,440
Speaker 9:  Kara Swisher here, you may know me as the person who made Mark Zuckerberg's

800
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,400
Speaker 9:  sweat pushed Kim Kardashian to talk dollars or got Secretary

801
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,760
Speaker 9:  Mayor Pete Buttigieg to eat a juicy strawberry live

802
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,680
Speaker 9:  on stage. Okay, that one was awkward, but

803
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,680
Speaker 9:  that's what I like to do. Make powerful people comfortable with

804
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,593
Speaker 9:  being uncomfortable. Now I'll be doing that on my new show from New

805
00:47:16,593 --> 00:47:20,580
Speaker 9:  York Magazine on with Kara Swisher. We'll bring you news and the news

806
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,240
Speaker 9:  makers I'm paying attention to and we'll do it twice a week on Mondays

807
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,200
Speaker 9:  and Thursdays. Go check it out on with Kara Swisher wherever you

808
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:28,360
Speaker 9:  get

809
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:33,280
Speaker 9:  your

810
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:33,700
Speaker 9:  podcasts.

811
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,300
Speaker 10:  Hey everybody, it's Eli Editor in Chief of the Verge. I am thrilled to announce

812
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,140
Speaker 10:  that after two years of work we're unveiling a brand new redesign of

813
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,820
Speaker 10:  our site@theverge.com. We've got all the basics, we've got a fresh,

814
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,420
Speaker 10:  modern, new logo, we've got really fast and beautiful new article

815
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,400
Speaker 10:  pages. They're bright colors all over the site that highlight our award-winning

816
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,140
Speaker 10:  journalism. But most importantly, we have a brand new homepage.

817
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,740
Speaker 10:  It brings the best of old school blogging to a modern

818
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,660
Speaker 10:  newsfeed experience so we can take the entire noisy world of

819
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:07,580
Speaker 10:  tech and science all over the internet and have our expert, senior reporters

820
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,500
Speaker 10:  and editors curate it for you all day long. It's a really big change. I

821
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,340
Speaker 10:  like to say that we're gonna revolutionize the media with blog posts and

822
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,740
Speaker 10:  I think we are, Check it out, it's at the verge.com

823
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:25,530
Speaker 10:  right

824
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,200
Speaker 10:  now.

825
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,880
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. As we've been talking about the tech industry's vision for

826
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,070
Speaker 2:  VR and mixed reality and AR and whatever you wanna call it,

827
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,000
Speaker 2:  is huge, too huge, some would argue, but it's huge.

828
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,880
Speaker 2:  But even Mark Zuckerberg knows it's gonna take a number of years to

829
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,720
Speaker 2:  get to that point. So what is VR good for right now? Ask

830
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,530
Speaker 2:  around and almost everyone will give you the same answer. Games

831
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:52,360
Speaker 2:  before. VR is the future of video chat and music and like

832
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,980
Speaker 2:  society at large. It is potentially the future of video

833
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,520
Speaker 2:  games, but how's that going to figure it out? I called up Chris Grant, who

834
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,960
Speaker 2:  is the Verges group publisher and was formerly the editor in chief of our

835
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,440
Speaker 2:  sister publication Polygon Chris Grant. Hello, thank you for being

836
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,040
Speaker 2:  here.

837
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,680
Speaker 11:  Great pleasure.

838
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,040
Speaker 2:  You are a person who plays video games. I think it is safe to say, are you

839
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,720
Speaker 2:  also a person who plays VR video games? Like what's your, what's your

840
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,440
Speaker 2:  VR setup right now?

841
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,360
Speaker 11:  I do have a quest too. I have been known to play games inside

842
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,200
Speaker 11:  virtual reality at times. I would say I largely find those to be, let's

843
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,190
Speaker 11:  call them detours in my gaming habits, not necessarily

844
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:28,800
Speaker 11:  destinations. What

845
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,920
Speaker 2:  Do you play? What gets booted up first when you start playing the Quest

846
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,880
Speaker 11:  Re before, which is a whole as game that they put

847
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,520
Speaker 11:  into vr. Yeah, and one of the things that we could talk about, but I, VR

848
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,960
Speaker 11:  for me is not a place to play whole as games. It's a, it's a place

849
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,920
Speaker 11:  to play 20 minute sections of games here and there. So I, I would

850
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,720
Speaker 11:  say the game I'm playing is resonating before still maybe forever.

851
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,640
Speaker 2:  Wait, that's really interesting. So I wanna talk about the like business

852
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,840
Speaker 2:  mechanics of all this, but you just raised to think I think is really interesting.

853
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,800
Speaker 2:  Like my assumption with all of this has been that if only VR

854
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,440
Speaker 2:  could get good enough games, it would move up

855
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,240
Speaker 2:  that ladder and start to be like, instead of sitting down on your couch to

856
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,920
Speaker 2:  play your PS five, you would stand up and put on your quest too. And the

857
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,200
Speaker 2:  only reason you're not doing that is because the games aren't good enough.

858
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,400
Speaker 2:  But you're kind of making me think that maybe that's just not true. Like

859
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,760
Speaker 2:  maybe the activity is so different that it's just not the thing you're gonna

860
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,080
Speaker 2:  wanna do. Even if the games are amazing. Resume

861
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,000
Speaker 11:  Before is a banger all time classic and the VR

862
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,680
Speaker 11:  adaptation's excellent, not only does it look good, but they redid the whole

863
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,280
Speaker 11:  thing in Unreal Engine, but it plays really well. It's a, it's a smart reinterpretation

864
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,240
Speaker 11:  of the game. It just, I don't wanna spend more than half an hour at a time

865
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,120
Speaker 11:  with a heavy sweaty headset on my head getting freaked out by

866
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,240
Speaker 11:  zombies with their heads popping off. I do think the mechanics of games,

867
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,040
Speaker 11:  and we could talk about the sort of business of, of the Oculus store, but

868
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,760
Speaker 11:  the mechanics of games and the refinement of game mechanics to a controller.

869
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,280
Speaker 11:  We can say keyword of mouse too, if that's your, that's your thing. But

870
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,040
Speaker 11:  the refinement of those mechanics is not a casual thing. Right? That's 30

871
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,920
Speaker 11:  years of UX and player input evolution. Yeah. And the games and the sort

872
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,700
Speaker 11:  of systems and vernacular of games that have been adapted to that are pretty

873
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,680
Speaker 11:  sophisticated. And so I think a VR cement like the we, it has a huge

874
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,560
Speaker 11:  wow effect. You play a VR game and you go, Whoa, I I'm gonna

875
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,160
Speaker 11:  get me one of those, I'm gonna lose weight tomorrow. Right? In the same

876
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,320
Speaker 11:  way that the we and we fit where this huge wow effect, right? You're gonna

877
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,200
Speaker 11:  play we sports every day. This is the next step in your journey

878
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,740
Speaker 11:  to physical perfection. And people bought the Wes and they bought the wee

879
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,360
Speaker 11:  fits and they, and that system had relative so very low attach rate. People

880
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,600
Speaker 11:  were not buying games, they got the we and they put it under their couch.

881
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,240
Speaker 11:  Interesting. And so for me, the big question on Quest is like people buy

882
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,840
Speaker 11:  them, it's selling very well. Quest two, what are they doing with it, right?

883
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,600
Speaker 11:  It was a huge seller last Christmas. What are they doing with it? Are they

884
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,320
Speaker 11:  actually playing games? How much are they playing? What kinds of games are

885
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,880
Speaker 11:  they playing? And then in turn, what kinds of games should developers build

886
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,880
Speaker 11:  for that audience? What do they want? What will they pay for it? And I don't

887
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,680
Speaker 11:  know, I'm I'm, I don't think there's right answers there yet.

888
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,640
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean it's interesting cuz like I I think about the the like canonical

889
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,480
Speaker 2:  games of vr, right? You get the like the Beat Savers and the Super Hots of

890
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,840
Speaker 2:  the world and the thing a lot of those games have in common is they're

891
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,440
Speaker 2:  super deliberately designed to be played for short periods of time that it's

892
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,360
Speaker 2:  like there is no game in VR that is like play this for eight straight hours.

893
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,160
Speaker 2:  Like it just, it just doesn't exist. It's like a 30 minute activity and then

894
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,760
Speaker 2:  you move on.

895
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,800
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Arcade tower, even short levels, right? Supernatural being another

896
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,040
Speaker 11:  sort of VR hit, very beat savory, but with all

897
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,840
Speaker 11:  the self-help mechanics of going to the gym or going club

898
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,120
Speaker 11:  plus a subscription which fixes the economics. Yeah, the logic of that makes

899
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,800
Speaker 11:  a lot of sense to me. That's something that VR is very good at and can sort

900
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,840
Speaker 11:  of duplicate. There's the exercises you're gonna do are somewhat limited,

901
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,120
Speaker 11:  but you're not gonna exercise for eight hours. You're not gonna have a sesh

902
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,000
Speaker 11:  in the same way. But I think before is like a famously long game,

903
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,180
Speaker 11:  games long, it's a lot of, it's not an eight hour game, it's like a 20 hour

904
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,480
Speaker 11:  game. And so you're playing games like that and you're not gonna do it in

905
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,360
Speaker 11:  the same kind of session. It's exhausting both physically but also like

906
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,880
Speaker 11:  input wise, right? The amount of inputs you're receiving is is just a

907
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,720
Speaker 11:  lot. There's some eye strained stuff and like Perce and

908
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,480
Speaker 11:  other things where you might just get a little bit, you know, soured on

909
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,300
Speaker 11:  a stint that long but at some point maybe glasses get better, they get

910
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,000
Speaker 11:  smaller, all those other things might fix that problem. But you still wanna

911
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,780
Speaker 11:  be moving around and like doing gun play in your living

912
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,400
Speaker 11:  room for more than 30 minutes at a time. And I, you know, I do think that

913
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,560
Speaker 11:  there's a world in which we use VR headsets to play traditional games with

914
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:24,480
Speaker 11:  a controller our lap on a giant 200 inch virtual screen

915
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,120
Speaker 11:  that seems interesting to me. Yeah,

916
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,840
Speaker 2:  It's like the Netflix things where basically it's like you're watching Netflix

917
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,440
Speaker 2:  but it's as if you're in a movie theater on a gigantic screen. I think like

918
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,800
Speaker 2:  as resolutions get higher, that actually seems like it'll be very cool. It's

919
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,440
Speaker 2:  not there yet but it's the kind of thing that I can sort of see where that

920
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,320
Speaker 2:  would go with something like the experience that we've had. It's like, it

921
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:45,120
Speaker 2:  always reminds me of the people who like sit in stadiums and play

922
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,770
Speaker 2:  Mario Cart on the jumbotron. It's like just the, the novelty of

923
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:52,200
Speaker 2:  that is worth it and is very cool. But, so, okay, so coming at this from

924
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,760
Speaker 2:  like the business side right there, there's been this question for a long

925
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,600
Speaker 2:  time of like where are the AAA games, right? Like where is the the halo for

926
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,440
Speaker 2:  vr, why isn't Call of Duty coming to vr? And my assumption

927
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,960
Speaker 2:  has just always been that there's this like chicken and egg problem of these

928
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,720
Speaker 2:  games are very expensive to make and there aren't enough people who have

929
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,240
Speaker 2:  these headsets to be able to make them very profitable. And until they are,

930
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,440
Speaker 2:  they're not gonna make the games. But until they make the games, there's

931
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,920
Speaker 2:  not gonna be enough people buying the headsets to make them profitable. Do

932
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,240
Speaker 2:  you think it's that or is it just that this is like a fundamentally different

933
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,520
Speaker 2:  thing and we're gonna have to do fundamentally different things with it?

934
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,960
Speaker 11:  I don't think it's just chicken or egg. So I think some of it, you know,

935
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,790
Speaker 11:  they've sold 15 million or so Quest twos, that's

936
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:31,750
Speaker 11:  roughly what they've sold of Xbox Series X and S to

937
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,440
Speaker 11:  date came out roughly the same time. There's more triple A games on that

938
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,400
Speaker 11:  platform. Why the audience is proven that they will purchase

939
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,320
Speaker 11:  60 to 78 now dollar games and play them for long periods of time and purchased

940
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,740
Speaker 11:  them over and over again. That the, the console lifespan has a certain

941
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,920
Speaker 11:  fixed expectation. I think a lot of development just isn't clear on what

942
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,360
Speaker 11:  that is for vr. You're gonna make a big investment for what? For Facebook's

943
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,880
Speaker 11:  digital store. Like is that, how long will it be around for? Will the, will

944
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,160
Speaker 11:  my game work on Future Hardware? Where is their long term hardware commitment?

945
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,480
Speaker 11:  Do they wanna make games? I think Facebook has already sort of, I don't

946
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,880
Speaker 11:  wanna say straight up like Osborne effect, but they're already very

947
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,160
Speaker 11:  clearly telegraphing this isn't a game platform, right? This is where you're

948
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,640
Speaker 11:  gonna do your job in the future. This is where you're gonna go on dates,

949
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,280
Speaker 11:  right? Like they're, they're just out there. I think even in the store they

950
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,120
Speaker 11:  call it experiences now, not games. Like what are the top selling experiences?

951
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,280
Speaker 11:  Which

952
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,040
Speaker 2:  Is bonkers to me because it is so transparently going to either work or not

953
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,520
Speaker 2:  work as a game platform way before any of that becomes anything like this

954
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,240
Speaker 2:  is the thing about this that drives me kind of nuts

955
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,200
Speaker 11:  I think. So some of it is is about that it's about, you know, it's the install

956
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,170
Speaker 11:  basis strong, but what's that attach rate? How many people are gonna buy

957
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,970
Speaker 11:  games on it? How many games are they gonna buy? How much time are they gonna

958
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:41,640
Speaker 11:  spend in the game? And and consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation

959
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,960
Speaker 11:  consoles, Nintendo's consoles obviously have proven to have very high attach

960
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,640
Speaker 11:  rates and very high amounts of time spent. I think it's also about the price

961
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,360
Speaker 11:  and what kind of games you can make with it. And this isn't to diminish

962
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,480
Speaker 11:  the hardware, right? The Switch is an old Tera based

963
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,000
Speaker 11:  Android console. But the quest too is, is also

964
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,680
Speaker 11:  running effectively cell phone hardware. And so from a production

965
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,400
Speaker 11:  standpoint, they're not gonna make a AAA game the way we think of AAA on

966
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,080
Speaker 11:  at least an Xbox in a PlayStation. They could make something where we think

967
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,800
Speaker 11:  of it on a switch, but from a sheer production

968
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,210
Speaker 11:  cost standpoint, it will not be as expensive to make games on that

969
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,920
Speaker 11:  platform because it doesn't have the graphics capabilities that would require

970
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,320
Speaker 11:  that kind of production to develop. It's part of it.

971
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,400
Speaker 2:  So like the reason to not make Call of Duty for VR is because you literally

972
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,120
Speaker 2:  just can't, you

973
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,800
Speaker 11:  Can make a Call of Duty, right? And Call of Duty on mobile's successful

974
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,280
Speaker 11:  PUBG on mobile's successful. Like there's other ways to make those games.

975
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,320
Speaker 11:  Fortnite on mobile's obviously successful when and if you can get it in

976
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,880
Speaker 11:  various app stores in per ongoing lawsuits. But

977
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,240
Speaker 11:  for mobile games and I think you know VR thing of VR is a way like

978
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,190
Speaker 11:  a mobile adjacent platform. This is not as simple

979
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,480
Speaker 11:  as just porting something from a thing. It's entirely different audience

980
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,400
Speaker 11:  in some ways of who's buying these things and what they intend to get out

981
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,040
Speaker 11:  of it. I think you can also look at the store, just look at the stores themselves

982
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,150
Speaker 11:  and see what the average price is for games that are on the top selling

983
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,160
Speaker 11:  list. It's not $60, there's nothing for $60 on

984
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,000
Speaker 2:  There, right? It's a lot of like 20 and 30 bucks.

985
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,480
Speaker 11:  Which also tells me like what do people think they're getting when they

986
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,840
Speaker 11:  spend $20 on a game? They don't think they're getting a $60 game on sale

987
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,600
Speaker 11:  for 20, they think they're getting a $20 game. It's gonna have a different

988
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,280
Speaker 11:  level of engagement and have a different level of depth, probably a different

989
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,160
Speaker 11:  level of length. A lot of these games and you look through the top sellers

990
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,880
Speaker 11:  list, they are aad, you know Creed, Rice Glory, you have like a

991
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,040
Speaker 11:  boxing game. It's punch Audi not again, not to diminish that kind of game.

992
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,600
Speaker 11:  I think that is the kind of experience you want. Richie's plank walking

00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,240
Speaker 11:  experience is still on the top list. Like that's a one of my fas on Quest

994
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,040
Speaker 11:  too. Yeah, it's the best party game for vr. You give it to people and you

995
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,680
Speaker 11:  watch them embarrass themselves is they walk out over a plank. Yeah. You

996
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,570
Speaker 11:  know, down the side of a skyscraper. This is I guess to be fair

997
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:49,480
Speaker 11:  to, to meta slash Facebook, this is not a game, this is an experience

998
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,040
Speaker 11:  and that's a top seller. So like what do people want out of this? And I

999
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,600
Speaker 11:  love what they want is novelty. They want to move their bodies, they want

1000
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,480
Speaker 11:  fitness and they want motion. I don't know what the triple A

1001
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,560
Speaker 11:  audience looks like there and in so much as there is a triple A audience

1002
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,410
Speaker 11:  that wants triple A games, these are in some ways solved

1003
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:10,320
Speaker 11:  problems. We have triple A experiences on console and I'd

1004
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,040
Speaker 11:  be, we're miss have to bring up obviously PlayStation vr, PSV two.

1005
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,480
Speaker 2:  I was just about to ask Yeah cuz Sony seems like it should be the one with

1006
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:21,040
Speaker 2:  the most to gain by theoretically like fusing some of those two things together,

1007
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,680
Speaker 2:  right? Like big install base full of people who will spend money, who

1008
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,960
Speaker 11:  Like triple A games, right?

1009
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,480
Speaker 2:  Who like big feeling expensive games

1010
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,440
Speaker 11:  And PSV R one sold you know like 6 million units. This is not going to change

1011
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,280
Speaker 11:  the world. This is, I don't think there was anything close to like a runaway

1012
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,790
Speaker 11:  hit. They had some interesting experiences there. They had Batman Acam

1013
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,000
Speaker 11:  game kind of thing that was neat that ran off the same engine was maybe

1014
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,800
Speaker 11:  the same team getting games that exist in this world that are really

1015
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,720
Speaker 11:  good. They had a Sobo Studios who, who did Astro bot, which

1016
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,880
Speaker 11:  was still is the best PlayStation five game. I'm sorry, please don't at

1017
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,720
Speaker 11:  me, but that's the right answer. Fair enough. They made a VR version of

1018
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,000
Speaker 11:  that game that was excellent, right? Platformer graphics weren't super,

1019
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,440
Speaker 11:  didn't have to be, it was a lot of fun to play in VR and the same, I thought

1020
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,120
Speaker 11:  Lucky Tale was a lot of fun to play. And then the first quest when the Rift,

1021
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,280
Speaker 11:  when it came out, geez, long time ago. So I think there are these sorts

1022
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,000
Speaker 11:  of experiences that are like triple A light that you can do in vr. You know,

1023
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,650
Speaker 11:  Sony showed off for places of VR too, which will be a tethered

1024
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:20,880
Speaker 11:  headset, it will not be standalone the way Quest is, which gives it the

1025
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,760
Speaker 11:  power, the processing power of the PlayStation five. They can put

1026
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,400
Speaker 11:  significantly better graphics in this thing than they could put on a quest

1027
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,200
Speaker 11:  by a long shot. But you have a tether on you which also limits the amount

1028
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,880
Speaker 11:  of physical freedom or mobility you're gonna have, which probably changes

1029
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,720
Speaker 11:  the kind of games you're gonna make. The install base isn't portable to

1030
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,600
Speaker 11:  other VR headsets depending on the kind of game you make. If you're making

1031
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,760
Speaker 11:  a game that's gonna use all that power, it's kind of pretty much going PC

1032
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,640
Speaker 11:  and on PlayStation five and that's it. But they have a horizon game, a

1033
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,400
Speaker 11:  game using the the horizon setting. And I think you

1034
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,320
Speaker 11:  play Allway in it but it's a bow and arrow game, you know what I mean? Like

1035
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:57,160
Speaker 11:  there's all these different combat mechanics in the console game but in

1036
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,040
Speaker 11:  the VR game you shoot a bow. Why? Cuz it feels good

1037
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,680
Speaker 11:  to shoot a bow in vr. Yep. It does not feel good to jump

1038
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,480
Speaker 11:  into, run into all these other things. And so playing to the strengths of

1039
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,320
Speaker 11:  the platform is good at that. What feels good inside of VR is

1040
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,640
Speaker 11:  smart, but that game, as far as I can tell, I have not demoed PSV two yet.

1041
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,480
Speaker 11:  It's gonna be AAA in a sense production wise, but is it gonna

1042
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,440
Speaker 11:  be triple A in terms of length, in terms of game play depth now? But I think

1043
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,680
Speaker 11:  we have to reevaluate what, what triple A might mean on vr.

1044
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it does seem like, I just get a kick outta the fact that like in the

1045
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,640
Speaker 2:  Quest store in particular, it seems like the single most common review

1046
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,600
Speaker 2:  is like fun game too short four stars, it's like over and

1047
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,800
Speaker 2:  over and over again. It's like, boy that was cool and it was 20 minutes and

1048
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,640
Speaker 2:  now I'm kind of wondering like, okay, if they took that game and gave you

1049
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,380
Speaker 2:  six hours of it, like is that, is that actually what you want? Are we

1050
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,080
Speaker 2:  sure And I think it's super interesting but then I think about the, the sort

1051
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,880
Speaker 2:  of flip side of this, like to go back to the the sort of Fortnite and pubs

1052
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,800
Speaker 2:  of the world, that kind of thing seems like it should be in

1053
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,680
Speaker 2:  theory like perfectly suited for some of these devices. Whether they

1054
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,480
Speaker 2:  become like the VR versions of themselves and like game streaming theoretically

1055
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,360
Speaker 2:  solves some of these processing problems over time. And so it feels, it

1056
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,350
Speaker 2:  just feels like maybe we're sort of winding towards a world

1057
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:16,600
Speaker 2:  where a thing you wear on your face with a mobile processor isn't the sort

1058
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,920
Speaker 2:  of gating thing at once was. And then we come back to this sort of like fundamental

1059
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,720
Speaker 2:  question of is this actually what you want? Like is, is VR Fortnite the

1060
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,560
Speaker 2:  way Fortnite is currently constructed actually a thing that you would want?

1061
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,240
Speaker 2:  And the longer we talk, the more I'm thinking the answer is maybe not.

1062
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,600
Speaker 11:  I mean to make a decision VR I'll, I'll redefine Fortnite not as a first

1063
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,560
Speaker 11:  person shooter slash building battle royal game, but just a game. A

1064
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,000
Speaker 11:  place you hang out with friends. Yes. In the sense, in that sense, Fortnite,

1065
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,680
Speaker 11:  Roblox, Minecraft, maybe those are all different solutions to the same kind

1066
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,720
Speaker 11:  of problem. I do think it's reasonable to assume that there might be some

1067
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,450
Speaker 11:  kind of game that you have a VR interface where you are mostly

1068
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:55,680
Speaker 11:  socializing or hanging out while also performing a shared activity like

1069
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,800
Speaker 11:  shooting something. Mark

1070
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,480
Speaker 2:  Zuckerberg is so happy you just said that by the way.

1071
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,400
Speaker 11:  I know I'm gonna mark cool your chat's butt. I'm about to, about to take

1072
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,120
Speaker 11:  you down a notch I think for vr I, I wanted to bring up two other examples

1073
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,960
Speaker 11:  on, on consoles, but something that's about the time you spend or or what

1074
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,960
Speaker 11:  you're doing there. You know on consoles one of the things you get from

1075
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,840
Speaker 11:  console based VR headset is you get AL seven. I think it's still a go to

1076
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,800
Speaker 11:  example of a full blown actual game that's new. This is not

1077
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,600
Speaker 11:  a port like Revo five where they just put a VR mode in it, right?

1078
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,480
Speaker 11:  V re oh seven was first unveiled, was unveiled in a, what was called the

1079
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,160
Speaker 11:  kitchen demo and it was just this kitchen scene that ended up being in the

1080
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,840
Speaker 11:  game kind of a version the game. But in VR it's unveiled for psvr it was

1081
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,210
Speaker 11:  freaky af and it turns out the whole game's in vr, they just announced re

1082
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:41,160
Speaker 11:  eight is also gonna have a full VR mode. Like this is kind of wild that

1083
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,280
Speaker 11:  they do this, but this idea that like that's a, that's an actual triple

1084
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,840
Speaker 11:  A game in vr. How big is the audience for that? How many people wanna do

1085
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,800
Speaker 11:  that? I mean Max for PlayStation VR max 6 million,

1086
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,120
Speaker 11:  it's not that big of a hit and that's not enough to make full games for

1087
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,920
Speaker 11:  it. But if you're adapting existing games that already have first person

1088
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,040
Speaker 11:  interfaces, maybe it's a reasonable cost. You mentioned game streaming,

1089
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,960
Speaker 11:  I wanna get back to that too. Game streaming is really fascinating for a

1090
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,840
Speaker 11:  lot of reasons. Rip Stadia where I went out, if you guys can't see me on

1091
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,320
Speaker 11:  camera, but game streaming comes with its own latency problems that are

1092
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,400
Speaker 11:  at some point the laws of physics make it impossible. Our brains can cover

1093
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,880
Speaker 11:  some lag on a TV screen. I think that the kind of latency that you would

1094
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,600
Speaker 11:  need to have in a VR headset to not get sick, you're sort

1095
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,520
Speaker 11:  of pushing up against maybe what's possible there. Yeah. So I dunno if games

1096
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,120
Speaker 11:  streaming necessarily solves it, at least if you're not streaming off something

1097
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,860
Speaker 11:  local, There are wireless adapters for quests that work now and stuff,

1098
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,480
Speaker 11:  but, but games I think where people wanna spend time, the idea of hanging

1099
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,080
Speaker 11:  out and hanging out in virtual reality, Big Mark really wants that to

1100
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:40,040
Speaker 11:  be the thing, right? Horizons Yes is this bet

1101
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,640
Speaker 11:  they're making. It's a very weird bet the last time that

1102
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,040
Speaker 11:  they broadcast their user, they boasted they had 300,000

1103
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,600
Speaker 11:  players, 300,000 players, inhabitants. What do you even call, I

1104
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,880
Speaker 11:  know 300,000 people,

1105
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,200
Speaker 2:  People with no legs just sort of bobbing around the

1106
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,120
Speaker 11:  Metaverse. Tell us how you looking things. You have 3000 people and and

1107
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,560
Speaker 11:  they boasted about it, right? That was like a press release. They put that

1108
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,800
Speaker 11:  out there in the world and my immediate thought reading that's like 300,000

1109
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,360
Speaker 11:  is the number that you shut your thing down at, right? That's like this

1110
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,880
Speaker 11:  isn't big enough to sustain. You got 15 million users and you're bragging

1111
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,480
Speaker 11:  about 300,000 of them showed up to your goofy thing. If I was making Triple

1112
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,160
Speaker 11:  A games and you told me your hit is 300,000 you sold depending on the size

1113
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,120
Speaker 11:  of the game, I might make a game for it if I was a small studio. But that

1114
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,070
Speaker 11:  is not anywhere close to where a AAA studio is gonna

1115
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,880
Speaker 11:  need that attach rate to be. And Horizons is free. And

1116
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,000
Speaker 11:  so for me this really pushes the question of like, what do people want do

1117
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,840
Speaker 11:  in here? I I thought about with Horizons, I thought about Project Spark.

1118
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,160
Speaker 11:  Do you remember Project Spark?

1119
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,160
Speaker 2:  I don't think so.

1120
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,760
Speaker 11:  Well nobody else does it either. This is kind of my point. Project Spark

1121
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,200
Speaker 11:  was a game game building thing that Microsoft released with Xbox One when

1122
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,760
Speaker 11:  it first came out. Okay, It was paid and then certain amount of people used

1123
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,960
Speaker 11:  it. They eventually went free to play to try and drive engagement when they

1124
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,160
Speaker 11:  had about 200,000 users. And this was a thing that grew after that. When

1125
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,720
Speaker 11:  it was once it was free but it still was not big enough to sustain and they

1126
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,560
Speaker 11:  shut it down. That's like what a game decision looks like.

1127
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,520
Speaker 11:  And with Horizons, from my vantage point, the audience data

1128
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,680
Speaker 11:  suggests that this is not a hit. And the only reason it's still here and

1129
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,360
Speaker 11:  being both of us is cuz it's so key and integral to Meta's

1130
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,040
Speaker 11:  entire play here. That this is not just a gaming console, this is

1131
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,800
Speaker 11:  in fact the gateway to your virtual reality future that

1132
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,520
Speaker 11:  we insist is going to happen any day now stay tuned, just

1133
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,080
Speaker 11:  hold tight. It's gonna happen. And

1134
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,270
Speaker 2:  Meta has made very clear that it's willing to like burn a lot of money and

1135
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:34,200
Speaker 2:  waste a lot of time waiting for that day to come. And so I think

1136
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,180
Speaker 2:  the fact that Meta is going to say 300,000 people as a smashing success is

1137
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:42,080
Speaker 2:  like the goal posts are weird and confusing and Meta is gonna move them

1138
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,900
Speaker 2:  every time it has to in order to continue to seem like it's being

1139
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,760
Speaker 2:  successful. But Meta can also afford to burn tens of billions of dollars

1140
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,600
Speaker 2:  trying to make this thing happen without any knowledge that it's gonna happen.

1141
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,440
Speaker 2:  And most of the folks making games can't do that. And you know

1142
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,480
Speaker 2:  the game making industry much better than I do. But it seems like there are

1143
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,280
Speaker 2:  a lot of places where every game you make is like an existential

1144
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,480
Speaker 2:  thing functionally every time

1145
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,040
Speaker 11:  The ongoing economics of Triple A game development are increasingly make

1146
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,000
Speaker 11:  or break. You are all in and these games have to be

1147
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,920
Speaker 11:  monstrous hits or failure is more or less catastrophic. The amount

1148
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,840
Speaker 11:  of time that a AAA studio will sit on a game to lay a

1149
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,680
Speaker 11:  game launch in order to get it to a place where they can be somewhat

1150
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,000
Speaker 11:  assured that it'll be enough of a hit. I think Ubisoft is a really fascinating

1151
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,590
Speaker 11:  study here, right? Ubisoft is giant AAA studio. They kind of only make

1152
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:34,080
Speaker 11:  hits, it's their whole business. They spend a lot of time, their teams are

1153
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,630
Speaker 11:  comically large and they skeleton bones still is not

1154
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:40,200
Speaker 11:  out. This game is supposed to be out years and years and years and years

1155
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,000
Speaker 11:  and years ago and it's supposed to be out this year. And it's like, is it,

1156
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,720
Speaker 11:  I don't know, I don't think they've even delayed it, but, well it doesn't

1157
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,600
Speaker 11:  seem likely. This is a company that like will just wait until they have

1158
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,360
Speaker 11:  the product that they think is enough of a hit decided by focus groups

1159
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,520
Speaker 11:  and play tests and mock reviews and everything else. Then once they release

1160
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,140
Speaker 11:  a game, they will wait until it becomes a hit. Rainbow

1161
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:04,000
Speaker 11:  Succeeds for honor, right? They'll put these games out that do not inspire

1162
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,360
Speaker 11:  confidence at launch and they'll just wait. They will iterate and wait until

1163
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,860
Speaker 11:  it is a hit because they have to be hits. You see this in some of the acquisition

1164
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,600
Speaker 11:  strategy for both Xbox and PlayStation. PlayStation buying Bungee.

1165
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,920
Speaker 11:  Yep. For Destiny and Bungee now went from being, we don't wanna just be

1166
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,440
Speaker 11:  the halo company to not being just the Destiny company. Yeah. Microsoft

1167
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,360
Speaker 11:  buying active vision in part for not, not just call duty,

1168
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,240
Speaker 11:  but World Warcraft and Candy Crush, these other massive hits. And I think

1169
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:32,920
Speaker 11:  that having a hits driven business is increasingly putting a lot of pressure

1170
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,560
Speaker 11:  on triple A game development. In part that's the production cost. It's the

1171
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,520
Speaker 11:  winner takes all nature of hits driven business. It's the social dynamic.

1172
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,760
Speaker 11:  If you play a game, you play it with your friends and then they all play

1173
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,080
Speaker 11:  then by the same game and they play it over time. That's Fortnite, that's

1174
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,160
Speaker 11:  also Destiny. That's also World of Warcraft for the last 15 years. I think

1175
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,680
Speaker 11:  it creates this interesting fun space underneath Triple A where you also

1176
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,480
Speaker 11:  see some of Microsoft's investments for Game Pass, right? Getting a studio

1177
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,440
Speaker 11:  like Obsidian to make a AAA game rpg. But instead

1178
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,870
Speaker 11:  of being 40 hours, it's like 10 right? With

1179
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:06,270
Speaker 11:  Outer Worlds. That's exciting for me. That's like as somebody who doesn't

1180
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:09,580
Speaker 11:  have a hundred hours to spend on RPGs anymore. So I think there is a lot

1181
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,880
Speaker 11:  of fun room in the middle and I think VR can be a big part of that. Making

1182
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,400
Speaker 11:  games that are different experiences that don't have to have the same level

1183
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,840
Speaker 11:  of production value cuz they bring something else to the table. They're

1184
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,550
Speaker 11:  bringing unique, innovative experiences, different kinds of play dynamics.

1185
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:24,560
Speaker 11:  And that's partially why I even have a quest, even though I don't play it

1186
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,040
Speaker 11:  a lot. I like trying things on it. I like seeing what they're

1187
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,920
Speaker 11:  doing there. And I usually am not looking for triple A games if I

1188
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,400
Speaker 11:  wanna play triple A games, I've got an RTX 30 80 that I don't

1189
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,240
Speaker 11:  use enough just waiting for me to put something on it.

1190
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,080
Speaker 2:  Big picture question before I let you go here. Like is there a world in the

1191
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,000
Speaker 2:  near future in which it would ever make sense for somebody to

1192
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,880
Speaker 2:  do like full Triple A, like for GTA six to be like

1193
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,680
Speaker 2:  a, a true first class VR citizen? Like is that a

1194
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,800
Speaker 2:  thing we want, Is that a thing they're gonna do? Like are we close to that

1195
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,920
Speaker 2:  making any sense short of Facebook? Just like writing checks for billions

1196
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,520
Speaker 2:  of dollars to get people to do this.

1197
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,960
Speaker 11:  And quite frankly if, if we're talking exclusively, I don't think there's

1198
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,600
Speaker 11:  enough money under the sun to get grant theft auto to that's fair be if

1199
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,800
Speaker 11:  you are exclusive, but

1200
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,840
Speaker 2:  Even if, if Mark Zuckerberg goes to the, the Grant Theft Auto team and is

1201
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:17,760
Speaker 2:  like, I will, I will give you, you know, we, we want it to be just

1202
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,120
Speaker 2:  as good on Quest as it is on any other platform. We want this big open world

1203
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,400
Speaker 2:  game that people are gonna spend thousands of hours in. Like does everybody

1204
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,160
Speaker 2:  kinda look at that and be like, that's not, I'm not sure that's what VR game

1205
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:27,800
Speaker 2:  should be.

1206
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,200
Speaker 11:  Yeah. As a thought experiment, I say no, I don't think they would do it

1207
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,400
Speaker 11:  for a bunch of reasons. Not least switches. It's a distraction from their

1208
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,200
Speaker 11:  core business, which is over here. Fair. Do I think that there's a world

1209
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,120
Speaker 11:  in which on something like psv, do you get an exclusive first person mode

1210
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,640
Speaker 11:  where some parts of the game or some modes in the game are, there's a first

1211
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,120
Speaker 11:  person mode on Grand Theft five, or maybe that is in vr similar to the way

1212
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,100
Speaker 11:  Res and Evil seven and eight soon to be, have this VR functionality

1213
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,560
Speaker 11:  maybe. And maybe some people do wanna play it that way, or maybe some people

1214
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,720
Speaker 11:  at least want to experience what it's like to walk around inside of that

1215
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,440
Speaker 11:  world, even if it's not the actual full gameplay suite

1216
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,800
Speaker 11:  of mechanics. You know, I think about the VR headset that came with Nintendo

1217
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,200
Speaker 11:  Labo, the Labo VR set, and just being able to go in

1218
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:11,040
Speaker 11:  Mario Odyssey and like look around certain environments with the

1219
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,860
Speaker 11:  VR headset, a crappy VR headset looking at environments built

1220
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:18,620
Speaker 11:  on now seven year old or so Android mobile

1221
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:22,240
Speaker 11:  hardware. And it was fun. Yeah. And so I do think that there's this novelty

1222
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,040
Speaker 11:  that would I want to do that? Sure I would, but I wanna play the whole game

1223
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,020
Speaker 11:  and is that how I would wanna experience it every day? I, me personally

1224
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,920
Speaker 11:  know the studio, I think it's way too high of a risk and too high of a distraction.

1225
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,720
Speaker 11:  What they really need is for that game to be as big of a hit or bigger than

1226
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:39,120
Speaker 11:  grant theft. Auto five was, You know, I think even with re evil eight VR

1227
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,640
Speaker 11:  mode coming later, the answer is that they have to make a hit game

1228
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,840
Speaker 11:  first. That's the obligation, that's the requirement. That's the harder

1229
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,640
Speaker 11:  thing to do these days. And so it's not to say it's an afterthought, I think

1230
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,040
Speaker 11:  it's gonna be neat. I think you'll continue to see investment in it, but

1231
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,590
Speaker 11:  I don't think anyone has really figured out what it is that

1232
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:59,160
Speaker 11:  VR gamers consumers want to spend their time doing

1233
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:03,040
Speaker 11:  besides getting fit. Listen to some good tunes and swing in

1234
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,280
Speaker 11:  bats or swords or other objects around.

1235
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:10,040
Speaker 2:  And not only their time, but their $60 and their $70

1236
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,440
Speaker 2:  and that kind of stuff.

1237
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,000
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Has yet to be, you know, at least exclusively a VR game that's commanding

1238
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,420
Speaker 11:  that kind of price.

1239
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,080
Speaker 2:  Totally. All right, Chris, thank you. Appreciate it. This was

1240
