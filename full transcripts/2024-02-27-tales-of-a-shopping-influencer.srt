00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:06,285
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the economic theory of

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:10,125
Speaker 1:  Dave and Busters. I'm my friend David Pierce and I am currently on my

4
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:14,045
Speaker 1:  way to a new bagel shop, which in my life at this point in my

5
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:17,885
Speaker 1:  life, counts as a huge life event. See, when I move somewhere new, I

6
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,765
Speaker 1:  immediately go on a grand quest for three things, a really

7
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:25,205
Speaker 1:  great cup of coffee, a really great deli sandwich, and a really great bagel

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,525
Speaker 1:  in New York. I found all three of those things, new York's good like that

9
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:32,765
Speaker 1:  in San Francisco. I found the first two, but never really found a

10
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:36,445
Speaker 1:  bagel that I loved. And now that I'm in the DC area, coffee

11
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:40,485
Speaker 1:  was easy to find, found a good deli sandwich, but it's been like four years

12
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:44,965
Speaker 1:  and I still haven't found the bagel. But this new place

13
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:48,685
Speaker 1:  just opened like a week ago in my neighborhood. Everybody says it's great.

14
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:52,645
Speaker 1:  I've been burned before, but I'm gonna go try it because that is my job.

15
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:56,605
Speaker 1:  This is my quest. I will find a great bagel. Anyway,

16
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:59,685
Speaker 1:  we have an awesome show coming up for you today. We're gonna do two things.

17
00:01:00,095 --> 00:01:03,805
Speaker 1:  First, we're gonna talk about this app flip, which is like If, you took the

18
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:07,525
Speaker 1:  TikTok shop and the shopping stuff in Instagram and the shopping stuff in

19
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,485
Speaker 1:  Pinterest and just sort of smooshed it all together into a social

20
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:15,765
Speaker 1:  media app that is nothing but shopping and it's kind of working.

21
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,245
Speaker 1:  We're gonna get to the bottom of what's going on and why this thing is so

22
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,885
Speaker 1:  successful. Then we're gonna talk about the Fujifilm X 106,

23
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:26,925
Speaker 1:  which is the successor to the camera that The internet has spent the last

24
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:30,445
Speaker 1:  like three years totally obsessed with. It's beautiful,

25
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,605
Speaker 1:  it's cool, it takes neat photos. People are very excited about

26
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:38,125
Speaker 1:  it. We're gonna figure out if this is really worth the upgrade. All that's

27
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,965
Speaker 1:  coming up in just a sec, but first I have to go spend what I can only assume

28
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:45,525
Speaker 1:  is going to be an alarming amount of money on a bacon, egg and cheese. This

29
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:46,845
Speaker 1:  is The Vergecast. We'll see you in a sec.

30
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:10,525
Speaker 1:  Welcome back. All right, I'm home. I'm in the studio. I have eaten

31
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:14,165
Speaker 1:  the bacon, egg and cheese. It was good, but I think the hunt for the really

32
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:17,645
Speaker 1:  great one still continues. This one did have a little honey on it though,

33
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:21,685
Speaker 1:  which I liked a lot. That was a good tip. Anyway, let's get to the show.

34
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:25,605
Speaker 1:  Over the last few weeks the Verges, Mia Sato has been moonlighting

35
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:29,725
Speaker 1:  as a shopping influencer on an app called Flip. She hasn't told

36
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:33,565
Speaker 1:  me much about how it's going or what she's been up to in her time

37
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:37,165
Speaker 1:  as a shopping influencer, but this app is weird and

38
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:40,565
Speaker 1:  strange and she's going to tell us about all of her adventures.

39
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:42,445
Speaker 1:  Mia Sato, Welcome To, The Vergecast.

40
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:43,245
Speaker 4:  Thank you.

41
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:47,405
Speaker 1:  So I'm told the First thing you wanna do is share with me a video

42
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,925
Speaker 1:  that you made that the people need to hear.

43
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:52,165
Speaker 4:  Yes, the people need to hear this. It's very important.

44
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,605
Speaker 1:  Let's, let's just play this and then we'll see where we go.

45
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:59,285
Speaker 5:  Wow. I absolutely love this pure sonic facial

46
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:03,005
Speaker 5:  steamer because it feels so good on my face.

47
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:05,125
Speaker 5:  As you can see, it's really steaming

48
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:05,485
Speaker 4:  My face.

49
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:10,165
Speaker 1:  What, what is happening here? I need you to explain yourself. Okay,

50
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:14,125
Speaker 4:  So David, what if I told you that I had a TikTok for you where it was

51
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:16,445
Speaker 4:  only ads? Would you be interested?

52
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:20,525
Speaker 1:  I mean I would, I would make the slight argument that that might just be

53
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:23,285
Speaker 1:  called TikTok, but yes.

54
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:27,645
Speaker 4:  And you would use my referral code to sign up so that we could both get like

55
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:28,605
Speaker 4:  30 to $50.

56
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:32,165
Speaker 1:  Listen, if there is one thing, I believe it's that The internet is made for

57
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:36,765
Speaker 1:  scamming your way into 50 to a hundred dollars worth of free

58
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:39,725
Speaker 1:  stuff on The internet, most of which will be garbage, but some of which will

59
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:39,965
Speaker 1:  be great.

60
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:43,405
Speaker 4:  Okay. That's the, I love that we're on the same page because that's exactly

61
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:47,405
Speaker 4:  what I did, but more like $400 worth of stuff and I used my friends to do

62
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:51,365
Speaker 4:  it. Oh wow. And I'm here to tell my story and maybe get you on So.

63
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:52,125
Speaker 4:  I can get more stuff.

64
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:56,525
Speaker 1:  What, what is this app? It's not TikTok. It sure sounds

65
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:58,805
Speaker 1:  like TikTok. What app are we talking about here?

66
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:03,125
Speaker 4:  It's this app called Flip If. you are on TikTok and you use

67
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,445
Speaker 4:  Flip. You'll know exactly what to do because it, the user experience is very

68
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:10,365
Speaker 4:  similar. It's a vertical video feed where you swipe up and

69
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:14,325
Speaker 4:  you get new stuff except on Flip there is like a dislike button and a

70
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:18,085
Speaker 4:  like button and every video is about a product

71
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,125
Speaker 4:  that you can buy directly from that video. And there's also

72
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,965
Speaker 4:  like a shopping page similar to TikTok Shop where it's just loaded

73
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:27,245
Speaker 4:  with a bunch of stuff.

74
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:31,365
Speaker 1:  So it's shopping all the way down. Like it's, it's videos about

75
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,925
Speaker 1:  products you buy the products, you make a video about the product you bought,

76
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:37,885
Speaker 1:  other people buy the product and it's, it's just this endless cycle of

77
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:41,325
Speaker 1:  content about products that you can buy to make content about.

78
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:44,845
Speaker 4:  Exactly. It is completely circular, which is actually brilliant. Like you

79
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,765
Speaker 4:  can only make videos about stuff you've purchased there. It's like kind of

80
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,365
Speaker 4:  like TikTok and social media gamified to the extreme. So

81
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:56,685
Speaker 4:  as you're scrolling this feed there is a little counter in the top right

82
00:05:56,685 --> 00:06:00,325
Speaker 4:  hand corner with a dollar amount and every time you watch a video you earn

83
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:04,165
Speaker 4:  a couple pennies. You just keep going and then you have sort of

84
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:08,045
Speaker 4:  a fake amount of money that you can then use as like

85
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:11,965
Speaker 4:  basically a 30% off coupon for anything you buy inside the money can

86
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:15,925
Speaker 4:  be, can cover up to 30% of your purchases. So it encourages

87
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,925
Speaker 4:  you to keep watching videos, you comment on them, you like them, sometimes

88
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:23,845
Speaker 4:  you buy stuff, you're racking up Little little points as you go

89
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:24,125
Speaker 4:  along.

90
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:25,965
Speaker 1:  Where did this app come from?

91
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:30,325
Speaker 4:  So. I heard about it through friends who had also been doing what I

92
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:34,165
Speaker 4:  did invite a bunch of friends so that you have kind of like an endless stream

93
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:38,245
Speaker 4:  of of fake money to buy stuff with and it's a

94
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:42,125
Speaker 4:  startup. It raised I think maybe around a hundred million dollars in the

95
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,765
Speaker 4:  last round and it has been kind of bubbling

96
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:49,645
Speaker 4:  under the surface for a bit. There have been a few articles about it's launch

97
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:53,565
Speaker 4:  last year, but mainly it seems like

98
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:57,085
Speaker 4:  a place where people jump on it with like a

99
00:06:57,325 --> 00:07:01,245
Speaker 4:  lucrative referral program that they're doing right now. Buy one thing, make

100
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:05,045
Speaker 4:  a weird video and then maybe never come back. But then there are people like

101
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:08,685
Speaker 4:  me who spend ungodly amounts of time on it because it's like,

102
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:12,685
Speaker 4:  it feels like an upside down wacky world of like

103
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:15,045
Speaker 4:  things we already know and are very familiar with.

104
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,125
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I do think there, there is a fascinating sort of statement about

105
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:22,685
Speaker 1:  the world inside of this app that I'm not sure this app wants to be making,

106
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:26,645
Speaker 1:  but tell me about like these videos I'm imagining I would say

107
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:30,205
Speaker 1:  like Mia I love you but your video is not particularly

108
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:33,845
Speaker 1:  enticing. I don't feel like I got to the end of that and I'm like, you know

109
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:37,525
Speaker 1:  what I need now as a facial steamer. Are you like worse

110
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:41,485
Speaker 1:  than average on Flip among the influencers? Are you better

111
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:43,965
Speaker 1:  than average? Like what kind of stuff do you see scrolling in this feed?

112
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:44,485
Speaker 1:  The

113
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:48,005
Speaker 4:  Feed is so chaotic. It is truly

114
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:51,725
Speaker 4:  like I was hooked from like the first five minutes because you get on the

115
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:55,165
Speaker 4:  feed and it is like nothing you've seen before. It's like the collection

116
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:59,085
Speaker 4:  of the worst videos you've ever seen and then some really like kind

117
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:03,045
Speaker 4:  of cringey like really tough watches one after another and

118
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:06,965
Speaker 4:  I'm obsessed with that. So there's several buckets of people on flip.

119
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:10,845
Speaker 4:  There are people who, like I said, buy one thing are

120
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:14,805
Speaker 4:  told that hey, if someone buys stuff off of your video that you made,

121
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:18,485
Speaker 4:  you can make money to. It's like an affiliate marketing scheme. They make

122
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:20,725
Speaker 4:  one video and then that's all that's on their profile.

123
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:24,605
Speaker 6:  So this is the clips, the clip,

124
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:26,725
Speaker 6:  a very nice clip.

125
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:31,325
Speaker 4:  There are the people who maybe have like something of a following on other

126
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:34,165
Speaker 4:  platforms and they've just jumped to this platform to see if this can become

127
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:37,925
Speaker 4:  a revenue stream for them. So they're making slightly more polished videos.

128
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:38,805
Speaker 4:  This

129
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:42,685
Speaker 7:  Is the men's sponge gel super buffer and smells so, so good.

130
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:46,565
Speaker 7:  I'm not going to open this because I got this as part of a birthday gift

131
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:48,285
Speaker 7:  for my boyfriend, but I've got this.

132
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:52,245
Speaker 4:  There are children, like literal children in school making videos

133
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:55,685
Speaker 4:  about phone cases. Those are extremely hilarious. Oh

134
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,925
Speaker 8:  God my phone died. I hate it.

135
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:00,805
Speaker 9:  Oh yo. I got portable charges.

136
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:02,525
Speaker 8:  Oh my God, thank you.

137
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:07,205
Speaker 4:  There are people doing like mimicking the

138
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:11,125
Speaker 4:  videos of legitimate and established influencers. What's

139
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:15,045
Speaker 10:  Up Flip fan. First time reviewer here just got my first

140
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:18,285
Speaker 10:  purchase. Mommy and Sonos Polar fleece,

141
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:21,485
Speaker 10:  olive Green, super comfy.

142
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,285
Speaker 4:  There are the honest reviewers just you

143
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:30,005
Speaker 4:  know your friend saying like, oh I don't really know if I liked this product.

144
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:34,565
Speaker 11:  Hmm, extremely disappointed. This course set

145
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:38,445
Speaker 11:  it's over a hundred dollars. I got it because I saw this

146
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:41,925
Speaker 11:  outfit from Sophia Regatta and I was like Ooh, lemme try that.

147
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:46,365
Speaker 11:  Look at this. This is the center one cup. It's higher than the

148
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:47,325
Speaker 11:  other one. Which

149
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:51,285
Speaker 4:  Is kind of like, I think the ideal that Flip Wants, it's all about this like

150
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:55,325
Speaker 4:  authenticity, honest reviews. They very much

151
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:59,045
Speaker 4:  lean into like it's good that these people are not practiced influencers.

152
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:03,325
Speaker 1:  Does that make sense to you as an approach when the whole point

153
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:06,245
Speaker 1:  of every single video is to sell you a product?

154
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:10,765
Speaker 4:  No, I mean obviously there's a tension there that nobody wants to

155
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:14,685
Speaker 4:  acknowledge, which is that you can make honest videos and you still

156
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:17,605
Speaker 4:  make money when people watch those videos. Right? You still make money even

157
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:21,485
Speaker 4:  if nobody buys it. Also there is tremendous financial incentive

158
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:24,285
Speaker 4:  to get people to buy it from your video. Like that is kind of the whole point.

159
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:28,525
Speaker 4:  And I think that you know the, the company can push this

160
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:32,405
Speaker 4:  sort of, this is authentic, this is real line as much as they

161
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:36,125
Speaker 4:  want. But that does not remove the central tension, which is

162
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:40,765
Speaker 4:  you are paying people really, really bad influencer rates

163
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:44,965
Speaker 4:  to make content for stuff that you otherwise would be outsourcing to people

164
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,285
Speaker 4:  who are charging like thousands of dollars a post.

165
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,645
Speaker 1:  Okay so part of this makes sense to me and part of it doesn't, we've seen

166
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:54,005
Speaker 1:  this with a lot of shopping apps, whether it's it was Wish a bunch of years

167
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:57,805
Speaker 1:  ago or she and and Timo and what the TikTok shop is doing where they

168
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:01,645
Speaker 1:  pour a bunch of money into subsidizing this for everybody. So you get cheap

169
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:05,165
Speaker 1:  stuff, you get referral codes. That part of this makes sense to me. There's

170
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,525
Speaker 1:  a bunch of money coming in, it's not sustainable but somebody can afford

171
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:11,045
Speaker 1:  to pump this up for a while. For you as a user, it sounds like,

172
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:15,085
Speaker 1:  if I'm understanding correctly, you make money just by watching

173
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:19,165
Speaker 1:  videos. Yes. And you also make money when people buy

174
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:22,405
Speaker 1:  products after they click on videos that you make?

175
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:26,965
Speaker 4:  Yes. It's like money on both sides. Money being sort of

176
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:30,685
Speaker 4:  like imprecise term because some of these are just like points basically.

177
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:32,885
Speaker 4:  Sure. Just with the dollar a sign in front of it. Yeah,

178
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:36,565
Speaker 1:  It all sounds a little like Dave and Busters where you just like spend a

179
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:39,645
Speaker 1:  bunch of money to buy your way into this sort of teeny tiny fake economy

180
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:43,605
Speaker 1:  that has no bearing on anything and no one actually understands how any

181
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:46,005
Speaker 1:  of it works but they get money and you don't at the end

182
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:50,205
Speaker 4:  1000% I am making videos for Chuck E Cheese tokens. Like that's what's

183
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:50,445
Speaker 4:  happening

184
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:54,365
Speaker 1:  And yet you decided to let this completely take over your life because

185
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:58,085
Speaker 4:  It's kind of fun. It's kind of, it's kind of fun

186
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:02,165
Speaker 4:  and it's, that is like the weird part of this. I think I have like

187
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:06,405
Speaker 4:  $80 right now in watch points I'll call them. Okay,

188
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:10,045
Speaker 4:  that's how much I've scrolled this feed and mind you I'm making like two

189
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:14,245
Speaker 4:  to 6 cents of you. Something like that. So I've been watching a lot of

190
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:14,485
Speaker 4:  videos.

191
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:18,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So take me through kind of the the the Mia economy on Flip. You've

192
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:22,165
Speaker 1:  been in this for a while, you referred a bunch of people. What has your

193
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:25,405
Speaker 1:  voyage through this app been like over the last month or so?

194
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:29,645
Speaker 4:  So first I invited a bunch of friends and I think by

195
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:33,485
Speaker 4:  the end I had like almost $400 worth of credit.

196
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:37,565
Speaker 4:  And this is also kind of a little sneaky but the credit can be used to cover

197
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:41,645
Speaker 4:  up to 95% of the price of an item. So

198
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:45,485
Speaker 4:  if I had like a $100 jacket or something, I would pay 95

199
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:48,885
Speaker 4:  bucks and I would pull it out of my flip referral money,

200
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:53,365
Speaker 4:  So I invite a bunch of friends. I rack up all this money and then I just

201
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:54,845
Speaker 4:  started buying random stuff.

202
00:12:57,685 --> 00:13:01,445
Speaker 5:  I think this is a hat and this is interesting. There is a

203
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:05,885
Speaker 5:  packing slip in the package and it's shipped to me

204
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:10,045
Speaker 5:  but it's billed to the flip shop and it's like

205
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:14,285
Speaker 5:  their address. I'm pretty confident that this is all being drop

206
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:17,805
Speaker 5:  shipped and they're just fronting the money for the purchase

207
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:22,005
Speaker 5:  and then you are paying them, you know, five bucks or however, whatever the

208
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:24,165
Speaker 5:  difference is after your 95% off coupon.

209
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:29,165
Speaker 4:  I bought clothes, I bought eye masks like skincare

210
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:33,005
Speaker 4:  eye masks. I bought the facial steamer of course that I

211
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:37,205
Speaker 4:  absolutely love how it steams my face. I bought mushroom

212
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:41,245
Speaker 4:  chocolates, I bought like a 35 millimeter film scanner. I

213
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:45,205
Speaker 4:  bought the protein powder of course I

214
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:48,885
Speaker 4:  tried to buy a variety of stuff just to see what would show up to my house.

215
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:53,605
Speaker 5:  These two are from a clothing brand

216
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:57,645
Speaker 5:  that was sort of suspiciously cheap about two shirts and they were each

217
00:13:57,825 --> 00:14:01,165
Speaker 5:  12 to $15 So I'm not expecting much.

218
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,925
Speaker 5:  And the other I think are socks

219
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:08,165
Speaker 1:  That So I did this one time with Wish for a story. I actually

220
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:11,365
Speaker 1:  never ended up writing. I bought like a few hundred dollars worth of

221
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:15,605
Speaker 1:  obvious knockoffs of gadgets. There was like a thing that was clearly

222
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:19,405
Speaker 1:  a GoPro but wasn't a GoPro. I was kind of amazed at the spectrum

223
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:23,405
Speaker 1:  of quality. It was kind of a total grab

224
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:26,925
Speaker 1:  bag of whether any of this stuff was gonna be any good or even what it looked

225
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:30,805
Speaker 1:  like on the listing page. Was that your flip experience too?

226
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:35,165
Speaker 4:  I think it's yeah a hit or miss thing because there are some brands on flip.

227
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:39,205
Speaker 4:  I should also also mention that brands have to like apply to be on it and

228
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:43,125
Speaker 4:  for every purchase that is made on flip, flip takes a cut. Okay.

229
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,525
Speaker 4:  So it's like affiliate marketing on affiliate marketing. It's really,

230
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:50,845
Speaker 4:  there's a lot of layers here. So there are legit brands, several makeup

231
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,725
Speaker 4:  brands that people always post normal tiktoks of, right? Like

232
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:58,645
Speaker 4:  they're very popular brands. The film scanner was I think maybe a Kodak

233
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:00,365
Speaker 4:  one. It really runs the gamut.

234
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:04,645
Speaker 1:  Okay. But then again if I'm understanding the, the flip economy correctly,

235
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,925
Speaker 1:  buying and receiving the products is only the first part of

236
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:12,685
Speaker 1:  the process. You then are immediately supposed to turn around

237
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:16,925
Speaker 1:  and make content and this is where I think you, you hit your true star

238
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:20,445
Speaker 1:  turn at least as far as I can tell, which is Mia Sato

239
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:24,325
Speaker 1:  weird product reviewer on The internet. Tell me about protein

240
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:26,485
Speaker 1:  powder Hawking Mia, what's her deal?

241
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:30,885
Speaker 4:  Okay, so that was the first video I made. Mm. My first instinct was to

242
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:35,005
Speaker 4:  be kind of an asshole about it. I haven't opened

243
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:38,525
Speaker 4:  this and I haven't eaten it but I think I

244
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:42,285
Speaker 4:  recommend it. In fact I do recommend it. Okay. That video

245
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:46,445
Speaker 4:  has 860 views. Okay. And I've

246
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,365
Speaker 4:  made a dollar and 92 cents, which actually is really good

247
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:54,445
Speaker 4:  for views. Nobody has bought it from my video but it's pretty good.

248
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:58,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's a pretty good conversion. And then the next day I decided to actually

249
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:02,205
Speaker 4:  use the protein powder in a protein shake and I made another video

250
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,365
Speaker 4:  of course. Okay. Another update. I made a protein shake

251
00:16:06,395 --> 00:16:10,045
Speaker 4:  with the protein powder and it is absolutely horrendous.

252
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:14,685
Speaker 4:  It is horrifyingly bad. It is so fucking bad. Do not buy this.

253
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:19,525
Speaker 1:  So a, I appreciate the journalistic integrity here. This is good.

254
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:23,725
Speaker 1:  But also this is the thing that people are watching in deciding maybe

255
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:27,485
Speaker 1:  I'll buy this product. Like you're, you're making money off of telling people

256
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,205
Speaker 1:  how terrible these protein shakes are.

257
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's hysterical also multiple people put it in their cart from my video.

258
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:33,725
Speaker 4:  Good

259
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:34,005
Speaker 1:  Lord

260
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:38,125
Speaker 4:  So I have to say that. Like if I tried a little bit harder, imagine what

261
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,725
Speaker 4:  I could do. Imagine how much, how much flip money I would have.

262
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:44,965
Speaker 1:  So the like the neg as a product review strategy is kind of

263
00:16:44,995 --> 00:16:48,765
Speaker 1:  amazing. Yeah. This this is a thing we need to explore like The Verge just

264
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:51,965
Speaker 1:  nagging products is is maybe a thing we should start doing more of. I love

265
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:55,565
Speaker 1:  this. Did you do the mushroom chocolates? This is the other one I'm fascinated

266
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:58,085
Speaker 1:  by. 'cause I feel like the the facial steamer is like look it's steaming

267
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:01,005
Speaker 1:  my face. Like I get that trying to explain to people whether they should

268
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:04,925
Speaker 1:  buy mushroom chocolates based on a recommendation from a stranger

269
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,205
Speaker 1:  on The internet seems like an interesting content challenge.

270
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:12,125
Speaker 4:  Well it's actually really easy because the mushroom chocolates look kind

271
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,765
Speaker 4:  of cute. Mm. One thing about a lot of the reviews that I saw

272
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:19,405
Speaker 4:  was that the people will say stuff about the

273
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:23,005
Speaker 4:  product that has nothing to do with the product, right? They will say

274
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:27,285
Speaker 4:  here it is, I just got this. Check it out. Right. Like they

275
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:28,125
Speaker 4:  don't use it.

276
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:32,485
Speaker 12:  Yo what else? Flippers just got this bucket hat from dumb club on

277
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,125
Speaker 12:  flip, it's got sick,

278
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:39,885
Speaker 12:  sick, I can't even explain the word for it. Characters. It's

279
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,285
Speaker 12:  got all the characters from their website on here. Sick quality,

280
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:44,325
Speaker 12:  sick hat,

281
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:48,405
Speaker 4:  So I was like let me try that where I'm not doing anything with the item.

282
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:51,285
Speaker 4:  So a maim mushroom chocolate video.

283
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:56,045
Speaker 5:  We don't love that these mushroom chocolates came, the

284
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:59,445
Speaker 5:  tin came open. But yeah,

285
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:04,285
Speaker 5:  they also be warned they will not get you high. Not

286
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:07,205
Speaker 5:  fun mushrooms just focus on energy mushrooms.

287
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,525
Speaker 4:  That has gotten me $3 and 45 cents

288
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:12,205
Speaker 1:  Killing it. Did anybody buy it?

289
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:16,365
Speaker 4:  No of course. No nobody. Nobody has purchased anything from me. So

290
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:20,285
Speaker 1:  You've sold nothing. Nothing to anyone. Nothing. But you're still making

291
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:22,765
Speaker 1:  money. Yeah, that's The future right there. I

292
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,885
Speaker 4:  Think that means I'm doing well but also

293
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:28,045
Speaker 1:  Perfectly low stakes 'cause nobody actually bought anything so nobody can

294
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:29,365
Speaker 1:  blame you for anything. Yeah

295
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:33,005
Speaker 4:  Totally. Another thing is like there's no way to add music. So

296
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:37,125
Speaker 4:  all of these are like silent, it's very like unsettling kind of. Oh

297
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:37,725
Speaker 1:  That's true.

298
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:41,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah it's really weird. Some people sometimes sneak music in like maybe they

299
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:45,005
Speaker 4:  recorded it in TikTok and then re-uploaded it but for the most part these

300
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,605
Speaker 4:  are like very like you can hear people breathing

301
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:51,085
Speaker 1:  Well. Yeah. So this is one of the things I keep wondering as you're talking

302
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:54,845
Speaker 1:  about this, which is I think about these kinds of videos as compared to

303
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:58,765
Speaker 1:  product placement stuff you see on Instagram or TikTok. And so for me, like

304
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:02,445
Speaker 1:  if I'm a brand, if I'm Kodak trying to sell a printer, why on earth

305
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:03,765
Speaker 1:  would I want to be on Flip?

306
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:08,085
Speaker 4:  That is such a good question because the brands get no control

307
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:11,805
Speaker 4:  over these videos. There's no review process that happens like with other

308
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:15,125
Speaker 4:  influencer content where brands are looking at it, editing it,

309
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:18,765
Speaker 4:  sending it back, accepting it like I am just some

310
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:23,085
Speaker 4:  rando making videos about your product. And that is where it

311
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:26,885
Speaker 4:  kind of gets into stickier, weirder

312
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:30,645
Speaker 4:  places. There's videos on Flip that if I were the brand I

313
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,165
Speaker 4:  probably would not want to exist.

314
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:33,325
Speaker 1:  Like gimme an example,

315
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:37,285
Speaker 4:  The funniest one that kind of came up really soon after I indicated that

316
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:40,605
Speaker 4:  I wanted to see men's fashion content. There was a video

317
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:45,205
Speaker 4:  with a man in shorts and

318
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:49,285
Speaker 4:  he and his friends are laughing and cackling about

319
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:52,845
Speaker 4:  the video that he is making and I think we should just roll the clip 'cause

320
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:54,925
Speaker 4:  I'm not going to try to repeat it.

321
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,325
Speaker 13:  Reveal these shorts all around comfort.

322
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:02,405
Speaker 13:  Incredible. Especially on the ball sack. Great

323
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:06,405
Speaker 13:  flexibility. I really like the way you can see just the outline of my

324
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,925
Speaker 13:  fucking balls just, just right there

325
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:14,405
Speaker 1:  Somewhere. Everyone who works in brand safety is just sobbing

326
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:16,445
Speaker 1:  into their phone right now. That's

327
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:17,485
Speaker 4:  Not even the worst one.

328
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:22,605
Speaker 4:  There was another one where the review is for socks

329
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,285
Speaker 4:  and the guys' feet are up on a coffee table.

330
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:30,685
Speaker 14:  Yo, what is up you guys? It's me with

331
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:33,885
Speaker 14:  my first flip review. I'm reviewing these

332
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:38,325
Speaker 14:  socks that I just got. First impressions, pretty

333
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:40,845
Speaker 14:  comfortable, nice soft touch to him.

334
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:45,085
Speaker 4:  If, you listen to it, it's fine. But what you do not see unless you're watching

335
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:49,045
Speaker 4:  the video is that around, first of all in front of his socks, his feet

336
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,925
Speaker 4:  is a bong that is like two feet tall and then

337
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:57,245
Speaker 4:  surrounding the bong and on the coffee table are dozens of Whippet canisters.

338
00:20:57,615 --> 00:21:01,605
Speaker 4:  Which yeah, if I'm the company that makes a socks a company which I did

339
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:05,405
Speaker 4:  reach out to and they didn't get back to me, I would be like please don't

340
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:08,605
Speaker 4:  do this. Yeah, I'm paying money, I'm paying money Every time someone makes

341
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:12,045
Speaker 4:  a purchase off this video, the brand safety is non-existent.

342
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:12,765
Speaker 4:  Well

343
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:15,965
Speaker 1:  And and that brings up I would say even like the slightly higher stakes version

344
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,885
Speaker 1:  of like content moderation stuff, right? Because if you're trying

345
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:23,445
Speaker 1:  to sell me something there's going to be an element of like life

346
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:27,045
Speaker 1:  recommendation that you have to do. But if you're doing it surrounded by

347
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:30,525
Speaker 1:  cans of whippets you have a real like genuine content

348
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:33,965
Speaker 1:  moderation problem that is more than just making the advertisers happy. Like

349
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:37,325
Speaker 1:  obviously TikTok has been through this, Instagram has been through this.

350
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:41,205
Speaker 1:  Everybody at any scale doing social stuff, shopping or otherwise goes

351
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:44,605
Speaker 1:  through content moderation stuff. Is flip doing content

352
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:48,125
Speaker 1:  moderation or are they as blase about everything as they seem to be about

353
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:48,845
Speaker 1:  these videos?

354
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:53,525
Speaker 4:  So I asked the flip CEO about this and his

355
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:57,805
Speaker 4:  response was they have a team of seven or eight content moderators

356
00:21:58,345 --> 00:22:02,285
Speaker 4:  or working at least on that side and their main thing that they're

357
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:05,885
Speaker 4:  looking for is like abusive content, hateful stuff.

358
00:22:06,435 --> 00:22:10,045
Speaker 15:  When something is escalated, when a report is escalating is is checked by

359
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:13,445
Speaker 15:  a human being but 70% of it is managed with machine learning.

360
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:17,245
Speaker 4:  But other than that they like the unvarnished sort of

361
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:21,405
Speaker 4:  average people doing stuff vibe. They don't

362
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:25,325
Speaker 4:  seem too concerned with like this idea of brand safety. They

363
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:28,765
Speaker 4:  also, you know like kind of like the trolley videos.

364
00:22:29,405 --> 00:22:33,325
Speaker 15:  I generally believe the influencer ecosystem of selling you

365
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:37,165
Speaker 15:  stuff is not something that's going on the way up.

366
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:41,045
Speaker 15:  I think there is a real ache for any realness

367
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:45,005
Speaker 15:  online, like anything that is real and not scripted

368
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:47,205
Speaker 15:  and not like filtered a thousand times.

369
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:51,005
Speaker 4:  They say that most people if they're going to troll do it in their first

370
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:53,885
Speaker 4:  video and then don't go on to like make that their entire account. I would

371
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:58,125
Speaker 4:  like disagree. I've definitely seen people who their entire thing is sort

372
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,125
Speaker 4:  of wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Like this is so stupid that we're doing this

373
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:04,445
Speaker 4:  but we're gonna do it anyway. It's something of the wild wild west where

374
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:07,925
Speaker 4:  people are just making money, you know,

375
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:11,765
Speaker 4:  producing the stuff that is like so low effort and and very unserious.

376
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:16,205
Speaker 1:  Do you buy the idea that that authenticity can scale

377
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:20,165
Speaker 1:  in this way? I mean I think we've seen over and over that once you introduce

378
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:24,565
Speaker 1:  not you know, pennies and nickels and dollars but like real make a

379
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:28,325
Speaker 1:  living kind of money to any kind of platform like this,

380
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:32,525
Speaker 1:  it changes you and I have both covered a million apps that come out and

381
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:35,565
Speaker 1:  are like we're the one that's real and then they get popular and they stop

382
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:37,965
Speaker 1:  being real and then another one comes out and it's like well we're the one

383
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:41,645
Speaker 1:  that's real and I wonder if it's possible. Do you think

384
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:45,405
Speaker 1:  Flip can grow the way it wants to and still feel like this?

385
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:49,805
Speaker 4:  I think right now it's in this sort of era of Gold Rush where it has all

386
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:53,325
Speaker 4:  this investor money just funding people joining

387
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:57,085
Speaker 4:  but Flip does not exist unless people are actually making purchases. So

388
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:00,885
Speaker 4:  let's say like everything is trash and nobody buys anything on Flip,

389
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:04,765
Speaker 4:  eventually that will collapse because the company is not

390
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:08,805
Speaker 4:  bringing anything in. Why would people make videos for stuff if

391
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:12,565
Speaker 4:  they're not buying anything, right? Like you can't So I think that this

392
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:16,525
Speaker 4:  idea of authenticity is, it's a pretty limited view

393
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:20,445
Speaker 4:  of what that looks like. I don't really need to go on

394
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:24,205
Speaker 4:  an app to see what my friends think about products, right? I can just text

395
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:27,645
Speaker 4:  them, I can just ask them if they like something, even if I saw them

396
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:31,005
Speaker 4:  make a video about a product, who's to say that I would buy it from them.

397
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:34,565
Speaker 4:  I might just like go to the site and see if there's a discount or buy it

398
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:38,325
Speaker 4:  somewhere else. So I think this idea that they can corral all of your shopping

399
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:41,725
Speaker 4:  habits and sort of review culture

400
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:44,845
Speaker 4:  into one place is I would say it's a pipe dream.

401
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:49,085
Speaker 1:  I agree with all of that in theory and yet there is part of me that says

402
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:52,805
Speaker 1:  maybe what Flip is doing, and this is this is kind of where my like

403
00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:56,525
Speaker 1:  Galaxy Brain feelings you take on all of this goes is that maybe what Flip

404
00:24:56,525 --> 00:25:00,205
Speaker 1:  is doing is just short cutting and end running

405
00:25:00,395 --> 00:25:04,045
Speaker 1:  this process that Instagram and TikTok and all the other platforms are already

406
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:07,325
Speaker 1:  on. I mean we've talked about on this show and you've been, you've been writing

407
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:11,045
Speaker 1:  about the overwhelming influx of the TikTok shop

408
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:14,965
Speaker 1:  onto TikTok and now If you want to be popular on TikTok. The single

409
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:18,125
Speaker 1:  quickest way to get there is to be selling something and now it feels like

410
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,445
Speaker 1:  everything you see on TikTok, somebody is selling you something and that's

411
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:23,765
Speaker 1:  where the business is going. That's where a lot of this stuff is going and

412
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:27,685
Speaker 1:  it's also just becoming sort of accepted. I think like

413
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:31,565
Speaker 1:  years ago it would've felt gross for people to be nakedly

414
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:34,245
Speaker 1:  selling you stuff like this online and now it's just kind of what it is.

415
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,525
Speaker 1:  So maybe flip is just skipping to the last step

416
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,805
Speaker 1:  and it's gonna be right because shopping is the end stage of all of this

417
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:46,005
Speaker 1:  anyway. Like is there a version of this where Flip is just gonna like win

418
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:49,565
Speaker 1:  because it threw out all the other pretend stuff and just did the thing that

419
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:50,965
Speaker 1:  actually makes the money? Well

420
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:54,325
Speaker 4:  I think one of the reasons I find Flip very compelling and why I've spent

421
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:57,925
Speaker 4:  again hours on the app is that it does feel like

422
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:02,165
Speaker 4:  sort of the evolution of short form video that

423
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:06,205
Speaker 4:  we are already seeing hints of like that this is the direction even apps

424
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:09,685
Speaker 4:  like TikTok are going where I don't know that Flip will be the one that wins

425
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:13,005
Speaker 4:  in the end, but it is capturing and

426
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:17,485
Speaker 4:  sort of trying to monetize what TikTok also is

427
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:21,445
Speaker 4:  trying to do. If you have maybe been, you know on TikTok in

428
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:24,845
Speaker 4:  the recent, in the last like week or so you've probably seen like at the

429
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:28,645
Speaker 4:  end of videos there will be a popup that says Shop

430
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:32,565
Speaker 4:  more shoes or Shop more men's

431
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:36,645
Speaker 4:  coats on TikTok shop and it takes you to TikTok shop and gives

432
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:40,525
Speaker 4:  you a list of products that in my experience I wrote about

433
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:44,005
Speaker 4:  this as well in my experience have nothing to do with the product that it

434
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:47,925
Speaker 4:  says it wants you to shop for but the goal is to get you

435
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:51,885
Speaker 4:  on to shop on the shop platform and the videos that these prompts

436
00:26:51,885 --> 00:26:55,165
Speaker 4:  are being added to are not even nakedly

437
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:59,165
Speaker 4:  promotional. They're talking about something and TikTok

438
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:02,645
Speaker 4:  picks up what is in that video and tries to convert that into a purchase.

439
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:06,765
Speaker 4:  And so the flip platform is like that if it

440
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:07,845
Speaker 4:  drops a pretext

441
00:27:07,845 --> 00:27:09,805
Speaker 1:  Right? It's almost more honest in a way.

442
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:13,885
Speaker 4:  It is completely. And we already know that this is really the direction

443
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:17,085
Speaker 4:  that TikTok wants to go in and that it is seriously trying to ramp up its

444
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:20,845
Speaker 4:  shopping business in the United States this year. So it was giving

445
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:25,245
Speaker 4:  all these crazy promotional deals to merchants to try to get them onto TikTok

446
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:28,445
Speaker 4:  shop. It was doing sort of the Ali Express

447
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:32,565
Speaker 4:  Shian Temu thing of you know, 99% off

448
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:36,565
Speaker 4:  or free item just pay shipping, like whatever these kind of crazy

449
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:39,925
Speaker 4:  good, too good to be true deals to get people to buy things on

450
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:44,205
Speaker 4:  TikTok shop. The parallels with Flip are very obvious. It feels like

451
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,885
Speaker 4:  Flip is just that but more focused where

452
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:51,725
Speaker 4:  they just stop pretending that it's about anything other than actually making,

453
00:27:51,825 --> 00:27:55,325
Speaker 4:  making sales and getting that affiliate money. Getting merchants on onto

454
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:58,685
Speaker 4:  the platform. I've observed this, I don't know David if you've seen this

455
00:27:58,685 --> 00:28:02,405
Speaker 4:  too with like your favorite creators who start out educational, you know,

456
00:28:02,405 --> 00:28:06,325
Speaker 4:  start out making educational content, start out vlogging or not

457
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:09,925
Speaker 4:  monetizing their content in any way in particular, but then very quickly

458
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:13,925
Speaker 4:  when the opportunity presents itself they jump to doing the sponsored content.

459
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:17,685
Speaker 4:  Yep. Or the, the ads and that bridge

460
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:22,085
Speaker 4:  is like a stone's throw, you know, it is so easy to

461
00:28:22,085 --> 00:28:25,925
Speaker 4:  switch into that mode If you want and there are a lot of people who

462
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:29,805
Speaker 4:  hold down normal jobs and then also are making, you know, getting brand deals

463
00:28:29,805 --> 00:28:33,405
Speaker 4:  and making tiktoks and making sponsored content. So this idea of

464
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:37,045
Speaker 4:  like influencer being a separate category

465
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:41,165
Speaker 4:  is I think increasingly becoming less true. And the whole thing about Flip

466
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:44,885
Speaker 4:  is that you see non influencers make this content

467
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:48,925
Speaker 4:  and potentially benefit and profit from it and they want you to do that.

468
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:52,325
Speaker 4:  They want you to create this new side hustle that maybe might

469
00:28:52,585 --> 00:28:56,485
Speaker 4:  amount to, you know, 20 bucks in a in a couple weeks, which is,

470
00:28:56,565 --> 00:29:00,205
Speaker 4:  I haven't even hit that point and I've been trying so hard on flip and I

471
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,685
Speaker 4:  still have only made like $14 and I can't even cash it out. I cannot even

472
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:07,525
Speaker 4:  cash out my money because I need to get to 20. So yeah, it's very sad and

473
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:10,325
Speaker 4:  feels like stolen labor on my part but

474
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:15,285
Speaker 4:  this vision that it presents is that all of your activities

475
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:19,205
Speaker 4:  online, all of your purchases, maybe you can monetize them. What if, what

476
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:19,645
Speaker 4:  If you could.

477
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:23,885
Speaker 1:  Right. And it makes me wonder if Flip looks more

478
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:27,685
Speaker 1:  like The future of Amazon or The future of

479
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:32,125
Speaker 1:  social networking because I think to me the idea that TikTok and

480
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:35,845
Speaker 1:  Instagram and sort of the places we used to go to like connect and find stuff

481
00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:39,685
Speaker 1:  we liked online are just rapidly becoming shopping malls

482
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:43,565
Speaker 1:  is true and also like deeply bleak and kind of

483
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:47,365
Speaker 1:  dystopian in a way. But the idea that the way I shop on Amazon

484
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:51,365
Speaker 1:  is essentially going to be sort of overrun by middlemen

485
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:55,165
Speaker 1:  who are like real people, quote unquote real people who are talking

486
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:58,125
Speaker 1:  about the products. That doesn't strike me as like more or less

487
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:02,925
Speaker 1:  bad in the world. It just seems like kind of a future of

488
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:06,445
Speaker 1:  shopping that is already really real in places like China where like live

489
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:09,125
Speaker 1:  streaming shopping has been a huge business for a really long time. And So

490
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,965
Speaker 1:  I wonder, like as you talk to folks that flip and use the platform, like

491
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:15,645
Speaker 1:  does it feel more like social or more like shopping over time?

492
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:20,165
Speaker 4:  That's a good question because so much of short form video like TikTok was

493
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:22,605
Speaker 4:  already about finding things to buy. Yeah,

494
00:30:22,605 --> 00:30:22,885
Speaker 1:  Totally.

495
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:26,925
Speaker 4:  I have been like beating this drum for a long time, especially with

496
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:31,045
Speaker 4:  people in my age group women Gen Z, right? Like

497
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:34,845
Speaker 4:  they go to TikTok for recommendations. They do and they jump off the app

498
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:38,765
Speaker 4:  then buy the thing. Often it sells out. Sometimes it's like in the

499
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:41,605
Speaker 4:  New York Times style section or whatever, gets all these writeups of the,

500
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:44,965
Speaker 4:  about this viral product and TikTok is making no money from that. So

501
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:49,285
Speaker 4:  obviously they want in on this. And Flip is sort of just like

502
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:53,045
Speaker 4:  systematizing this and automating that in a way that TikTok I think is really

503
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:56,725
Speaker 4:  trying to flip's footprint is obviously way smaller than TikTok,

504
00:30:56,825 --> 00:31:00,765
Speaker 4:  but you know, the point stands and in terms of like, I don't know, does

505
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:04,325
Speaker 4:  it feel better or worse? I think it's

506
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:07,845
Speaker 4:  interesting that we are in an era of hyper

507
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:10,965
Speaker 4:  recommendations and we still need someone to tell us what to do. That we

508
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:14,725
Speaker 4:  still need someone to tell us what is good and what is bad and what we should

509
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:18,525
Speaker 4:  buy. I saw like the explosion of gift guides on TikTok this year more than

510
00:31:18,525 --> 00:31:22,365
Speaker 4:  other years, which I find fascinating when presumably our

511
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:26,565
Speaker 4:  for you algorithm should be like an endless stream of

512
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:30,325
Speaker 4:  gifts or things that we might be interested in. Things that, you know, the

513
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:33,765
Speaker 4:  data shows that we might, we might purchase or we might watch or we might

514
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:37,645
Speaker 4:  like or save. And so this idea that like we still want

515
00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:41,485
Speaker 4:  newsletters with recommendations, we still want friends telling us things.

516
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:45,805
Speaker 4:  It tells me that there's, there's something that is not

517
00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:49,565
Speaker 4:  quite there with like the algorithmic recommendations. And

518
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:53,325
Speaker 4:  is it good that all of us become salespeople?

519
00:31:54,235 --> 00:31:58,125
Speaker 4:  Like, no, is that brave of me to say, I don't know. That feels

520
00:31:58,225 --> 00:32:02,045
Speaker 4:  bad. That feels bad. And but I also get the other point of

521
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,965
Speaker 4:  like If, you are posting something on TikTok and it's going to be catapulting

522
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,885
Speaker 4:  the viewer to TikTok shop anyway. Why not try to get

523
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:13,325
Speaker 4:  a cut of it? Because right now as it stands, the people who have that TikTok

524
00:32:13,325 --> 00:32:17,245
Speaker 4:  shop, you know, shop more shoes button, as far as I

525
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:20,805
Speaker 4:  know, they're not getting a cut of that. So it makes me think like, why would

526
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,485
Speaker 4:  I make any content if it's just going to be a sort of portal

527
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:27,045
Speaker 4:  for TikTok to make more money? Totally.

528
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,885
Speaker 1:  No, I I think that's right and I think in, in a funny way, you just sort

529
00:32:29,885 --> 00:32:33,445
Speaker 1:  of encapsulated like a central tension of The internet right now that we

530
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:36,445
Speaker 1:  are gonna have to spend a lot more time talking about. But for now, before

531
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:39,845
Speaker 1:  I let you go, give me the, the state of the Mia flip business.

532
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:43,245
Speaker 1:  You said you've made like 14 bucks. Tell me, I want, I wanna know the money,

533
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:47,165
Speaker 1:  I wanna know the views, I wanna know how quickly you are becoming a

534
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:47,965
Speaker 1:  mogul on flip.

535
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:52,325
Speaker 4:  I have to say that it's, it's not going as successfully as I

536
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:55,325
Speaker 4:  would've hoped. Also, the videos that I spent the most time on have done

537
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:58,325
Speaker 4:  the worst, which is fascinating. There's

538
00:32:58,325 --> 00:32:59,005
Speaker 1:  A life lesson there.

539
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:02,925
Speaker 4:  It's a life lesson. It's sad too because a lot of the products that I bought,

540
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:07,005
Speaker 4:  like I probably won't end up doing much with, I, I tried

541
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:10,525
Speaker 4:  to buy some perishable things. So like I bought coffee beans, which I will

542
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:14,485
Speaker 4:  drink coffee eventually. I bought candles that I actually am obsessed

543
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:18,005
Speaker 4:  with that I purchased before I was on Flip and I was like, oh, they're on

544
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:21,645
Speaker 4:  Flip too. So I bought like four of those candles. Nice. So I'm

545
00:33:21,645 --> 00:33:25,525
Speaker 4:  stocked but I will not quit my job at The

546
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:29,125
Speaker 4:  Verge dot com anytime soon. Unless something crazy happens to my

547
00:33:29,315 --> 00:33:31,605
Speaker 4:  flip content, then I then I'm out. Once

548
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:33,845
Speaker 1:  You hit 20 bucks and you can cash out, it's all over.

549
00:33:34,185 --> 00:33:36,445
Speaker 4:  I'm taking my money and running. Exactly. Love

550
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,525
Speaker 1:  It. Mia. Thank you. Appreciate it as always.

551
00:33:38,665 --> 00:33:40,045
Speaker 4:  Thanks David. This was so fun.

552
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:43,605
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna talk cameras. We'll

553
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:43,965
Speaker 1:  be right back.

554
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:47,115
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Last week Fujifilm announced the X 106,

555
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:50,915
Speaker 1:  which is its newest camera. Normally in 2024. A new camera

556
00:36:51,065 --> 00:36:54,915
Speaker 1:  doesn't qualify as a culture shaking event, but this one

557
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:58,435
Speaker 1:  kind of did the X 105. The last model of this camera

558
00:36:58,895 --> 00:37:02,835
Speaker 1:  became kind of a viral sensation over the last few years to the point where

559
00:37:02,835 --> 00:37:06,675
Speaker 1:  you basically couldn't get your hands on one, even If you wanted to even

560
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:09,555
Speaker 1:  If you wanted to spend the well over a thousand dollars that it would cost

561
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:13,115
Speaker 1:  you. This new model is apparently going to be easier to get your hands on

562
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:17,195
Speaker 1:  and also comes with some upgrades. But fundamentally it's still an X 100

563
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:20,875
Speaker 1:  oh and it's a little more expensive to help me figure out why this camera

564
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:24,555
Speaker 1:  matters so much and whether the new one is a worthy upgrades. The

565
00:37:24,635 --> 00:37:27,755
Speaker 1:  Internet's favorite camera, I grabbed two members of the verges video team

566
00:37:27,935 --> 00:37:31,715
Speaker 1:  and two of our most dedicated camera nerds. Verin Pavich

567
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:34,835
Speaker 1:  and Becca Farsace Verin, welcome to the show. Oh

568
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:35,555
Speaker 18:  My God. Hello

569
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,915
Speaker 1:  Becca. Hello. Hello my camera people. This is very exciting.

570
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:43,715
Speaker 1:  I'm glad to have you here. We never get to talk about dedicated cameras

571
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:47,835
Speaker 1:  on The Vergecast because who cares? But now we get to because people care.

572
00:37:47,905 --> 00:37:51,795
Speaker 1:  This is very exciting. Boy do they care? They super care. Yeah, right.

573
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,755
Speaker 1:  So I wanna get it? That's like mostly what I wanna talk about is like the,

574
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:58,315
Speaker 1:  the cultural phenomenon of this camera. But I feel like we should

575
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:01,475
Speaker 1:  educate people on a little bit of, of Fujifilm

576
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:05,915
Speaker 1:  history here to start. So Verin, maybe let's start with you 'cause

577
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:09,755
Speaker 1:  I think you've been using the X 100 line of cameras for

578
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:13,635
Speaker 1:  a very long time. So like take me back to the, the beginning of the X

579
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:17,435
Speaker 1:  100. What is this camera like? What's its deal? Even from the very

580
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:17,715
Speaker 1:  beginning,

581
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,315
Speaker 18:  So I, someone actually asked me yesterday, they used Fuji and I went back

582
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:25,235
Speaker 18:  to like see when I started and it was exactly a 10 years ago. Oh nice.

583
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:29,355
Speaker 18:  When I bought the X 100 T, which is the

584
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:33,195
Speaker 18:  third one, now it's six and people are opinionated. It is a

585
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:36,965
Speaker 18:  point and shoot fixed lens 23 millimeter F two

586
00:38:37,225 --> 00:38:40,685
Speaker 18:  on, which is an equivalent to 35 millimeter camera that just

587
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:44,885
Speaker 18:  does a lot of things, right? Like people love it is the fact that it

588
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:48,565
Speaker 18:  has like film simulations that make your JPEG look amazing

589
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:52,405
Speaker 18:  for a lot of people and myself included, it's been like the the perfect

590
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:56,445
Speaker 18:  beat camera. Like I want a digital camera that is a small footprint that

591
00:38:56,445 --> 00:39:00,245
Speaker 18:  I can bring everywhere and get good results with. And that's kind of it.

592
00:39:00,265 --> 00:39:03,925
Speaker 18:  And it was my entry into Fuji and at that point, like I saw this camera,

593
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:07,365
Speaker 18:  I played around with it and I was like, oh wow, this is what a modern camera

594
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,845
Speaker 18:  looks like and a retro body. I got really excited by like the, the

595
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:14,765
Speaker 18:  viewfinder and the built-in nds and all these little things

596
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:16,485
Speaker 18:  that make it like very useful.

597
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:20,685
Speaker 19:  But I, I don't think it's just that it produces good results. I think

598
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:24,445
Speaker 19:  what's actually more important is that you look cool doing it because

599
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,245
Speaker 19:  there's many point and shoot cameras like this, like Ricoh makes one

600
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:31,325
Speaker 19:  and I mean If you have a lot of money like, but like the whole idea is that

601
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:35,205
Speaker 19:  like, this looks really cool. It's a, it's a price point that some people

602
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:39,125
Speaker 19:  can digest easily without knowing too much about cameras. And then you also

603
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:42,085
Speaker 19:  have the added bonus of sometimes it can produce good results if you know

604
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:42,445
Speaker 19:  what you're doing.

605
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,965
Speaker 1:  Balance those two sides of it for me. 'cause I think there is something to

606
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:50,325
Speaker 1:  the fact that this is just a great looking camera and has been for a long

607
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:54,125
Speaker 1:  time and it started to be everywhere. you know people are doing like street

608
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,245
Speaker 1:  photography and like the blogging era and everybody was excited about those

609
00:39:57,245 --> 00:40:01,165
Speaker 1:  cameras for that. But there is also something to what you're saying, ve

610
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,925
Speaker 1:  and I, somebody described it to me at one point as like it is the perfect

611
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:07,925
Speaker 1:  middle between A-D-S-L-R and a smartphone where it's, you get

612
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:11,525
Speaker 1:  some controls but fundamentally you can just turn the thing on, point it

613
00:40:11,525 --> 00:40:14,725
Speaker 1:  at something, shoot and trust that it will do something spectacular

614
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:18,925
Speaker 1:  for you. So like for you guys as people who do this like professionally,

615
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:22,445
Speaker 1:  do you buy this because it's cool over another sort of

616
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:26,125
Speaker 1:  equivalently spect equivalently priced camera or is there something

617
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:29,325
Speaker 1:  about the X 100 that is special as a camera?

618
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:31,405
Speaker 19:  I can't wait to hear Vern's answer.

619
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:34,645
Speaker 18:  I will say there is something very special about this camera.

620
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:35,765
Speaker 19:  There it is.

621
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:39,365
Speaker 18:  I will say that much. There it is. You won the bed if that was your bed.

622
00:40:39,615 --> 00:40:42,925
Speaker 19:  Bingo. But I would buy this camera as a hobby camera.

623
00:40:43,435 --> 00:40:47,245
Speaker 19:  Like this is what I take with me because it's fun to use.

624
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:50,765
Speaker 19:  It has like all, I have it right here. It has like all of these dials and

625
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:53,805
Speaker 19:  it feels good in your hand. Although this front grip could be hella thicker,

626
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:57,645
Speaker 19:  which is why a lot of people buy a thumb grip for the back. It's just fun

627
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:00,925
Speaker 19:  to use and you get results that are better than a smartphone.

628
00:41:01,505 --> 00:41:05,405
Speaker 19:  But I wouldn't do professional work on this

629
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:08,845
Speaker 19:  because on a professional camera I want more control over my lenses

630
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:11,245
Speaker 19:  and I do want a full frame sensor.

631
00:41:11,715 --> 00:41:15,365
Speaker 18:  Yeah it is not like a camera that can do a lot.

632
00:41:15,825 --> 00:41:19,805
Speaker 18:  It has that perfect focal length for a lot of people. It has very good

633
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:23,525
Speaker 18:  video capabilities. But does it really need, I mean like

634
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:26,885
Speaker 18:  yeah it's nice to have and I guess in a world of like TikTok and Instagram

635
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:30,605
Speaker 18:  like reels like yeah it's good to have like good video as well. But

636
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:34,165
Speaker 18:  even like video capabilities, I always like never really cared about those

637
00:41:34,465 --> 00:41:38,285
Speaker 18:  on this camera. So it is like, it is very limiting in what it can

638
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:42,245
Speaker 18:  do actually as a camera. but it really exploded

639
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:44,765
Speaker 18:  in popularity in the last couple of years.

640
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:47,405
Speaker 1:  Yeah, no Vern, hold on. I'm not letting you off the hook for this though.

641
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,965
Speaker 1:  You love this thing. Thank you. Yeah, there this thing has like mythical

642
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:53,205
Speaker 1:  properties for you and I want you to explain why

643
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:57,205
Speaker 18:  I do love this camera. I do have a confession that I actually like sold

644
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:01,205
Speaker 18:  mine. What? Yes I did. 'cause I just knew that maybe

645
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:05,045
Speaker 18:  I will get whatever is coming and the pricing for it was still like, oh

646
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:07,925
Speaker 18:  yeah, you know what? I can, I can sell it for a decent amount of money.

647
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:12,005
Speaker 19:  Not only does Verin wanna get what's coming, but he saw the limited

648
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:15,725
Speaker 19:  edition. It was like I, I don't really want this camera, I want the one

649
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:19,645
Speaker 19:  that's only 1,900 and I don't know, 36 of 'em remain. I want that

650
00:42:19,645 --> 00:42:20,285
Speaker 19:  one. Love it.

651
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:24,405
Speaker 18:  Yes. Well I did spend my entire morning trying to get Eldon Ring collector's

652
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:28,285
Speaker 18:  edition and that failed. So you know, I have to like redeem myself with

653
00:42:28,285 --> 00:42:31,645
Speaker 18:  the Fuji X 106 limited edition.

654
00:42:32,065 --> 00:42:35,685
Speaker 18:  No, I mean I do love what Fuji is doing with like the film

655
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:39,325
Speaker 18:  simulations and everything. I make a lot of my own. I go through the,

656
00:42:39,505 --> 00:42:43,125
Speaker 18:  the websites that like give you recipes that you can use for the camera.

657
00:42:43,525 --> 00:42:47,365
Speaker 18:  I just love bringing it around. Like I'm an am the person who like wants

658
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:51,085
Speaker 18:  to bring a camera everywhere I go for the longest time that it used to be

659
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:55,005
Speaker 18:  like a five D for me, which is massive and really not like

660
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,445
Speaker 18:  a thing that you would wanna like carry around. So this was always like,

661
00:42:58,465 --> 00:43:01,725
Speaker 18:  oh I can bring this, it's a digital camera. I mainly film

662
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:05,845
Speaker 18:  still shooting digital. So there was a lot

663
00:43:06,135 --> 00:43:10,045
Speaker 18:  about it that just like, it does very well. But once I got my

664
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,765
Speaker 18:  first one, like the, the idea of like all the modern specs that it

665
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:17,605
Speaker 18:  actually had in it made me realize about like, oh

666
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:21,565
Speaker 18:  these cameras are just like super fun to just like use

667
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,085
Speaker 18:  and have a bunch in it that I like wasn't expecting.

668
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:27,725
Speaker 19:  Yeah. So it's like the joining of this is fun to use and I can also get

669
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:28,725
Speaker 19:  pretty good results with it.

670
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:32,845
Speaker 1:  And there is something too, having a camera this size that is

671
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:36,565
Speaker 1:  not scary to bring to parties. Like I have been places where Veen has

672
00:43:36,565 --> 00:43:40,485
Speaker 1:  busted out big giant cameras with you know, 18 to 200 lenses and they

673
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:44,245
Speaker 1:  freak people out. Whereas the X 100 is like that perfect size where

674
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:48,405
Speaker 1:  it sort of blends in in a way that other better cameras don't. And

675
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:50,285
Speaker 1:  it is like, it's a middle point that I think is very powerful.

676
00:43:50,725 --> 00:43:54,485
Speaker 19:  I saw on threads somebody was saying like this is the greatest camera to

677
00:43:54,485 --> 00:43:57,005
Speaker 19:  bring to concerts 'cause I know it won't get confiscated, it doesn't look

678
00:43:57,005 --> 00:44:00,805
Speaker 19:  professional enough for that. But I can get great results and like genius.

679
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:01,245
Speaker 19:  Yep.

680
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:05,325
Speaker 1:  Perfect explanation. I love that. So, but for like a decade this thing just

681
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:08,845
Speaker 1:  trundles along. It's a good camera, people like it, but it then in 2020

682
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:12,765
Speaker 1:  becomes like a cultural phenomenon. And I, I missed the

683
00:44:12,835 --> 00:44:15,765
Speaker 1:  origins of this. Like all of a sudden I feel like I turned around and everyone

684
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:19,565
Speaker 1:  was talking about it. But this is a TikTok thing, right? Like

685
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:22,405
Speaker 1:  Becca, how did this become such a thing on The internet

686
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:26,845
Speaker 19:  TikTok is a visual platform and folks saw this camera,

687
00:44:27,075 --> 00:44:30,925
Speaker 19:  they saw the results that some folks were getting and they're like, I want

688
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:34,605
Speaker 19:  that too. And like I was saying before, it has a price that

689
00:44:34,745 --> 00:44:38,605
Speaker 19:  is friendly to some folks. Not all, this is not a cheap camera

690
00:44:38,665 --> 00:44:42,645
Speaker 19:  by any means, but it's much cheaper than most muralist cameras

691
00:44:42,785 --> 00:44:45,405
Speaker 19:  or most cameras that produce similar results that are in, you know, into

692
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:48,325
Speaker 19:  the two thousands. And that's just for the body alone. This you get the

693
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:52,125
Speaker 19:  camera and the lens. And at the time I think it

694
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:55,565
Speaker 19:  was going for like, well before it blew up on TikTok, it was going for like

695
00:44:55,765 --> 00:44:58,285
Speaker 19:  $1,400 and then it blew up and so did the prices.

696
00:44:59,085 --> 00:45:03,005
Speaker 18:  Honestly it took me by surprise how many people would come to me asking

697
00:45:03,005 --> 00:45:06,885
Speaker 18:  me about this camera and I had no idea that it was blowing up on TikTok.

698
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:10,885
Speaker 18:  Hmm. Like I, I truly had no idea that it was like becoming so popular.

699
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:15,205
Speaker 18:  And soon after that, like my algorithm changed

700
00:45:15,565 --> 00:45:19,365
Speaker 18:  entirely and the only thing I can see is just like X 100 V photos and

701
00:45:19,365 --> 00:45:22,965
Speaker 18:  samples and not even like samples. Like my, my algorithms are like

702
00:45:23,475 --> 00:45:27,445
Speaker 18:  very much like photo video creators. Like I see a lot of samples

703
00:45:27,515 --> 00:45:31,005
Speaker 18:  with everything but the X 100 V was kind of like

704
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:34,765
Speaker 18:  just chilling there. It was like part of the set as well. And it was not

705
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:37,565
Speaker 18:  only about what it can do, but it was also very cool to have this camera.

706
00:45:38,075 --> 00:45:41,685
Speaker 18:  Like I do think that a lot of people now like do love the film

707
00:45:41,795 --> 00:45:45,565
Speaker 18:  look in general, but some people don't want to make film photos.

708
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:49,285
Speaker 18:  And this was kind of like, oh I can, I can have the best of both worlds.

709
00:45:49,675 --> 00:45:53,245
Speaker 19:  Yeah. If you'll allow me to talk about that for a second. The whole, the

710
00:45:53,245 --> 00:45:56,645
Speaker 19:  whole idea of having film photos without having to shoot film.

711
00:45:57,075 --> 00:46:00,565
Speaker 19:  Like I think a lot of folks swung to film because you can naturally get

712
00:46:00,605 --> 00:46:03,525
Speaker 19:  a really great baked in look but there's a lot of friction there with having

713
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:07,765
Speaker 19:  to drop it off at a lab and like kind of having to know what aperture

714
00:46:07,905 --> 00:46:08,125
Speaker 19:  is.

715
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:11,285
Speaker 1:  Plus then you have it on film and what the hell are you gonna do with film?

716
00:46:11,465 --> 00:46:14,365
Speaker 19:  You're gonna put it in a binder and you're never gonna look at it again.

717
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:17,885
Speaker 18:  Yeah. You have to scan it. How are you gonna scan it? Are you taking photos

718
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:21,725
Speaker 18:  or a scanner? Like there's a whole culture of like,

719
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:25,165
Speaker 18:  you know, subculture people like doing it and it's fantastic. And I think

720
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:28,685
Speaker 18:  in like, especially when we're like in the AI role of just like

721
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:32,685
Speaker 18:  generative images and now videos, like there is something about

722
00:46:32,705 --> 00:46:36,685
Speaker 18:  the tangibility of film that people are like really going after again.

723
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:37,245
Speaker 18:  Oh

724
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:41,165
Speaker 19:  Yeah, I love it. but it is filled with friction. I'll say it film is a

725
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,965
Speaker 19:  pain in the ass and that's what I love about it. But this can give you

726
00:46:45,395 --> 00:46:48,765
Speaker 19:  film like it's, it's the closest digital camera that can naturally give

727
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:52,565
Speaker 19:  you film-like results without having to do anything with film.

728
00:46:53,055 --> 00:46:55,405
Speaker 1:  Becca, dig into that a little bit for me. 'cause people do talk a lot about

729
00:46:55,405 --> 00:46:59,125
Speaker 1:  the film simulation stuff and I think I have

730
00:46:59,355 --> 00:47:03,325
Speaker 1:  been conditioned over the years to not trust any built-in

731
00:47:03,325 --> 00:47:06,085
Speaker 1:  setting inside of a camera because they'll just screw up your photos and

732
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:08,765
Speaker 1:  everybody's like, just do it in post, fix it on your computer. You can make

733
00:47:08,765 --> 00:47:11,245
Speaker 1:  it look like anything you want. There's tons of good software. You, you should

734
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,925
Speaker 1:  shoot the rawest cleanest thing outta the camera that you should.

735
00:47:15,185 --> 00:47:18,485
Speaker 1:  But on the X 100 people buy into these film

736
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:22,365
Speaker 1:  simulation things, right? Like what is, what is Fuji doing here that is different?

737
00:47:23,065 --> 00:47:27,005
Speaker 19:  So David ML made an incredible video for the studio about

738
00:47:27,785 --> 00:47:31,205
Speaker 19:  why and how Fujifilm is perfectly poised to make this camera.

739
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:35,645
Speaker 19:  And the guts of that video is that they have been creating film

740
00:47:36,105 --> 00:47:40,085
Speaker 19:  for, I mean most of their history. And so they have

741
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:43,805
Speaker 19:  a lot of great color scientists who know how to make great

742
00:47:43,865 --> 00:47:47,685
Speaker 19:  colors and they just baked that into this camera. And that's something that,

743
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:51,605
Speaker 19:  I mean if Kodak was still around, maybe they could do it, but nobody else

744
00:47:52,465 --> 00:47:56,045
Speaker 19:  has that background knowledge on color science. And so there's a level of

745
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:59,725
Speaker 19:  trust that folks have in this camera and the colors that it produces that

746
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:03,085
Speaker 19:  they don't have in other companies cameras. And again, go watch David's

747
00:48:03,085 --> 00:48:06,925
Speaker 19:  video. It is excellent. And he also speaks about shooting

748
00:48:07,105 --> 00:48:10,365
Speaker 19:  raw versus jpeg and makes a great analogy to

749
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:14,565
Speaker 19:  clay and you gotta go watch that video. But the long short of it is that

750
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:18,445
Speaker 19:  the colors that this camera produces are actually really good and more

751
00:48:18,445 --> 00:48:22,045
Speaker 19:  importantly they're unique to this system, whereas in most manufacturers

752
00:48:22,225 --> 00:48:25,565
Speaker 19:  are just creating color profiles that are pleasing to the most amount of

753
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:25,765
Speaker 19:  people.

754
00:48:26,305 --> 00:48:29,805
Speaker 1:  Got it. Okay. So let's talk about the, the X 106 itself.

755
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:34,045
Speaker 1:  This thing has been, I would say more hotly awaited than just

756
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:37,925
Speaker 1:  about any camera I can think of. I admittedly am not in like the

757
00:48:37,925 --> 00:48:41,685
Speaker 1:  professional camera world, So, I, don't know if they're like weird Sony

758
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,605
Speaker 1:  lenses that are getting just as much press, but like people have been talking

759
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:48,005
Speaker 1:  about it waiting for this camera for a very long time. Like there, there

760
00:48:48,005 --> 00:48:51,765
Speaker 1:  were leaks about every piece of it, which I don't remember happening for

761
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:55,405
Speaker 1:  a camera in a really long time. What is different from a hardware

762
00:48:55,405 --> 00:48:58,765
Speaker 1:  perspective about the camera this time? Becca, you have one. What are kind

763
00:48:58,765 --> 00:49:00,925
Speaker 1:  of the big upgrades for this generation?

764
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,045
Speaker 19:  You do have 40 megapixels as opposed to 26

765
00:49:05,135 --> 00:49:08,965
Speaker 19:  megapixels on the V. The LCD allows 15 degrees more

766
00:49:09,075 --> 00:49:12,205
Speaker 19:  tilt, but otherwise it's pretty much the same

767
00:49:12,745 --> 00:49:15,725
Speaker 19:  camera. There's one more thing that's very important. you know, how have

768
00:49:15,725 --> 00:49:19,525
Speaker 19:  InBody image stabilization so you can basically shoot at

769
00:49:19,805 --> 00:49:22,565
Speaker 19:  lower shutter speeds and still get crisp photos.

770
00:49:23,155 --> 00:49:27,045
Speaker 1:  That feels fine. Were people clamoring for anything new and

771
00:49:27,045 --> 00:49:28,925
Speaker 1:  huge in the hardware? It doesn't sound like they were,

772
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:32,845
Speaker 19:  I think what's a bigger deal about this camera though is there was a lot

773
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:36,725
Speaker 19:  of scarcity in the v hmm. And now they're producing this

774
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:40,085
Speaker 19:  camera in China as opposed to Japan, which some folks aren't stoked about,

775
00:49:40,425 --> 00:49:44,085
Speaker 19:  but Fujifilm is promising that they will have more available to folks

776
00:49:44,465 --> 00:49:47,045
Speaker 19:  and that's just good news for a lot of people who couldn't get their hands

777
00:49:47,145 --> 00:49:48,365
Speaker 19:  on an X 100 V.

778
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:52,645
Speaker 1:  Yeah. How scarce was it? E everything got kind of weird during the pandemic

779
00:49:52,645 --> 00:49:56,365
Speaker 1:  trying to buy stuff, but like how rare did the X 100

780
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:57,285
Speaker 1:  V actually become?

781
00:49:57,675 --> 00:50:00,965
Speaker 18:  Yeah, I think like after the pandemic it was just like extremely hard to

782
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:04,925
Speaker 18:  get and like I wanted to get one and it just like never made

783
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:08,965
Speaker 18:  sense. Like the prices were just like insane. And

784
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:12,725
Speaker 18:  I think this was like one of the last few Fuji cameras

785
00:50:12,745 --> 00:50:16,685
Speaker 18:  before they switched their factories. So I think like it was

786
00:50:16,685 --> 00:50:20,565
Speaker 18:  the X 100 V and then like X PRO three. I think the X PRO

787
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:24,485
Speaker 18:  three was like the last one made in Japan and then they switched to China.

788
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:28,405
Speaker 18:  Probably did not help with just like trying to get those orders out. And

789
00:50:28,405 --> 00:50:31,845
Speaker 18:  at one point Fuji was just like we, we we're not accept

790
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:35,445
Speaker 18:  accepting any more orders. So there's the other side of the argument that

791
00:50:35,445 --> 00:50:39,245
Speaker 18:  just like a lot of people are like maybe not entirely happy with like the,

792
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:43,005
Speaker 18:  the improvements between the two models and are just kind of saying that

793
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:46,525
Speaker 18:  like, oh, Fuji is capitalizing on the popularity of this camera. They're

794
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:50,405
Speaker 18:  gonna do an iterative update for it and also raise the price

795
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:54,565
Speaker 18:  for it as well. Instead of making more of the X 100

796
00:50:55,025 --> 00:50:58,165
Speaker 18:  vs. They're just gonna make more of the X 106 now.

797
00:50:58,625 --> 00:50:59,205
Speaker 1:  Got it. Okay.

798
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:00,925
Speaker 18:  Which I think that's fair.

799
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:05,165
Speaker 19:  I don't think there's anything wrong with having small

800
00:51:05,435 --> 00:51:09,365
Speaker 19:  updates to systems. It's funny, I was sent a review

801
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:13,085
Speaker 19:  of the X 100 T done nine years ago,

802
00:51:13,435 --> 00:51:17,165
Speaker 19:  changed some names around and that review could be used for the X

803
00:51:17,185 --> 00:51:20,925
Speaker 19:  106, but don don't think there's anything wrong with that. It's a good system.

804
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:24,765
Speaker 19:  It has a good, like what we would, you know, quote unquote call a retro

805
00:51:25,035 --> 00:51:28,685
Speaker 19:  feel and that's a good thing. Don't fix it if it ain't broke. Yeah.

806
00:51:29,305 --> 00:51:33,005
Speaker 1:  So, I. I do wonder though if part of the appeal of the X 100

807
00:51:33,205 --> 00:51:37,165
Speaker 1:  V was that it became so rare and hard to

808
00:51:37,165 --> 00:51:41,045
Speaker 1:  get and was such a cool kind of status symbol to be able to shoot

809
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:45,245
Speaker 1:  with and have in the background of your shots and whatever. Is this thing

810
00:51:45,705 --> 00:51:49,485
Speaker 1:  if it floods the market and everybody who wants one can get one, is it gonna

811
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:52,205
Speaker 1:  be as cool and viral as the V was?

812
00:51:52,785 --> 00:51:53,005
Speaker 19:  No.

813
00:51:53,395 --> 00:51:56,445
Speaker 18:  Yeah, the answer is like, no, it's been a very

814
00:51:56,735 --> 00:52:00,725
Speaker 18:  polarizing camera since, I don't know, like for like last

815
00:52:00,725 --> 00:52:04,605
Speaker 18:  week. All I can see on threads and everywhere else is just like,

816
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:08,125
Speaker 18:  people have a lot of opinions about this camera and I think like its popularity

817
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,605
Speaker 18:  is making some quote unquote like real photographers kind of mad

818
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:13,765
Speaker 18:  'cause they feel like they're, the other ones are like, they don't know

819
00:52:13,765 --> 00:52:16,685
Speaker 18:  what to do with the camera. What they have it, they, the whole idea behind

820
00:52:16,705 --> 00:52:20,445
Speaker 18:  the X 100 is that it's like a very much like a proper

821
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:24,845
Speaker 18:  photographer's camera. It's the poor manica so to speak.

822
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:28,485
Speaker 18:  It's the one that's like, you know, you, you're kind of limited to these

823
00:52:28,485 --> 00:52:32,165
Speaker 18:  like form factor of it. I think the general

824
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:36,205
Speaker 18:  kind of consensus and conversation around it is kind of switching a

825
00:52:36,205 --> 00:52:39,525
Speaker 18:  little bit too, like a negative in a way.

826
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:43,525
Speaker 19:  Yeah. V sent me this, this great thread and it just says

827
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:46,925
Speaker 19:  you're gonna take the same shitty photos with the X 106 that you were taking

828
00:52:46,925 --> 00:52:50,765
Speaker 19:  before you spent that $1,500 stay broke. King. Oof.

829
00:52:50,985 --> 00:52:51,565
Speaker 19:  That's perfect.

830
00:52:52,605 --> 00:52:55,965
Speaker 18:  I know it was pretty funny, but yeah, I feel like a lot of people have like

831
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:59,085
Speaker 18:  a lot of opinions about it, about like how to properly use this camera.

832
00:52:59,185 --> 00:53:02,565
Speaker 18:  It, it's weird, it used to be like kind of like a, like a little bit of

833
00:53:02,565 --> 00:53:06,165
Speaker 18:  a secret. Like it wasn't never as popular and it was just like, oh you can

834
00:53:06,165 --> 00:53:10,085
Speaker 18:  get a lot of great stuff with this tiny camera and now it feels like, it's

835
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:13,965
Speaker 18:  like switches, like pendulum just kind of like swung in

836
00:53:14,005 --> 00:53:16,685
Speaker 18:  the other direction and some people are kind of getting mad about it or

837
00:53:16,685 --> 00:53:20,085
Speaker 18:  trying to justify their own purchases and I don't know, it's weird. It's

838
00:53:20,085 --> 00:53:22,485
Speaker 18:  like, it's like cons Wars, but cameras

839
00:53:23,225 --> 00:53:25,830
Speaker 1:  And if I've learned one thing about the photography community over the year,

840
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,765
Speaker 1:  it's that everybody is super chill about new ideas and new things

841
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:33,885
Speaker 1:  and everybody, nobody has like really strong entrenched opinions about the

842
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:36,925
Speaker 1:  right ways to do things and everybody's just very relaxed.

843
00:53:37,395 --> 00:53:40,125
Speaker 18:  Yeah. It is fundamentally like a, a very objective

844
00:53:41,425 --> 00:53:43,445
Speaker 18:  art form and yeah,

845
00:53:43,745 --> 00:53:46,965
Speaker 19:  But okay, what there's like so many other products that are sold with like

846
00:53:47,025 --> 00:53:50,885
Speaker 19:  the promise of greatness, right? Like I I, my mind goes to the Apple Watch

847
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:53,645
Speaker 19:  ultra. It's like people are gonna buy this and then they're gonna go hike

848
00:53:53,845 --> 00:53:57,805
Speaker 19:  mountains and get lost and get saved and it's like no. So it's kind

849
00:53:57,805 --> 00:54:00,845
Speaker 19:  of, you know, similar to that, which there's nothing wrong with that. We

850
00:54:00,845 --> 00:54:04,605
Speaker 19:  all have ideas of who we wanna be and think that buying something

851
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:07,605
Speaker 19:  to make us that thing will, you know, I dunno make us feel better.

852
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:09,845
Speaker 18:  Are you calling it an aspirational product

853
00:54:10,265 --> 00:54:12,365
Speaker 19:  For some? I, yeah, I am. So

854
00:54:12,775 --> 00:54:15,005
Speaker 1:  Becca you've been, you've been shooting with it a little bit. You're gonna,

855
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:18,165
Speaker 1:  you're gonna make a, a video and do some stuff for us, but what's the, what's

856
00:54:18,165 --> 00:54:20,605
Speaker 1:  the early returns on your time with it so far?

857
00:54:20,955 --> 00:54:24,725
Speaker 19:  Yeah, I mean it's, it's beautiful to hold, it's very fun to use.

858
00:54:25,445 --> 00:54:28,965
Speaker 19:  I love that about it. I don't think it's as turnkey

859
00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:33,365
Speaker 19:  as everybody claims. The idea that anybody could

860
00:54:33,365 --> 00:54:37,285
Speaker 19:  pick this up and just have great photos is, I mean simply not the

861
00:54:37,285 --> 00:54:41,165
Speaker 19:  truth. Even knowing like what each film stock looks like and like

862
00:54:41,475 --> 00:54:45,045
Speaker 19:  kind of honing in the look that you want to get from this camera

863
00:54:45,545 --> 00:54:48,925
Speaker 19:  is not a walk in the park. So I've been thinking about it like I don't know

864
00:54:48,925 --> 00:54:52,805
Speaker 19:  if I've just been watching too much HGTV, but I've been like tons of curb

865
00:54:52,805 --> 00:54:56,125
Speaker 19:  appeal in this camera but it is not turnkey. That's

866
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,165
Speaker 1:  Very good. HGTV would be very proud of you. I thought you were gonna make

867
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:02,405
Speaker 1:  a whole like house flipping analogy but I like that even better. It's very

868
00:55:02,405 --> 00:55:06,085
Speaker 19:  Good. Don't gimme, don't gimme props for that. I, it's, I am workshopping

869
00:55:06,105 --> 00:55:06,325
Speaker 19:  it.

870
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:09,805
Speaker 1:  Vern, are you gonna buy one you you sold, did you have a five that you sold?

871
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:13,525
Speaker 18:  No, I only had the the third, the tea. Oh

872
00:55:13,525 --> 00:55:17,325
Speaker 1:  Right, okay. So you had the tea, you sold it. Hoping for this one, is it

873
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:18,405
Speaker 1:  everything you hoped it would be?

874
00:55:20,085 --> 00:55:22,685
Speaker 18:  Honestly like what Becca said earlier, like you can look at the old review

875
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:25,685
Speaker 18:  and it'll like a lot of things will just like transfer over. I think it

876
00:55:25,685 --> 00:55:29,645
Speaker 18:  like it is very much like the form factor of it is fantastic. The

877
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:33,125
Speaker 18:  fact that it has this like new sensor, which I haven't used yet. It's been

878
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:37,045
Speaker 18:  in the XD five, it's been the Xh two wood

879
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:41,125
Speaker 18:  ibis and the 40 megapixel count. Very intrigued by

880
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:44,725
Speaker 18:  that. I've heard great things about just like how well it

881
00:55:45,165 --> 00:55:48,165
Speaker 18:  maximizes the smaller sensors. Some people wanted it to be a full frame

882
00:55:48,165 --> 00:55:51,365
Speaker 18:  camera and I completely understand that. I do think there's like,

883
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:55,925
Speaker 18:  you know Fuji's kind of like putting the eggs in the crop sensor and

884
00:55:56,065 --> 00:55:59,925
Speaker 18:  the median format and they're skipping full frame entirely and with a

885
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:03,725
Speaker 18:  fixed lens there's like maybe one day they will make this thing a full

886
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:07,045
Speaker 18:  frame. I can see that happening because I don't know, I feel like you can

887
00:56:07,045 --> 00:56:10,205
Speaker 18:  only get that much out of a smaller sensor but it looks like they are able

888
00:56:10,205 --> 00:56:13,485
Speaker 18:  to get a lot out of it. People are raving about like how good the sensor

889
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:17,605
Speaker 18:  is. So I sold the tea. I was like you know, maybe I'll

890
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:21,445
Speaker 18:  buy this one. I have a confession. I did pre-order it

891
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:25,405
Speaker 18:  late last night. Oh like all day. I know I was waiting

892
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:28,725
Speaker 18:  to tell you Becca, but here we are. I'm doing it publicly in front of you

893
00:56:28,745 --> 00:56:32,525
Speaker 18:  and everyone else. No I was, I had it in my basket for a while

894
00:56:32,825 --> 00:56:36,605
Speaker 18:  and I was like, can I get it? And then I read a couple of reviews late

895
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:40,525
Speaker 18:  last night 'cause I was only able to like go through all the X 100 coverage

896
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:45,045
Speaker 18:  yesterday and I'm like, I just miss having that camera.

897
00:56:45,515 --> 00:56:49,365
Speaker 18:  Like I just miss having an X 100 in my arsenal. Just

898
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:52,845
Speaker 18:  like a thing that I can bring everywhere and feel good about. Just like,

899
00:56:52,995 --> 00:56:56,285
Speaker 18:  yeah I'm like, I don't know, not bringing like a massive camera but have

900
00:56:56,285 --> 00:56:59,365
Speaker 18:  something that's like fundamentally like super fun to use.

901
00:57:00,065 --> 00:57:02,645
Speaker 18:  So the pre-order is in, I've caved.

902
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,445
Speaker 1:  We always knew you were going to veen if it makes you feel any better. Yeah,

903
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:07,565
Speaker 1:  I know there was never a question.

904
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:11,925
Speaker 19:  I mean truly I, I almost pre-ordered one as well, but

905
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:15,725
Speaker 19:  then I remembered that I can just put a pancake lens on my A seven C

906
00:57:16,305 --> 00:57:20,285
Speaker 19:  and I know Lightroom well enough I could pop things into there. So,

907
00:57:20,465 --> 00:57:24,285
Speaker 1:  But hey, if the answer is it looks kick ass and takes kick ass pictures and

908
00:57:24,585 --> 00:57:27,125
Speaker 1:  it will make people follow me on TikTok and that's the reason people buy

909
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:29,885
Speaker 1:  cameras. I'll take it. I'll take anything we need. I'm into it. People

910
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:33,685
Speaker 19:  Pay a lot of money for clothing accessories and this is, this is one of

911
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:35,285
Speaker 19:  them at for some folks not for ruin.

912
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,645
Speaker 1:  Exactly. All right, thank you both so much for being here.

913
00:57:39,075 --> 00:57:40,085
Speaker 1:  It's super fun as always.

914
00:57:40,255 --> 00:57:40,685
Speaker 19:  Thank you.

915
00:57:41,095 --> 00:57:41,565
Speaker 18:  Thank you.

916
00:57:42,395 --> 00:57:45,645
Speaker 1:  Alright we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna do a question from

917
00:57:45,645 --> 00:57:47,485
Speaker 1:  The Vergecast Hotline. We'll be right back.

918
01:00:06,045 --> 01:00:08,985
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's get to The. Vergecast Hotline as always. The

919
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:12,665
Speaker 1:  number is 8 6 6 Verge one one or you can email Vergecast at The Verge dot

920
01:00:12,665 --> 01:00:15,785
Speaker 1:  com. We love all your questions. We try to do at least one on the show every

921
01:00:15,785 --> 01:00:19,625
Speaker 1:  week. This week we have a question about our right to repair segment from

922
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:23,185
Speaker 1:  last week, which will pour is here to help me answer Hi Will. Hello. We got

923
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:25,745
Speaker 1:  a bunch of good feedback on that episode. People liked it. People are super

924
01:00:25,745 --> 01:00:28,985
Speaker 1:  interested in Right to repair. Love it. Everybody wants to break their own

925
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,585
Speaker 1:  batteries by themselves, don't

926
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:33,745
Speaker 25:  I? I don't wanna be responsible for that but but that's great.

927
01:00:34,405 --> 01:00:38,265
Speaker 1:  But we got one question from a bunch of people I would say

928
01:00:38,325 --> 01:00:41,065
Speaker 1:  as people are want to do, some people were very nice about it, some people

929
01:00:41,065 --> 01:00:44,465
Speaker 1:  were very rude about it. Oh God. But we got this question over and over so

930
01:00:44,465 --> 01:00:47,185
Speaker 1:  I'm gonna read an email from Mike that I would say is representative of a

931
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,185
Speaker 1:  bunch of the feedback we got. Mike says, one big thing you left outta the

932
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:52,665
Speaker 1:  parts pairing section of your right to repair discussion was the rise of

933
01:00:52,665 --> 01:00:56,545
Speaker 1:  phone chop shops because things like activation lock and stolen device

934
01:00:56,545 --> 01:01:00,025
Speaker 1:  protection prevent thieves from using or reselling iPhones whole. There's

935
01:01:00,025 --> 01:01:03,065
Speaker 1:  now a burgeoning market of phone chop shops where much like their automotive

936
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:06,065
Speaker 1:  counterparts stolen phones are being disassembled and sold on as parts

937
01:01:06,215 --> 01:01:09,705
Speaker 1:  serialization and parts pairing deters this since thieves can no longer use

938
01:01:09,705 --> 01:01:12,945
Speaker 1:  or sell parts from stolen phones. I know this is something you also talked

939
01:01:12,945 --> 01:01:16,825
Speaker 1:  to a bunch of people about, so I'm curious what your thoughts on that

940
01:01:16,825 --> 01:01:18,385
Speaker 1:  piece of the parts pair argument are.

941
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:22,745
Speaker 25:  Yeah, so that listener mentioned activation locks,

942
01:01:22,795 --> 01:01:26,785
Speaker 25:  which we didn't talk about because it is a completely different system from

943
01:01:26,785 --> 01:01:30,465
Speaker 25:  Apple, but that is sort of the primary way that Apple prevents

944
01:01:30,465 --> 01:01:34,145
Speaker 25:  stolen working phones from being wiped and resold.

945
01:01:34,485 --> 01:01:38,265
Speaker 25:  So that's the system where your phone is tied to your iCloud

946
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:42,185
Speaker 25:  account and if someone steals it, that

947
01:01:42,185 --> 01:01:45,585
Speaker 25:  motherboard is sort of forever locked to your account and without you,

948
01:01:45,775 --> 01:01:49,705
Speaker 25:  there's nothing they can do to resell that working phone. So that is

949
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:53,625
Speaker 25:  a very important anti-fat mechanism for Apple that's different

950
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:57,705
Speaker 25:  from parts pairing and there's nothing to my

951
01:01:57,705 --> 01:02:01,105
Speaker 25:  knowledge that prevents someone from stealing a phone

952
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:05,385
Speaker 25:  and chopping it up and selling all of the parts individually. you know,

953
01:02:05,385 --> 01:02:08,465
Speaker 25:  one thing we didn't talk about a ton is that not all of the parts in an

954
01:02:08,465 --> 01:02:11,945
Speaker 25:  iPhone are paired to the motherboard. Lots of them aren't.

955
01:02:12,325 --> 01:02:16,185
Speaker 25:  So any of those parts would be super easy to take apart and sell and

956
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:19,805
Speaker 25:  activation locking doesn't prevent that in any way.

957
01:02:20,225 --> 01:02:23,845
Speaker 25:  And even the paired parts are resellable, it's

958
01:02:24,045 --> 01:02:28,005
Speaker 25:  annoying to reuse the paired parts from a stolen phone just like it's

959
01:02:28,125 --> 01:02:32,045
Speaker 25:  annoying to reuse the paired parts from a non-ST stolen, a broken phone.

960
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:35,685
Speaker 25:  So that's, you know, that doesn't help or hurt the

961
01:02:36,005 --> 01:02:38,005
Speaker 25:  anti-fat cause one way or the other.

962
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:41,365
Speaker 1:  Have you heard Apple try to make the security argument at all? you know,

963
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:45,285
Speaker 1:  you mentioned it's put out statements kind of both in favor of these

964
01:02:45,635 --> 01:02:49,365
Speaker 1:  laws for right to repair, but also making what I would say are relatively

965
01:02:49,575 --> 01:02:53,285
Speaker 1:  consistent arguments that not having parts pairing and allowing right to

966
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:57,205
Speaker 1:  repair is a security risk for lots of different reasons. I mean

967
01:02:57,205 --> 01:03:00,485
Speaker 1:  like we talked about on the show, there's issues with the biometric stuff

968
01:03:00,665 --> 01:03:04,605
Speaker 1:  and all that. Has Apple made the theft argument

969
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:06,005
Speaker 1:  at all that you've seen?

970
01:03:06,545 --> 01:03:10,045
Speaker 25:  Not really, no. And they, you know, offered a kind of a rare public

971
01:03:10,405 --> 01:03:14,365
Speaker 25:  testimony in Oregon that we talked about on last week's show. They ran down

972
01:03:14,425 --> 01:03:17,605
Speaker 25:  all of the reasons why they're very attached to part pairing and like you

973
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:21,165
Speaker 25:  say, it's, it's safety, it's security around

974
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:25,085
Speaker 25:  keeping people from hacking your, your biometric sensors.

975
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:29,085
Speaker 25:  They didn't bring up theft one way or the other. When it comes to part

976
01:03:29,085 --> 01:03:32,405
Speaker 25:  pairing, is it possible that Apple sees parts

977
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:36,645
Speaker 25:  pairing as part of their anti-fat strategy

978
01:03:36,645 --> 01:03:40,245
Speaker 25:  broadly just because again, it, it makes parts more

979
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:44,085
Speaker 25:  annoying to work with outside of Apple's own repair ecosystem.

980
01:03:44,435 --> 01:03:47,525
Speaker 25:  Sure. Maybe they see that as a knock on benefit but it's not something that

981
01:03:47,525 --> 01:03:50,725
Speaker 25:  they talk about actively around parts pairing.

982
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:54,965
Speaker 1:  Okay. Yeah, it seems like one of those things where there might be something

983
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:58,765
Speaker 1:  to the idea that having these parts be digitally signed might help

984
01:03:58,765 --> 01:04:02,645
Speaker 1:  you sort of trace things as they go wrong. Like it would help in an investigation

985
01:04:02,745 --> 01:04:06,605
Speaker 1:  of stolen parts maybe more so than it would actually

986
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:09,245
Speaker 1:  deter people from selling the parts.

987
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:13,765
Speaker 25:  Yeah, again, it doesn't, you know, it doesn't really hamper the existence

988
01:04:13,765 --> 01:04:17,565
Speaker 25:  of chop shops any more so than, again, prepared parts are

989
01:04:17,725 --> 01:04:21,565
Speaker 25:  annoying to work with So I. you know, the one thing I will mention is

990
01:04:21,565 --> 01:04:25,285
Speaker 25:  that that activation lock system is something that

991
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:29,445
Speaker 25:  repair shop owners are not super wild about and right to repair advocates

992
01:04:29,445 --> 01:04:30,565
Speaker 25:  are not super wild about.

993
01:04:30,745 --> 01:04:32,005
Speaker 1:  Oh, interesting. Why? Because

994
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:36,285
Speaker 25:  It means that, you know, abandoned phones or just

995
01:04:36,345 --> 01:04:39,925
Speaker 25:  any, any kind of phone that is not stolen but you know has

996
01:04:39,955 --> 01:04:43,925
Speaker 25:  doesn't have an owner anymore, it's sort of lost forever. The activation

997
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:47,725
Speaker 25:  locking is pretty bulletproof. So if someone brings a phone

998
01:04:47,835 --> 01:04:51,525
Speaker 25:  into a repair shop and never comes back for it, there's not much that the

999
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:54,805
Speaker 25:  repair shop owner can do with that. Even if they've done all of their due

1000
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:58,765
Speaker 25:  diligence to try to return that to the owner, that phone basically has to

1001
01:04:58,765 --> 01:05:00,845
Speaker 25:  be scrapped for parts or tossed. That

1002
01:05:00,845 --> 01:05:04,605
Speaker 1:  Always makes me think of like at The Verge obviously we get tons of review

1003
01:05:04,605 --> 01:05:08,565
Speaker 1:  units of gadgets and every once in a while somebody will, you know, put

1004
01:05:08,565 --> 01:05:12,405
Speaker 1:  their data on a phone or a tablet or a laptop or whatever, lock it with a

1005
01:05:12,405 --> 01:05:16,245
Speaker 1:  passcode and then leave The Verge. And so we have this

1006
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:20,165
Speaker 1:  closet full of devices that literally no one can access. We can't access

1007
01:05:20,165 --> 01:05:23,365
Speaker 1:  them, we can't send them back to the company. To have some way in like this

1008
01:05:23,365 --> 01:05:27,325
Speaker 1:  stuff is permanently tied to someone's pin code that they

1009
01:05:27,345 --> 01:05:31,005
Speaker 1:  set up. you know, in a moment of just sort of randomly setting up a device

1010
01:05:31,225 --> 01:05:34,045
Speaker 1:  and you forget how, especially do you remember on old Android funds, you

1011
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:37,845
Speaker 1:  had to draw the shape. Yeah, yeah, totally of the unlock If. you didn't have

1012
01:05:37,905 --> 01:05:41,285
Speaker 1:  one of those, that was the one you always did. I guarantee you

1013
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:44,325
Speaker 1:  50% of the time you would forget what you did because you're constantly setting

1014
01:05:44,325 --> 01:05:48,205
Speaker 1:  up new funds, right? Which on the one hand huge security win on the other

1015
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:52,125
Speaker 1:  hand, total disaster and So I can imagine that

1016
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:56,045
Speaker 1:  being a problem for basically anyone. Like I have a drawer full of

1017
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:59,645
Speaker 1:  smartphones because of what my life is and there's probably at least a handful

1018
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,925
Speaker 1:  of them that neither I nor anyone else will ever get into ever again.

1019
01:06:03,075 --> 01:06:06,645
Speaker 25:  Well, clearly what we need is an a, a Verge chop shop. Like we,

1020
01:06:07,025 --> 01:06:10,605
Speaker 25:  we just need to start selling parts from all of the random gadgets that

1021
01:06:10,605 --> 01:06:11,445
Speaker 25:  we've accumulated.

1022
01:06:11,585 --> 01:06:14,845
Speaker 1:  Listen there, you just saved the media business right there at will. Poor,

1023
01:06:16,265 --> 01:06:17,165
Speaker 25:  Always happy to help.

1024
01:06:17,585 --> 01:06:20,805
Speaker 1:  All right, If, you wanna reach Will on all the right to repair stuff. You're

1025
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:23,805
Speaker 1:  covering this basically for the rest of the year. I think this is like a

1026
01:06:23,805 --> 01:06:26,085
Speaker 1:  thing you're gonna be interested in and presumably forever, but definitely

1027
01:06:26,085 --> 01:06:28,725
Speaker 1:  for the rest of this year. 'cause we both feel like this is a big year.

1028
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:31,845
Speaker 25:  This is why I don't, I never wanted to have a beat 'cause I wanted to just

1029
01:06:31,865 --> 01:06:35,125
Speaker 25:  do a story and move on with my life. But yes. Yeah, I'm the right to repair

1030
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:35,445
