Description: It's a big week for the smart home. Jake, Vee, and Jen sit down to chat about all the new tech out of IFA, from robots that carry robot vacuums up stairs to upgrades that turn 10-year-old Hue bulbs into motion sensors. Then, Lauren joins the show to talk about the Google antitrust remedies ruling and what Google is going to have to do to allow more competition in the search market. Finally, the Thunder Round is back and better than ever. We're talking $2,000 smart watches, Amazon yanking a major Prime perk, the Pixel 10 Pro's 100x AI zoom, Instagram for iPad, and drama at the FTC.

Speaker 6:  having several existential crises as I test out

14
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:38,435
Speaker 6:  text claims to make your life better with whatever app,

15
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:42,715

18
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:52,235
Speaker 5:  I'm so excited for this v's. Already been writing basically a bunch of these

19
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:55,035
Speaker 5:  on the site. And so if you've been reading her stuff lately, being like,

20
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:58,835
Speaker 5:  these are wild, these are ridiculous. Like, that's, that's what optimizers

21
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:01,885
Speaker 5:  is gonna be. It's gonna be really fun. So check it out The Verge dot com.

22
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:07,045
Speaker 5:  We've got a lot to talk about today. There is a huge

23
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,045
Speaker 5:  ruling in the Google antitrust case. Lauren Finer, The Verge

24
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:14,925
Speaker 5:  Senior Policy Reporter is gonna join us later to talk about that. But first

25
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:19,445
Speaker 5:  we've got Jen Tuey here. She's in Berlin

26
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:23,885
Speaker 5:  at the Iffa Trade Show. Jen, how's it going? Good,

27
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:27,765
Speaker 7:  Thanks. Yeah, hot and sweaty. It's like 900 degrees in

28
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:27,965
Speaker 7:  Berlin,

29
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,965
Speaker 7:  but having a, having a blast checking out all the, the fun gadgets and the

30
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:36,885
Speaker 7:  robots carrying robots. So it's, it's, it's

31
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,005
Speaker 7:  always a good time here.

32
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,525
Speaker 5:  Okay. I have an important question. How is your hotel

33
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,525
Speaker 5:  room? Is there any smart tech that's,

34
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:46,645
Speaker 7:  No,

35
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:49,245
Speaker 5:  It's not. I've

36
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:52,605
Speaker 7:  Never been in a smart tech hotel. I think they only exist in California,

37
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:56,405
Speaker 5:  Honestly. Oh, okay. Well that's that We need to make your next trip over

38
00:03:56,405 --> 00:04:00,125
Speaker 5:  to California. Yes. I thought I was hoping that because of efa, you'd, you'd

39
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:04,005
Speaker 5:  have a, a slightly smarter swankier AI

40
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:06,805
Speaker 5:  infused hotel. But no, nothing yet. No.

41
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,165
Speaker 7:  Okay,

42
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:07,765
Speaker 5:  We'll, we'll get there.

43
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:10,525
Speaker 7:  This, this one can't even do the air conditioning. It's definitely not smart.

44
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:11,085
Speaker 7:  Oof.

45
00:04:11,355 --> 00:04:13,125
Speaker 5:  It's not good. What floor are you on?

46
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,205
Speaker 7:  I can open my window. That's the nice thing

47
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,005
Speaker 5:  About Europe. Okay.

48
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:18,845
Speaker 7:  Okay. Is Europeans that you open windows.

49
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:23,165
Speaker 5:  That's, you know what, that's technology. Yes. It's a different kind. That

50
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:23,405
Speaker 5:  is very

51
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:23,565
Speaker 7:  True.

52
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:28,205
Speaker 5:  So Jen is in, in Germany for efa. Iffa is this

53
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:32,165
Speaker 5:  big European tech show. There's been a lot of stuff going

54
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:36,045
Speaker 5:  on. Samsung announced a new fe phone and a tablet anchor has a cool new

55
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:39,925
Speaker 5:  party speaker slash party projector. But Smart Home

56
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:43,205
Speaker 5:  is the start of the show. It has been for the last few years. There are a

57
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:47,045
Speaker 5:  bunch of robot vacuums, a lot of smart lights, a big announcement from

58
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:51,205
Speaker 5:  Phillips Hue that turns its smart bulbs into motion detectors.

59
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,085
Speaker 5:  We're gonna get into all of that. I, I guess, Jen, you've been walking around

60
00:04:56,085 --> 00:05:00,045
Speaker 5:  the show all day. How is it and, and what are people buzzing about?

61
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:04,525
Speaker 7:  So today was the media day, and unlike, so if it is kind of

62
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:08,365
Speaker 7:  like CES for Europe, but unlike

63
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:12,325
Speaker 7:  CES for America and here in in efa, you don't have to go to

64
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:15,685
Speaker 7:  little boring press rooms. They have their press conferences for all the

65
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:19,445
Speaker 7:  media on the show floor, but they haven't finished putting their booth together.

66
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:23,565
Speaker 7:  So we're basically dodging, literally dodging forklift

67
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:27,165
Speaker 7:  trucks and ladders and like buckets of paint as we try

68
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:31,605
Speaker 7:  and go and, and check out these press conferences. So I haven't got to really

69
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,445
Speaker 7:  get hands on in too many booths yet because they're

70
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:39,405
Speaker 7:  still building them. But we got a lot of announcements. So, but it was

71
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:42,965
Speaker 7:  fun to sort of get a few sneak peeks, you know, round the back of the curtain

72
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:48,205
Speaker 7:  for some of the booths. So dreamy had a big press conference in their

73
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:52,125
Speaker 7:  booth today, and that was one of the, one

74
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:56,005
Speaker 7:  of the more sort of, huh, this is kind of cool, but do we really

75
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,805
Speaker 7:  need it Moments, which was a stair climbing

76
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:04,365
Speaker 7:  robot. And this is something that has been sort of dear to my

77
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,965
Speaker 7:  heart in the robot vacuum world, you know, robots with

78
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:10,605
Speaker 7:  various limbs and things that they can

79
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:13,565
Speaker 5:  Do, like actual, like proper stairs because I feel like it's been announced

80
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:16,285
Speaker 5:  before proper stairs. And they're like, it can, it's actually just like a

81
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:18,805
Speaker 5:  bump. You go of a bump know you're right. So this is, this will walk.

82
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:22,645
Speaker 7:  We've had these levels. We now we're at the B this, so, so

83
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:25,125
Speaker 5:  What are we talking about here? Legs, treads,

84
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:29,245
Speaker 7:  Treads. So it's, it's okay. It's actually, they call them arms or, well,

85
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:33,085
Speaker 7:  there's two companies that have actually released the same robot concept.

86
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:37,445
Speaker 7:  UFI has one, which you can actually are gonna be able to buy relatively soon,

87
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:41,365
Speaker 7:  I think next year. And then dreamy has announced its concept

88
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:45,765
Speaker 7:  and its tracks and they basically fold their

89
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:49,765
Speaker 7:  sort of arms out from the body and turn into tracks

90
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,845
Speaker 7:  and then track, track, track, track, track up the stairs. So it went up like

91
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:56,925
Speaker 7:  nine stairs and then stopped, turned around and came

92
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:57,845
Speaker 7:  down. That's

93
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,205
Speaker 5:  Almost a whole flight of stairs. That's almost,

94
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:03,565
Speaker 6:  Is there a limit to the number of stairs they can do? Because, you know,

95
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:07,285
Speaker 6:  I live in a four floor townhouse. It would be nice to have one

96
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:10,965
Speaker 6:  stair climbing robot instead of four robo vacuums

97
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:13,525
Speaker 6:  that are limited to each floor. So,

98
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:17,565
Speaker 7:  So they didn't release specs on the dreamy one, but the UFI

99
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:21,565
Speaker 7:  one, they did say it can go up to, I think it was up to five flights

100
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:26,285
Speaker 7:  and they can turn corners and so, you know, and, and do different

101
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:30,645
Speaker 7:  shapes of stairs. But the way it works is instead of it actually being

102
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:34,565
Speaker 7:  a robot vacuum, it's just a robot and the robot vacuum gets

103
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:38,565
Speaker 7:  into it and gets carried up. So it's like a stair lift for

104
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:39,285
Speaker 7:  your robot vacuum.

105
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:43,085
Speaker 6:  Oh my God. That is so cool

106
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:46,685
Speaker 6:  and so frightening at the same time.

107
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:48,765
Speaker 6:  I'm just

108
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:52,605
Speaker 7:  Waiting for my cat to like, decide, okay, I'm gonna hop on and get, get a

109
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:52,925
Speaker 7:  ride

110
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:56,685
Speaker 5:  Up. Okay. Got w So it's, it's a robot for your ro it's a myth. It's a robot

111
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,565
Speaker 5:  for that your robot gets into. Yeah, and that's, I feel

112
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,485
Speaker 5:  like we've gone too far. I think you have

113
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,685
Speaker 7:  To Engineers cleaning our floors. I really do.

114
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:07,565
Speaker 5:  It's, that's so impressive. The other

115
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:11,005
Speaker 7:  Thing that thing that gets me is it doesn't clean the stairs. I want something

116
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:11,645
Speaker 7:  that cleans

117
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:12,205
Speaker 5:  The stairs.

118
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,645
Speaker 6:  Oh, come on. It's right there.

119
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:18,965
Speaker 5:  That's next year's robot. It, it will also carry the separate, buy

120
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,725
Speaker 5:  it separately stair cleaning bot as it brings it up.

121
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:27,165
Speaker 5:  I, so yeah, it's a little crazy. Rob robots are always good for like, truly

122
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:30,325
Speaker 5:  ridiculous robot technology. It does feel like they really turned a corner

123
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:34,125
Speaker 5:  this year and have been adding all these limbs and appendages. It's

124
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,605
Speaker 5:  wild. It's not clear that any of them work like amazingly you tested the

125
00:08:37,605 --> 00:08:41,325
Speaker 5:  one with the arm, with the robot arm, right? Yeah. And it was like, eh, it

126
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:41,725
Speaker 5:  was fine

127
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:44,885
Speaker 7:  At a vacuum, but the arm was very limited.

128
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:49,085
Speaker 6:  Well, you know, it's Gen one, it's a gen one arm.

129
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:53,405
Speaker 6:  Yes. So I I I do, I do have one question about EFA

130
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:56,325
Speaker 6:  and is it still at Mess Berlin? Yeah.

131
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:01,365
Speaker 7:  Which is a, a, a fascinating building. I mean if you're into brutalist

132
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:05,165
Speaker 7:  German architecture, then you will love this place. But it's also

133
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:08,645
Speaker 7:  a maze, which is actually, you know, there's stairs everywhere. So honestly

134
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:11,045
Speaker 7:  I could have used one of these for me, like a Jen

135
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:15,925
Speaker 7:  transporter to take me around around the,

136
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:18,925
Speaker 5:  The conference. That's how they'll really impress us. Yes. So what, what

137
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,005
Speaker 5:  has been your number one thing so far of the show?

138
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:24,565
Speaker 7:  Well, I, I was very into all the Hue lighting

139
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,765
Speaker 7:  announcements yesterday. They, they did a big event

140
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,765
Speaker 7:  out, not actually in the message, which is probably one of the reasons

141
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:33,325
Speaker 7:  I liked it.

142
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:39,805
Speaker 7:  And they did a big event where they announced a ton of new lights.

143
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:43,285
Speaker 7:  The sort of headline feature for most people is that their products are getting

144
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:47,125
Speaker 7:  cheaper or, so they've re released a

145
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:51,085
Speaker 7:  new line of essentials light bulbs that starts at around $15 a bulb,

146
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:54,605
Speaker 7:  which is still not the least expensive smart bulb you can buy.

147
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:55,085
Speaker 7:  But

148
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:57,685
Speaker 5:  Definitely, I mean that's like a quarter of the price, right? Yeah, yeah.

149
00:09:57,685 --> 00:09:58,885
Speaker 5:  Like a hu bulb is 60 bucks.

150
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,925
Speaker 7:  60 bucks. So it's 25 9, 24 99

151
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:06,925
Speaker 7:  for a single essentials bulb. But if you buy a four pack, it's down

152
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:10,445
Speaker 7:  to $15 a bulb. So it's, yeah, it's, that's, that's great.

153
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:13,045
Speaker 5:  That's wild pricing for, for Hue big

154
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:13,645
Speaker 6:  Change the colors.

155
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,925
Speaker 7:  Yes. So they're all white and color ambiance bulbs, they just have, so they

156
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:21,725
Speaker 7:  don't dim quite as deep. They have slightly less temperature

157
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:25,405
Speaker 7:  range and they say that the, while the color accuracy is very good,

158
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:29,685
Speaker 7:  it's not, they don't, it's not as guaranteed to

159
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:33,525
Speaker 7:  be match perfectly with all your other hue

160
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:37,485
Speaker 7:  bulbs in the way that their premium bulbs are. So that, that was

161
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:40,765
Speaker 7:  kind of nice I think for the market to see that because Hue has always been

162
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,525
Speaker 7:  a very popular product. But the number one complaint I hear from people

163
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:48,405
Speaker 7:  is it's just so expensive. And now there are all these other products on

164
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:51,805
Speaker 7:  the market and with Matter, you know, it's much easier. It used to be for

165
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:55,845
Speaker 7:  Hue, they worked with everyone. So that was a great selling point

166
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:59,325
Speaker 7:  and maybe one of the reasons you might think to spend more but with matter

167
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:03,405
Speaker 7:  now most smart lighting bulbs work with most platforms

168
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:07,765
Speaker 7:  so that they were kind of losing that differentiating factor. I think that

169
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:12,205
Speaker 7:  probably played into needing to move, you know, have more choice

170
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:16,085
Speaker 7:  for the, for people. But the really exciting thing for,

171
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:19,205
Speaker 7:  for me anyway, I'm not sure if this is as exciting for most people as the

172
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:22,845
Speaker 7:  pricing, but is that they have released a new

173
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:26,805
Speaker 7:  feature, which is a software upgrade that will go on every HU

174
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:30,605
Speaker 7:  Bobb made after 2014. So basically

175
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:34,165
Speaker 7:  second gen on that turns your light bulbs into motion sensors.

176
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:36,045
Speaker 5:  This is wild. This is,

177
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:40,125
Speaker 6:  This is what I've wanted this whole year of like

178
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:45,045
Speaker 6:  building my first smart home in this very vertical townhouse.

179
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:50,165
Speaker 6:  Like the Cold War my spouse And I have is over the smart lights.

180
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:53,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah. 'cause I like to use voice and they're like the

181
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:57,645
Speaker 6:  Google assistant kind of discriminates against their voice and never

182
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:01,485
Speaker 6:  works even though we've trained it. So they're just like, I

183
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:04,965
Speaker 6:  gotta pull out an app. What's wrong with a light switch? But you know,

184
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:09,165
Speaker 6:  if it was a motion sensor and I'm guessing it turns on when you walk

185
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:13,165
Speaker 6:  into a room or turns off when you leave it, then we don't have to have any

186
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,365
Speaker 6:  fights anymore about turning on the lights.

187
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:19,525
Speaker 7:  Tagline. This is save my Marriage. Yeah. Philip Hughes saving people's marriages.

188
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:20,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

189
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:20,805
Speaker 6:  I

190
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:24,045
Speaker 7:  Really, well you could get a motion sensor. EI mean to be fair, you can buy

191
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:24,925
Speaker 7:  motion sensor. We

192
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:27,765
Speaker 6:  Could, we could. But you know, it's, it's kind of cool if you don't have

193
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,085
Speaker 6:  to buy multiple devices

194
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:32,965
Speaker 7:  And motion sensors can be fiddly. It's kind of one of the

195
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:37,085
Speaker 7:  advantages of this tech is it covers a larger area than say a

196
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:41,005
Speaker 7:  traditional PIR sensor. But, but there are a few

197
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:44,685
Speaker 7:  caveats here. You have to have three bulbs in the room

198
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,445
Speaker 7:  in the area. You want the motion sensing because it kind of triangulates

199
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:52,325
Speaker 7:  and what it's using is RF sensing. So that's something

200
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:55,085
Speaker 7:  that we've seen with wifi, wireless wifi sensing,

201
00:12:56,465 --> 00:13:00,445
Speaker 7:  ZigBee, Bluetooth. There's some of this in a couple products

202
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:03,605
Speaker 7:  that use Bluetooth mesh sensing. But this is the first product to launch

203
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:07,525
Speaker 7:  that uses ZigBee RF sensing and it's a

204
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:10,885
Speaker 7:  technology developed by a company called Ivani called

205
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:15,285
Speaker 7:  fy, which I wrote about a, a year or so ago. And we kind of

206
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:19,045
Speaker 7:  speculated at the time that this might be what Hugh was going to be using

207
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:22,965
Speaker 7:  for its bulbs because they're obviously one of the most well-known ZigBee

208
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:26,445
Speaker 7:  based smart lighting lines. And so it use, it's basically just

209
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:29,925
Speaker 7:  detects disturbances in the radio frequency

210
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:33,845
Speaker 7:  signals between the bulbs. So that's why you need at least, I think they

211
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,805
Speaker 7:  recommend three to four, which could be a bit tricky and

212
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:41,605
Speaker 7:  depending on what kind of a room you have and you don't, I

213
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:44,765
Speaker 7:  asked and they said no, you don't do like, like three in a row. Like if you

214
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:47,765
Speaker 7:  had track lighting, that's probably not gonna work that well 'cause it's

215
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:51,485
Speaker 7:  not creating a zone. So there's gonna be a bit of setting up to do,

216
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,765
Speaker 7:  I did test a wifi version of this that whiz, which is

217
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:59,405
Speaker 7:  Hugh's sister company had for their bulbs

218
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:03,805
Speaker 7:  and it wasn't super reliable. It would turn

219
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:07,045
Speaker 7:  on okay. But it was the turning off part that was less reliable.

220
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:11,365
Speaker 7:  So, but Hugh says that they've worked, they've been working on this for,

221
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:13,845
Speaker 7:  for a long time, like multiple years

222
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:18,685
Speaker 7:  specifically sort of fine tuning the reliability aspect. So I'm

223
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:22,605
Speaker 7:  gonna be really interested to, to try it out because it is

224
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,445
Speaker 7:  the idea that you can take a product you already own

225
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:31,125
Speaker 7:  and upgrade it to get this kind of function is a

226
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,725
Speaker 7:  great thing for the smart home. Also not having little white

227
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:38,525
Speaker 7:  boxes and sensors around the house. I mean I have a hue motion sensor so

228
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:42,285
Speaker 7:  they're great, but like my kid will move it or

229
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:45,845
Speaker 7:  my husband will get annoyed by the light. You know, it's occasionally it

230
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:49,605
Speaker 7:  will blink a little LED light and he'll like put it flat on its face so it's

231
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:53,245
Speaker 7:  no longer sensing motion. But there is one caveat

232
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:57,445
Speaker 7:  you do have to have the new Hue bridge pro for this to work. Sorry,

233
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,205
Speaker 7:  just got that one in there. No,

234
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:02,285
Speaker 5:  No, no, that's great. So it, it really is remarkable though. Like I I truly

235
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:05,285
Speaker 5:  cannot think of another instance where a company went and

236
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:08,845
Speaker 5:  retroactively added a major feature to

237
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:13,205
Speaker 5:  10 years worth of products. Yeah. And especially something a

238
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:17,005
Speaker 5:  as substantially different as this. Like this is a very clever

239
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:20,005
Speaker 5:  implementation and a very clever new feature and

240
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:23,325
Speaker 5:  you know, you, you are right. Like there is this important caveat so you

241
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:27,005
Speaker 5:  do have to have this new hub to enable it. Yeah. And

242
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:30,005
Speaker 5:  it sounds like there's a legitimate reason for that, right? They're not just

243
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:30,965
Speaker 5:  like PEG gating it.

244
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:35,205
Speaker 7:  Right? So it is a heavy technical load

245
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:39,565
Speaker 7:  to process. So what happens is that the bulbs can be firmware

246
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,805
Speaker 7:  updated to support the sort of tech stack of the

247
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:47,245
Speaker 7:  ified technology with the hue technology sort of mixed in.

248
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:51,525
Speaker 7:  But they then all they do is detect motion. They don't

249
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:55,285
Speaker 7:  know what that motion is. And so they send their signals back to the

250
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:59,245
Speaker 7:  bridge, which processes uses algorithms that have been

251
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:02,605
Speaker 7:  kind of fine tuned to detect specific types of motion. So

252
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:07,125
Speaker 7:  there are two use cases for this that Hughes touting. There's motion

253
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:11,005
Speaker 7:  sensing for turning your lights on and that's free if, if you by

254
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:14,525
Speaker 7:  the bridge. But it's also been used for security 'cause Hugh has a

255
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:18,685
Speaker 7:  security suite of cameras and now a new siren.

256
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:22,845
Speaker 7:  So you could actually use it like a security system. And the security algorithm

257
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:26,925
Speaker 7:  is different from the motion sensing algorithm. The motion sensing algorithm

258
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:31,205
Speaker 7:  actually needs to be more precise. But the security, I

259
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:31,685
Speaker 7:  mean more

260
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:37,285
Speaker 7:  needs to be quicker. It needs to be super fast. Whereas the security algorithm

261
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:41,165
Speaker 7:  doesn't need to be as fast, but it needs to be very accurate.

262
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:45,685
Speaker 7:  'cause you don't want to trigger an alarm for a false alarm. So Yeah.

263
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:49,685
Speaker 7:  And that they're charging for that's a dollar a month or it's

264
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:53,645
Speaker 7:  part of their hue secure system. But yeah, that, so the

265
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,605
Speaker 7:  bridge is doing all that processing of the data that the, the

266
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:01,525
Speaker 7:  radio waves disturbances are sending to the

267
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:05,325
Speaker 7:  bridge and then it decides what's gonna happen, what's

268
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:06,645
Speaker 7:  what's been triggered. Were

269
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:09,725
Speaker 5:  They able to demo any of this for you yet? Yes. Okay. So you actually did,

270
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:13,165
Speaker 5:  you walked in and saw the lights come on. Yes. Like

271
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,205
Speaker 5:  and so, okay, this is my big question. Like how obviously you have to do

272
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,205
Speaker 5:  a lot more testing to see how reliable it is, but like was it, was it fast?

273
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:20,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Was

274
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:23,845
Speaker 7:  It quite Oh yeah, it was very, it was very fast. The, but I didn't get to

275
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:27,765
Speaker 7:  see how long it, so for me, as I mentioned is the it turning off,

276
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:31,605
Speaker 7:  right? Because that's, that's the tricky one. Like I, I get this with my

277
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:35,205
Speaker 7:  spouse all the time. Like the lights turned off on me And I, you know,

278
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:38,205
Speaker 7:  I didn't want them to turn off And I was like, well you weren't moving enough.

279
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,845
Speaker 5:  Oh right. Well this is important 'cause you know, you, you say this in your

280
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:46,605
Speaker 5:  piece, it's motion sensing, it's not presence sensing. Correct. Yes.

281
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,365
Speaker 5:  And So if you are just sitting there, the lights will still turn off on

282
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:51,005
Speaker 7:  You. Yes.

283
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:51,805
Speaker 6:  What about

284
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:53,365
Speaker 7:  Pets? Right? Again, like if

285
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:57,365
Speaker 6:  I have a naughty little kitty who is zooming

286
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:01,285
Speaker 6:  around at 2:00 AM and I'm trying to, I mean I want my kitty

287
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:02,165
Speaker 6:  to see you're doomed.

288
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:06,245
Speaker 7:  They can see in the dark. No, it is, it's just like having

289
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:10,325
Speaker 7:  a PIR sensor in that if, if you have a

290
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:13,685
Speaker 7:  large animal, it will probably trigger it. Like my dog constantly triggers

291
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:17,405
Speaker 7:  my motion sensors, but there is a sensitivity slider

292
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,845
Speaker 7:  like there is with PIR merchant sensors in the app. So you can

293
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:24,725
Speaker 7:  adjust sort of fine tune it for your household.

294
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,445
Speaker 7:  So I mean, I say, and the turning off part is to me

295
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:32,565
Speaker 7:  is quite important because I have often, often have my lights turn off on

296
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:36,445
Speaker 7:  me while I'm still in a room while I'm still doing something. And that's

297
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:40,365
Speaker 7:  very frustrating. So that's the part I, I mean they didn't really demo that

298
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:43,285
Speaker 7:  'cause they're not gonna be like, let's sit here for 10 minutes and wait

299
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:47,005
Speaker 7:  for the lights to turn off. So I'm looking forward to trying that out. So

300
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:47,845
Speaker 7:  just

301
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:51,925
Speaker 6:  Do stretch breaks, do stretches every once in a while and make arm motions

302
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:55,845
Speaker 6:  and Yeah. And you know, the next time you're a smart watch is like, hey,

303
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:58,685
Speaker 6:  you've been sitting too long. You can go like, oh yeah, my life time to me,

304
00:18:58,865 --> 00:18:59,085
Speaker 7:  Me,

305
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,765
Speaker 6:  Me a move around. So maybe this is a

306
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:06,925
Speaker 6:  holistic health and lighting. Shannon, I don't know.

307
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:11,525
Speaker 7:  Or maybe you could have, we could somehow tie in your smartwatch

308
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:15,645
Speaker 7:  to your motion sensing te technology to

309
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:18,165
Speaker 7:  tell you that you are still

310
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:23,405
Speaker 7:  moving a little bit. Because this is something else I saw a lot

311
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:27,285
Speaker 7:  of on the show floor today is a,

312
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:29,165
Speaker 7:  is the sort of holistic home,

313
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:34,525
Speaker 7:  the holistic smart home, everything feeding data into a central

314
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:39,085
Speaker 7:  AI powered system. They don't want to say

315
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:43,485
Speaker 7:  AI agent yet because it's not really agentic, but we, you

316
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:47,365
Speaker 7:  can see that we could be moving to the point where data that

317
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:51,245
Speaker 7:  your home takes in can then

318
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:52,525
Speaker 7:  be processed and,

319
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:58,285
Speaker 7:  and some sort of intelligent decision could be made to predict perhaps

320
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:02,285
Speaker 7:  what you might want to do next or what you might want your

321
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,605
Speaker 7:  home to do next. Like you are getting a bit warm,

322
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:09,605
Speaker 7:  maybe your smartwatch can send that data and your

323
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,485
Speaker 7:  home could decide to turn your AC on for you. I know there's a, there was

324
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:17,445
Speaker 7:  a lot of that, algae had a whole sort of AI home

325
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:20,965
Speaker 7:  booth. They actually had an entire orchestra

326
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:22,965
Speaker 7:  of appliances.

327
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,245
Speaker 5:  Oh my gosh,

328
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:28,725
Speaker 6:  This sounds so much like, what was it? It's just

329
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:31,485
Speaker 6:  fresh on my mind because we just had the Pixel event. But this sounds so

330
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:35,085
Speaker 6:  much like that whole ambient computing thing that Google

331
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:39,005
Speaker 6:  is always on about and just how everything will be invisible. Yes. And

332
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,485
Speaker 6:  you'll have, this is the conspiracy theory. You'll have all these devices

333
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:46,485
Speaker 6:  just feeding data to each other and talking to each other and the AI in

334
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:50,285
Speaker 6:  your home will be the the thread. Yes. Another smart home

335
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:52,165
Speaker 6:  pun to tie it all together.

336
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:57,645
Speaker 6:  And so, you know, it, it really, you know, I think back in the day we're

337
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:01,005
Speaker 6:  like AI ambient computing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But now it's just

338
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:04,525
Speaker 6:  like all starting to fall together

339
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:08,685
Speaker 6:  into the same piece and hearing this, I'm just like, yeah, I want motion

340
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:12,565
Speaker 6:  sensors in my lights would be really cool if it talks to my smart

341
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:16,045
Speaker 6:  watch for those reasons. I mean, I'm sure we could think of a really

342
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:20,005
Speaker 6:  dystopian use case for it like that. I don't know if you saw the Disney

343
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:23,885
Speaker 6:  Channel movie, like about the smart home that goes really

344
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:27,605
Speaker 6:  rogue on the family at one point. But

345
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:31,525
Speaker 6:  you know, I, I think, I think it sounds great. It would be super

346
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,965
Speaker 6:  convenient for me. Like me personally,

347
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:37,845
Speaker 5:  This AI stuff does seem to be like it, this is the next frontier for them,

348
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:41,205
Speaker 5:  right? Yes. That switch bot also had this announcement that they're gonna

349
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:44,885
Speaker 5:  do an AI hub and it seems like all these companies are going,

350
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:48,645
Speaker 5:  okay, we put enough stuff in your home. It's

351
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:52,725
Speaker 5:  kind of complicated, but maybe let, let out, maybe we all mix it

352
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:56,085
Speaker 5:  around with ai. Yeah. Like it turns into something more coherent.

353
00:21:56,475 --> 00:21:59,965
Speaker 5:  Like that's that's the next move. But we're not sure if it works yet.

354
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:03,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah, that's, I think you're right. It's, it's very much about like there

355
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:07,725
Speaker 7:  is so much capability in the smart home tech world today, but

356
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:11,845
Speaker 7:  getting people to actually use those capabilities is, is hard because

357
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:15,645
Speaker 7:  it's a steep learning curve for a lot of things. Even just a motion sensor

358
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:18,525
Speaker 7:  just to, if you went and bought motion sensor and tried to set it up and

359
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:22,325
Speaker 7:  get it to work with your home and your routines, it can be frustrating

360
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:25,645
Speaker 7:  turning the lights on when you don't want it to. Whereas if the home

361
00:22:26,065 --> 00:22:28,685
Speaker 7:  system can manage all of that stuff for you

362
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:33,685
Speaker 7:  and ideally be able to kind of pull in data

363
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:37,565
Speaker 7:  from all parts of your home. Not just necessarily for your comfort but also

364
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,285
Speaker 7:  for convenience, for saving energy for

365
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:45,805
Speaker 7:  safety. Like one of the things this new tech, the sense

366
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:49,725
Speaker 7:  sensing tech can do, could eventually be good enough to sense if

367
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:53,045
Speaker 7:  you fell over. So In theory, you know, your home could basically be

368
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:57,125
Speaker 7:  watching you And I know everyone's going, ah,

369
00:22:57,425 --> 00:23:01,165
Speaker 5:  No, your light, your lights are watching you. It is, it is not creepy. It's

370
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:04,485
Speaker 5:  just merely a totally different appliance that shouldn't be able to see you.

371
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:08,125
Speaker 7:  Right. So that's the, that is the benefit of this sort of ambient sensing.

372
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:12,045
Speaker 7:  But I do see with the AI home bent that

373
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:15,005
Speaker 7:  cameras are going to be a huge part of

374
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:19,245
Speaker 7:  using this ambient home being, being proactive

375
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:23,085
Speaker 7:  because the data that the richness of the data they get from cameras

376
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:27,045
Speaker 7:  versus the data you get from sensors is just a step above.

377
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:31,205
Speaker 7:  And so in terms of like, so Switch bots example, they release their

378
00:23:31,465 --> 00:23:35,285
Speaker 7:  ai AI hub and they have a couple cameras

379
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:39,405
Speaker 7:  that you can use inside or inside the home. They have one pan and tilt camera

380
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:43,285
Speaker 7:  and they have a video doorbell and they are, they were sort of pitching

381
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:47,245
Speaker 7:  it like we can, we can see when you, you know, where you've left your

382
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:49,885
Speaker 7:  phone because we are watching you in the home.

383
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:51,285
Speaker 5:  Okay. That's a good feature.

384
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:55,405
Speaker 7:  And then when you can't find your phone, you say, Hey, switch

385
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:58,245
Speaker 7:  bot, where's my phone? And they'll be like, you left it in the bathroom,

386
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:00,725
Speaker 7:  we don't wanna camera the bathroom. Then you're three

387
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:04,565
Speaker 5:  Robot vacuums go and crawl up to the bathroom

388
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:07,645
Speaker 5:  and grab it with their arm and bring it back to you.

389
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,645
Speaker 7:  Yes. There you go. You've solved it.

390
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:11,245
Speaker 5:  It's all coming together.

391
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:15,725
Speaker 6:  That sounds so cool and so scary at the same time. I know like, just like

392
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:19,765
Speaker 6:  equal parts, like the idea of having cameras in every part

393
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:23,565
Speaker 6:  of my home watching me, like when you say like, oh it'll tell you where your

394
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:26,565
Speaker 6:  phone is. I'm like, I need that. 'cause I'm constantly dinging the thing

395
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,525
Speaker 6:  at All Points in time and you know, you're finding the sound, but your cat's

396
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:34,445
Speaker 6:  sitting on it so the sound isn't accurate. That sort of thing. Air

397
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:37,605
Speaker 6:  tags don't work well through floors and all of that stuff. So that

398
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:41,525
Speaker 6:  personally, this is all just personally in my life I would love that. But

399
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:44,245
Speaker 6:  at the same time, I don't know, I don't want

400
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:48,165
Speaker 7:  A camera in the cameras. My bathroom. Yeah, I I mean the cameras, you know,

401
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:51,525
Speaker 7:  ideally though the yeah, you wouldn't do, but if you have a camera at the

402
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:54,445
Speaker 7:  front door, maybe you have a camera at the back door, maybe you have one

403
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:57,885
Speaker 7:  in the hallway and then the other sensors could help for

404
00:24:58,545 --> 00:24:59,805
Speaker 7:  you know, the bathroom stuff.

405
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:05,325
Speaker 7:  But yeah, there's got to be a way to kind of pull all of this together where

406
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:08,885
Speaker 7:  it feels private and secure. And this was something that Switch Bot was focusing

407
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:12,725
Speaker 7:  on too, because their hub was entirely local, but they were also using

408
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:17,525
Speaker 7:  vision learning. So machine vision learning, which

409
00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:21,575
Speaker 7:  is, has to use the cloud because it's such a high

410
00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:25,375
Speaker 7:  processing, you know, it requires a lot of processing

411
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:29,055
Speaker 7:  power, which the hub can't do. And you would have to pay a monthly

412
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:32,615
Speaker 7:  fee for those types of things. I can see more and more companies doing that.

413
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:36,735
Speaker 7:  So using the AI for what the home sees

414
00:25:36,795 --> 00:25:40,695
Speaker 7:  in strategic areas so that, that it can then, you know,

415
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:44,295
Speaker 7:  so say I've lost my cat, it will know that the, it saw the cat

416
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:48,375
Speaker 7:  leave through the front door because someone left the door open or, but then

417
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:52,575
Speaker 7:  the personal data can be more like wearables or sensors

418
00:25:52,575 --> 00:25:56,535
Speaker 7:  in the bedroom or the bathroom. But the key is tying it all

419
00:25:56,735 --> 00:26:00,415
Speaker 7:  together. Yeah. And right now everything is so disparate.

420
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:04,215
Speaker 7:  Each company is like, you can use all of our appliances, like that's

421
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:07,335
Speaker 7:  LG with its appliance orchestra. It's like, look, we can make all of these

422
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:10,415
Speaker 7:  work together, But that means I have to have everything from LG or I have

423
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:14,055
Speaker 7:  to have everything from Samsung or everything from Switch bot. So

424
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:17,415
Speaker 7:  that next level is how do we bring all of this together

425
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:21,815
Speaker 5:  And how, how much is matter and thread helping with stuff like, like is

426
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:22,615
Speaker 5:  it's a promise

427
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:24,895
Speaker 7:  It could nothing at the moment.

428
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:28,695
Speaker 5:  It could Yes, could, could is is an important word. Yes.

429
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:32,775
Speaker 7:  I mean it's, that's one of the reasons for matter is so that

430
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:36,015
Speaker 7:  we could have this more, it's an open standard.

431
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:40,455
Speaker 7:  It provides the platform for the technology

432
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:44,205
Speaker 7:  to talk to each other. So you could then bring in a

433
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:47,925
Speaker 7:  Samsung AI home or LGS Faron

434
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:52,005
Speaker 7:  agent as they call it, and or switch bot hub

435
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:56,125
Speaker 7:  or something else to connect into the data

436
00:26:56,275 --> 00:27:00,245
Speaker 7:  that matter provides. So you wouldn't necess so matter being any

437
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:03,885
Speaker 7:  device can work with any platform

438
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:08,085
Speaker 7:  no matter who made it. So you're not locked into proprietary

439
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:12,085
Speaker 7:  ecosystems. And that's really the foundation of that was the

440
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:16,005
Speaker 7:  point of creating matter. So yes, you can see that this could

441
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:20,365
Speaker 7:  help create that foundation. And then the, the fight

442
00:27:20,465 --> 00:27:24,325
Speaker 7:  now the arms race is who becomes the brain of your home because that is

443
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:28,125
Speaker 7:  gonna be someone you have to pick. Is it Google? Is it Apple? Is it

444
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:31,205
Speaker 7:  Alexa, is it lg? Is it Amazon or is it Switch bot?

445
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:35,605
Speaker 6:  It's just like, I I put up a story over the weekend about how

446
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:40,005
Speaker 6:  when I talked to Google, they were basically selling the same idea

447
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:43,925
Speaker 6:  about how the ambient computing world is gonna happen

448
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:47,885
Speaker 6:  and AI is just gonna be the glue that keeps all of these devices

449
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:51,325
Speaker 6:  talking to each other and together. So if you win the AI battle

450
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:55,845
Speaker 6:  and your, in Google's case, Gemini is the, the bot that

451
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:59,725
Speaker 6:  everybody chooses. Yeah. Then in some ways, like

452
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:03,445
Speaker 6:  AI is strengthening the product

453
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:07,765
Speaker 6:  ecosystem. It's like built, it's like putting putty and

454
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:11,925
Speaker 6:  strengthening the walled gardens as opposed to tearing it down in

455
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:12,725
Speaker 6:  some way. I

456
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:16,645
Speaker 7:  Think for the flagship products, definitely yeah, for the phone, the speaker,

457
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:21,085
Speaker 7:  the watch. But where it's democratized, you know, so

458
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:25,045
Speaker 7:  it makes buying a light bulb, a $15 hue light bulb

459
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:29,285
Speaker 7:  now much more approachable or a motion sensor or a present sensor.

460
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:33,805
Speaker 7:  You know, we saw some cool new present sensors at, in at, on the

461
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:37,685
Speaker 7:  show floor today or a door lock, you know, all of that now

462
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:41,485
Speaker 7:  doesn't have to be from one company. That's where you get

463
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:44,525
Speaker 7:  much more of the democracy and being able to

464
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:49,285
Speaker 7:  choose what you want to make your home work. But yes, I think the

465
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:53,245
Speaker 7:  flagship products you are gonna be feel locked in. So 20

466
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:57,205
Speaker 7:  minutes of Samsung's keynote today was all about

467
00:28:57,665 --> 00:29:01,605
Speaker 7:  AI home. So at CES they called it Home ai, but now

468
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:04,245
Speaker 7:  they've rebranded and it's now AI Home.

469
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:06,485
Speaker 6:  It's like, oh,

470
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,005
Speaker 7:  Thinking outside the box there.

471
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:13,645
Speaker 7:  And it's, yeah, they, it's was all about the Galaxy watch, the Galaxy

472
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:16,285
Speaker 7:  phone, Samsung Food, which is their

473
00:29:17,395 --> 00:29:20,965
Speaker 7:  meal planning, health, healthy eating resp system

474
00:29:21,705 --> 00:29:25,245
Speaker 7:  app, and then smart things. So bringing all of their pieces

475
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:28,365
Speaker 7:  together to sort of lock you into that ecosystem. They don't really care

476
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,085
Speaker 7:  which smart bulbs you buy.

477
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:33,485
Speaker 5:  So Jen, I know the show hasn't even technically started yet, but is there

478
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,725
Speaker 5:  anything else tomorrow else we should Tomorrow

479
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:36,285

00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:39,525
Speaker 5:  My gosh. Today. Well, as this is airing, the show has started. Just started

481
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:43,965
Speaker 5:  for you personally. Well it, it's, it's really No, but

482
00:29:44,345 --> 00:29:48,125
Speaker 5:  is there anything else we should be looking forward to throughout efa or

483
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:51,965
Speaker 5:  is it just gonna be Ai Ai what, what, you know, what's next?

484
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:52,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I

485
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:53,325
Speaker 7:  Think more robots.

486
00:29:53,985 --> 00:29:54,405
Speaker 5:  Robots

487
00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:57,205
Speaker 7:  Always, we always get excited about robots. Always. Yeah. There's, there's,

488
00:29:57,205 --> 00:30:00,925
Speaker 7:  there's some interesting, I did get to play with a robot pet

489
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:03,125
Speaker 7:  today, which was quite, it was cute. I love,

490
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:04,045
Speaker 5:  I love the

491
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:05,205
Speaker 7:  Weird pets. The weird pets.

492
00:30:05,205 --> 00:30:06,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The pets are so good.

493
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:10,445
Speaker 7:  Yeah. LG has its weird little baby in a bowl pet

494
00:30:10,445 --> 00:30:12,565
Speaker 7:  that it had at CES here. Do you remember that thing?

495
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:13,205
Speaker 5:  No, that's okay.

496
00:30:13,385 --> 00:30:16,245
Speaker 6:  Was it the Maro? What? I can't remember it was it Maro what it was called?

497
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:17,805
Speaker 6:  It was like a Japanese one. But

498
00:30:17,965 --> 00:30:21,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah, so that's here. And there's also Switchboard has

499
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,965
Speaker 7:  its AI pet And I saw to, I saw like anime

500
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,725
Speaker 7:  holograms in like a, in a like a

501
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:30,285
Speaker 7:  canister.

502
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:32,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's meant to be

503
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:35,645
Speaker 7:  A pet. Lots of lots of companion

504
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:39,405
Speaker 5:  Type things. It's time to shut down Iffa. We have gone too far.

505
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:43,965
Speaker 7:  It was like an anime character and, and they were like, yes, it's your companion.

506
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:47,405
Speaker 7:  Like, oh, my daughter loves anime And I got a bit closer. I'm like, I don't

507
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:48,845
Speaker 7:  think this is for her. No.

508
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:51,005
Speaker 5:  Was it

509
00:30:51,005 --> 00:30:51,685
Speaker 6:  Like anime

510
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:52,845
Speaker 7:  Boy? It was Pink

511
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:56,845
Speaker 6:  Cchu anime? No, no, no. Or was it, was it like Elon Musk? Annie

512
00:30:57,295 --> 00:31:00,045
Speaker 6:  Anime? Oh no. Yeah. Oh no.

513
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:05,325
Speaker 7:  So yeah, and then there's another robot with an arm that can throw tennis

514
00:31:05,455 --> 00:31:06,845
Speaker 7:  balls for,

515
00:31:06,905 --> 00:31:07,125
Speaker 5:  For

516
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,645
Speaker 6:  Dog. No, that's, that's better. You know, that's better. Yeah. Yeah.

517
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:10,205
Speaker 7:  And I

518
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:11,445
Speaker 6:  Think I love that robot. Yeah,

519
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:15,205
Speaker 7:  So there's, there's lots of fun robots, lots of appliances. I always get

520
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:19,165
Speaker 7:  excited about appliances. I know, that's sweet. And I

521
00:31:19,165 --> 00:31:21,925
Speaker 7:  think there's laptops too, in case people are interested in those.

522
00:31:22,245 --> 00:31:25,605
Speaker 5:  Awesome. Well, I'm, I'm very excited. Everyone should stay tuned to The Verge

523
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:29,565
Speaker 5:  dot com. We're gonna have a lot more. Jen, thank you so much for hopping

524
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:33,525
Speaker 5:  on to tell us all about if a, I'll let you get back to the, the

525
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:35,885
Speaker 5:  Wild Show at in Berlin.

526
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:37,125
Speaker 7:  Thank you.

527
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:40,885
Speaker 5:  Alright, we've gotta take a break. When we're back, we're gonna have Lauren

528
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:43,325
Speaker 5:  Finer talking about the Google Antitrust ruling

529
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:22,325
Speaker 9:  filed under the first Trump administration. And then,

530
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:26,205
Speaker 9:  you know, in last August the judge

531
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:29,845
Speaker 9:  finally said that Google is a monopoly in online

532
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:33,725
Speaker 9:  search. And that was a huge landmark ruling, the first

533
00:35:33,785 --> 00:35:37,765
Speaker 9:  of these big tech cases by the government. And then there

534
00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:41,325
Speaker 9:  was all this anticipation of like, okay, what is he gonna do to

535
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:45,365
Speaker 9:  make sure that Google can no longer have this, you know, power grip

536
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:49,165
Speaker 9:  over this industry? And that leads us up to

537
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:53,365
Speaker 9:  this past week when the judge finally issued

538
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:57,245
Speaker 9:  his ruling and said basically Google can't do

539
00:35:57,715 --> 00:36:01,325
Speaker 9:  some contracts, some certain terms in their contracts

540
00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:05,205
Speaker 9:  and they have to share some data to help search competitors

541
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:09,365
Speaker 9:  get up to speed with them. But basically rejected the largest

542
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:13,365
Speaker 9:  of the DOJs proposals of how to restore

543
00:36:13,365 --> 00:36:14,845
Speaker 9:  competition to this market,

544
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:19,205
Speaker 5:  Right? The DOJ like swung for the fences. And they had these, these

545
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:23,125
Speaker 5:  pretty big asks that that I think the most famous

546
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:26,965
Speaker 5:  of them was trying to get force Google to sell Chrome.

547
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:30,885
Speaker 5:  And then like everyone was coming out of the woodwork trying to buy Chrome

548
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:34,765
Speaker 5:  even though it wasn't for sale yet. And the judge is just like, no,

549
00:36:34,765 --> 00:36:38,485
Speaker 5:  that's absolutely not happening. He, he said the government really overreached

550
00:36:38,485 --> 00:36:42,205
Speaker 5:  too by, by trying to get them to, as a backup maybe

551
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:43,405
Speaker 5:  have to sell Android.

552
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:48,445
Speaker 5:  Most of the big asks just didn't happen here. And I think most of the big

553
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:52,325
Speaker 5:  asks just didn't happen here, right? Like the DOJ didn't get most of what

554
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:53,085
Speaker 5:  they were asking for.

555
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:57,245
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I think you could definitely look at

556
00:36:57,245 --> 00:37:00,965
Speaker 9:  this and say, hey, the DOJ swung for the fences,

557
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:05,605
Speaker 9:  you know, put out all of these really big ideas of how to fix this market.

558
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:10,245
Speaker 9:  And it probably wasn't going to get all of them, but I think

559
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:14,565
Speaker 9:  it was surprising the extent to which they

560
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,125
Speaker 9:  didn't get so much of what they wanted. You know, the judge really

561
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:22,005
Speaker 9:  didn't go all that much farther beyond what Google had

562
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:25,645
Speaker 9:  conceded to. And in some ways having watched

563
00:37:26,095 --> 00:37:29,725
Speaker 9:  Judge MEA throughout both the liability phase

564
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:33,845
Speaker 9:  and the remedies phase trials, you know, you could see that

565
00:37:33,845 --> 00:37:37,725
Speaker 9:  he was really grappling with what to do here. He's the first out of the

566
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:41,325
Speaker 9:  gate with one of these rulings in this kind of new era

567
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:45,365
Speaker 9:  of tech antitrust reform. And he

568
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:49,005
Speaker 9:  really was, seemed very cautious about, you know,

569
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:53,005
Speaker 9:  not wanting to create a new problem and disrupt something

570
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,965
Speaker 9:  that's, you know, already set in motion.

571
00:37:55,595 --> 00:37:59,405
Speaker 5:  Well, it's really interesting in his opinion this week

572
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:03,445
Speaker 5:  he goes into the fact that AI changed

573
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:08,565
Speaker 5:  how he ended up making this decision. The fact

574
00:38:08,595 --> 00:38:12,525
Speaker 5:  that AI is now seen as a competitor search

575
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:17,285
Speaker 5:  made him, I think, a little bit more cautious in what he did. Here he has

576
00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:21,125
Speaker 5:  this one quote, he says, quote, much has

577
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:24,965
Speaker 5:  changed since the end of the liability trial. Artificial intelligence

578
00:38:24,965 --> 00:38:28,845
Speaker 5:  technologies, particularly generative AI may yet prove to be game changers.

579
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:33,205
Speaker 5:  And then he just says like, flat out the emergence of gen AI changed

580
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:36,885
Speaker 5:  the course of this case. And so there is this real thing here where

581
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,005
Speaker 5:  I think possibly we could have gotten a much

582
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:45,245
Speaker 5:  stronger version of these remedies against Google, but

583
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:49,085
Speaker 5:  for the first time in decades, the first time maybe ever Google

584
00:38:49,525 --> 00:38:53,205
Speaker 5:  actually is seeing some material competition. And I

585
00:38:53,485 --> 00:38:57,445
Speaker 5:  think, you know, v you just did a whole Vergecast episode on this

586
00:38:57,855 --> 00:39:01,435
Speaker 5:  about people's use for ai and

587
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:03,115
Speaker 5:  search is one of the big ones now,

588
00:39:03,555 --> 00:39:06,755
Speaker 6:  I mean for like, you And I talk pretty heavily about using

589
00:39:07,575 --> 00:39:11,035
Speaker 6:  AI for search because, sorry, Google's, your search

590
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:15,275
Speaker 6:  kind sucks now, like it's so weird because on

591
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:19,235
Speaker 6:  the one hand we use Google, the way that we use the

592
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:22,755
Speaker 6:  word Kleenex to mean tissues, right? Google just means go search something

593
00:39:22,755 --> 00:39:26,395
Speaker 6:  on the internet that's in our vernacular that pretty much would make you

594
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:30,195
Speaker 6:  think that, hey, this is a monopoly because we don't say, oh

595
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:34,035
Speaker 6:  go Yahoo, that thing, right? We, we say go Google that thing, but

596
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,915
Speaker 6:  to our, our vergecast discussion,

597
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:42,155
Speaker 6:  it's not good enough anymore because all of the SEO slop

598
00:39:42,575 --> 00:39:45,835
Speaker 6:  has just changed that game. So it's sort of like, oh,

599
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:50,515
Speaker 6:  once again, because I've been watching Law and Order And I had to have

600
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:54,675
Speaker 6:  perplexity tell me what season it was that Fin tu toola cuts off his

601
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:55,195
Speaker 6:  ponytail.

602
00:39:56,865 --> 00:40:00,715
Speaker 6:  Like AI was actually able to tell me like it told me a wrong answer and

603
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:03,715
Speaker 6:  someone called me out online and then I looked it up again and then it told

604
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:06,355
Speaker 6:  me the right answer. So you do have to kind of handhold it a little bit,

605
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:09,955
Speaker 6:  but it's still telling you what's more likely to be

606
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:14,835
Speaker 6:  a, an answer when your traditional Google search isn't

607
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:18,515
Speaker 6:  gonna help you anymore. I had a situation this morning where my fridge

608
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:22,795
Speaker 6:  was, the ice maker was spitting out clay balls And I was like, what?

609
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,875
Speaker 6:  What is here happening

610
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:24,595
Speaker 5:  Here? I'm concerned

611
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:28,475
Speaker 6:  About that. I'm very concerned. Why is my ice maker spinning out clay

612
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:32,315
Speaker 6:  balls? And then I asked, and Google was not giving me any

613
00:40:32,315 --> 00:40:35,995
Speaker 6:  answers and so I asked AI and they're like, well this is either a sediment

614
00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:39,835
Speaker 6:  issue and you're just gonna have to do a, a lot of work or something's wrong

615
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:44,035
Speaker 6:  with your, with your thing, and why don't you just empty out the

616
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:47,275
Speaker 6:  ice bucket? And I was like, oh, I can empty out the ice bucket new homeowner

617
00:40:47,275 --> 00:40:50,555
Speaker 6:  here. I've never had to do appliance maintenance before. And I found out

618
00:40:50,555 --> 00:40:54,235
Speaker 6:  that my spouse had put an eye mask with clay balls in them in the ice maker.

619
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:54,635
Speaker 6:  Oh

620
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:55,155
Speaker 5:  My God.

621
00:40:55,155 --> 00:40:58,715
Speaker 6:  It had opened up a hole and that's why clay balls were coming out of my ice

622
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:03,355
Speaker 6:  maker. So I was like, I didn't gimme the right answer in this

623
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:07,515
Speaker 6:  situation, but it did kind of put me on a path that got me to the right

624
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:11,395
Speaker 6:  answer for a search and a question that I had, whereas just typing

625
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:15,355
Speaker 6:  it into Google did nothing for me. So it's

626
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:19,275
Speaker 6:  like a really, I, I get where the judge is coming from, but also I'm

627
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:21,395
Speaker 6:  like, come on man.

628
00:41:22,615 --> 00:41:26,475
Speaker 5:  It is one of those ultra specific things. I, I, again,

629
00:41:26,595 --> 00:41:29,475
Speaker 5:  I did the exact same thing. This I was trying to look up, do you remember

630
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:32,755
Speaker 5:  the chat app Trillian? I just like, I was like, how do I search for

631
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:37,765
Speaker 5:  a chat app that was popular in 2006 with a weird like Infinity logo

632
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:41,965
Speaker 5:  and it was just right. Like I I can't Google that, but, but you're right.

633
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:45,885
Speaker 5:  Like it, it's, it is, it is pretty remarkable that if this

634
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:49,925
Speaker 5:  remedies trial had been held a y probably

635
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:53,605
Speaker 5:  a year earlier, certainly two years earlier, we may have ended up in a very

636
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:57,245
Speaker 5:  different outcome because Google, it, it, it seemed

637
00:41:57,555 --> 00:42:00,205
Speaker 5:  kind of borderline impossible that Google would see material

638
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:05,165
Speaker 5:  challenge to its dominance in the search industry. So I'm just gonna read

639
00:42:05,165 --> 00:42:08,925
Speaker 5:  out, I I think a, a quick TLDR of how I'm seeing

640
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:12,525
Speaker 5:  the, the things that they actually have to do. And Lauren, you can tell me

641
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:16,485
Speaker 5:  if this is is about correct, but here's, here's what the

642
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:20,325
Speaker 5:  judge is going to require of Google, assuming that this sticks. The

643
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:23,765
Speaker 5:  judge says that Google has to stop making exclusivity contracts

644
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:28,085
Speaker 5:  for products like Search Chrome and Gemini. So they can still

645
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:31,845
Speaker 5:  make default contracts, but they can't say it's the, the exclusive provider

646
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:35,565
Speaker 5:  of those things. Google has to stop tying some of their

647
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:39,245
Speaker 5:  apps to the placement or use of other

648
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:42,165
Speaker 5:  apps on their devices. So they can't be like, if you want Gmail,

649
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:46,965
Speaker 5:  you have to use Chrome. If you want Gmail, you have to use Gemini.

650
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:50,485
Speaker 5:  They can't do that anymore. They're gonna have to syndicate

651
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:54,805
Speaker 5:  some of their search results. And that's like with an asterisk, there's like

652
00:42:54,845 --> 00:42:58,485
Speaker 5:  a, a big subset there and they have to share some of their search

653
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:02,445
Speaker 5:  index. Is is that about right? Like it's it's a lot of like half measures

654
00:43:02,445 --> 00:43:02,605
Speaker 5:  here.

655
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:06,685
Speaker 9:  That's right. And he leaves open some possibility that he

656
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:10,485
Speaker 9:  could expand some of this in the future. For example, if, you know, he

657
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:14,725
Speaker 9:  finds that, you know, these remedies aren't actually enough to

658
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:18,565
Speaker 9:  restore competition, maybe he will look back on the payments part of

659
00:43:18,565 --> 00:43:22,405
Speaker 9:  this or something like that. So there's some options here, but that's basically

660
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:26,285
Speaker 9:  the extent of what Google has to do if these remedies hold up.

661
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:29,245
Speaker 5:  Well and actually we should touch on the payments part because that was a

662
00:43:29,385 --> 00:43:33,325
Speaker 5:  big thing at issue here and he's, he thinks, ah, they're fine, right?

663
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:37,085
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I mean I, I don't know if he necessarily would say, oh this is totally

664
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:41,085
Speaker 9:  fine. I think throughout the trial, even the liability phase and the remedies

665
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,885
Speaker 9:  phase we saw, you know, he really felt like the fact that

666
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:48,845
Speaker 9:  Google was paying Apple, you know, $20 billion

667
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:53,125
Speaker 9:  to be the default search provider on

668
00:43:53,445 --> 00:43:57,085
Speaker 9:  Safari was pretty indicative that, you know, they,

669
00:43:57,675 --> 00:44:01,085
Speaker 9:  they felt like they needed to hold onto this position even though

670
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:05,285
Speaker 9:  they keep saying that they're the best. And so he

671
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:09,205
Speaker 9:  really seemed to kind of hang on to that fact throughout

672
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:12,485
Speaker 9:  the trial, but at the same time I think he heard from

673
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:16,925
Speaker 9:  both Eddie Q from Apple and an executive from

674
00:44:17,165 --> 00:44:20,605
Speaker 9:  Mozilla who said, you know, we're, we would basically be pure

675
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:24,605
Speaker 9:  losers here if you decide that we can't get

676
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:27,885
Speaker 9:  these payments from Google because Google is still

677
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,765
Speaker 9:  dominant people, our customers are still gonna wanna go to Google

678
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:36,245
Speaker 9:  and we have to provide that option and yet we'll no longer be able to be

679
00:44:36,245 --> 00:44:39,925
Speaker 9:  paid for it. So I think that was something that he really

680
00:44:40,065 --> 00:44:43,965
Speaker 9:  wanted to consider here and probably drove some of his thinking around

681
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:46,685
Speaker 9:  whether Google could be able to make these payments. It's

682
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:50,285
Speaker 5:  Really fascinating. You know, I think the critics of Google

683
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:54,525
Speaker 5:  are, are pretty upset about this ruling. They think that it's not going to

684
00:44:54,665 --> 00:44:58,485
Speaker 5:  go far enough, at least from what I've seen. But as I was

685
00:44:58,485 --> 00:45:02,445
Speaker 5:  reading the opinion, you know, you do sort of like see how the

686
00:45:02,445 --> 00:45:05,925
Speaker 5:  judge landed here and you start to feel for him in terms of the, the

687
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:09,765
Speaker 5:  challenge of threading this needle because you look at the,

688
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:13,445
Speaker 5:  the payments, which were one of the big things at issue here and it's like,

689
00:45:14,235 --> 00:45:17,525
Speaker 5:  okay, so may maybe you say, you know what, it is bad for Google to be able

690
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:21,405
Speaker 5:  to pay to be the default and therefore crowded everybody else. And then

691
00:45:21,405 --> 00:45:24,965
Speaker 5:  you think from the judge's point of view, okay, does it help Google or hurt

692
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:28,285
Speaker 5:  Google if I ban them from paying Apple

693
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:31,965
Speaker 5:  $20 billion a year? But Apple sets Google as a default

694
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:35,845
Speaker 5:  search anyway because Google's the best product. Does it help Google or hurt

695
00:45:35,845 --> 00:45:39,365
Speaker 5:  Google if I ban them from paying Mozilla a bunch of money and then

696
00:45:39,595 --> 00:45:43,365
Speaker 5:  Firefox dies and even more people have to use Chrome and you just keep

697
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:47,325
Speaker 5:  going through these things and it's like, oh, like he, this

698
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:50,925
Speaker 5:  is, this is kind of tough. Like how do you make space for

699
00:45:50,955 --> 00:45:54,845
Speaker 5:  competitors without actually hurting the

700
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:58,485
Speaker 5:  rest of the industry at the same time because all of these companies

701
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:01,925
Speaker 5:  are just hooked on Google's money and Google,

702
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:07,045
Speaker 5:  you know, saving them a bunch of cash would actually be a

703
00:46:07,075 --> 00:46:08,285
Speaker 5:  perk for them in some ways.

704
00:46:08,835 --> 00:46:12,685
Speaker 9:  Yeah, definitely. I think, you know, judge Maja talks a lot

705
00:46:12,685 --> 00:46:16,485
Speaker 9:  about, you know, judicial humility and you know, not wanting

706
00:46:16,505 --> 00:46:20,365
Speaker 9:  to kind of take proactive action that will cause more harm

707
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:24,405
Speaker 9:  or disruption or, you know, pretend that he can know the future.

708
00:46:25,705 --> 00:46:29,685
Speaker 9:  But at the same time I think critics of this decision

709
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:33,925
Speaker 9:  are saying, you know, he really didn't go far enough and we already,

710
00:46:34,065 --> 00:46:37,205
Speaker 9:  he already found that there's this issue in this market

711
00:46:37,955 --> 00:46:41,285
Speaker 9:  that revolves around how Google has conducted itself

712
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:46,285
Speaker 9:  and you know, a lot of these critics feel like he hasn't gone far enough

713
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:50,165
Speaker 9:  and instead did a sort of half measure that says they

714
00:46:50,165 --> 00:46:54,045
Speaker 9:  can't have these exclusivity in their contracts, but they can keep paying

715
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:58,165
Speaker 9:  heaps of money to be the defaults. Which, you know, already he's kind of

716
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:02,045
Speaker 9:  found that the defaults act as a way that Google has

717
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:03,965
Speaker 9:  been able to maintain its monopoly power.

718
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:08,405
Speaker 6:  So a question I have is like a lot of times with law, and

719
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:12,445
Speaker 6:  one thing that I've learned just serving in unions is that you can want all

720
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:16,285
Speaker 6:  of these ambitions things, but you really have to think about enforceability,

721
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:19,885
Speaker 6:  right? Like when you decide you're gonna do things a new way and you're like,

722
00:47:19,885 --> 00:47:23,645
Speaker 6:  Hey, what if we do it this way? I think one of the challenges that I

723
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:27,125
Speaker 6:  learned about was how implementable is it

724
00:47:27,605 --> 00:47:31,525
Speaker 6:  actually? So are the things that he's, you know, asking

725
00:47:32,465 --> 00:47:36,235
Speaker 6:  Google to do it, are these things that

726
00:47:36,795 --> 00:47:40,435
Speaker 6:  materially make a difference? Are these things that the government can

727
00:47:40,435 --> 00:47:43,835
Speaker 6:  enforce or is it just sort of like we said that they're doing this here,

728
00:47:45,415 --> 00:47:47,835
Speaker 6:  but actually it's a status quo?

729
00:47:48,385 --> 00:47:51,795
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I mean I think that's kind of the reason why the Justice Department

730
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:55,635
Speaker 9:  was pushing for a breakup or what they'd call

731
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:59,715
Speaker 9:  structural remedies in the first place is that, you know, a lot of people

732
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:02,635
Speaker 9:  who advocate for those kinds of remedies say they're the easiest to enforce

733
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:06,315
Speaker 9:  because you don't have to monitor it, you don't have to babysit a company,

734
00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:10,635
Speaker 9:  you just break 'em up. You just say CR Chrome can

735
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:14,195
Speaker 9:  no longer be owned by Google and they have to sell it and they have to break

736
00:48:14,195 --> 00:48:17,755
Speaker 9:  it apart. And obviously that's easier said than done,

737
00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:21,515
Speaker 9:  but you know, once it's done, it's done these

738
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:25,475
Speaker 9:  behavioral remedies like, you know, having to,

739
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:30,635
Speaker 9:  you know, not put certain provisions in their contracts or share certain

740
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:34,715
Speaker 9:  search data. That's something that kind of does have to

741
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:38,395
Speaker 9:  be monitored for compliance a little bit more. But,

742
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:42,875
Speaker 9:  you know, I think in this case it doesn't seem like so hard to

743
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:46,595
Speaker 9:  do that, but I guess the devil will be in the details

744
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:50,795
Speaker 9:  of how they're, you know, they have to do that if, you know, they

745
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:51,675
Speaker 9:  actually get to that point.

746
00:48:52,415 --> 00:48:56,195
Speaker 5:  So the, the thing that I think is a little tricky here is I, I sort of

747
00:48:56,215 --> 00:48:59,675
Speaker 5:  see how he lands at we can't ban these payments

748
00:49:00,495 --> 00:49:04,475
Speaker 5:  as for Ali lands at the rest of the remedies and what

749
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:08,395
Speaker 5:  is required of Google to create competition. It gets

750
00:49:08,435 --> 00:49:11,435
Speaker 5:  a little more complicated I think because he, he actually carves this like

751
00:49:11,435 --> 00:49:15,075
Speaker 5:  pretty narrow path And I don't know that this path is necessarily

752
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:19,475
Speaker 5:  tied to the ways that Google created its monopoly and

753
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:22,955
Speaker 5:  enforced its monopoly. And I think that's what a lot of the remedies were

754
00:49:22,955 --> 00:49:26,555
Speaker 5:  about, right? The remedies were Chrome enables

755
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:30,035
Speaker 5:  Google's monopoly, so we will remove Chrome. Android

756
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:34,275
Speaker 5:  enables Google's monopoly and so we'll, we'll threaten to remove Android.

757
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:39,185
Speaker 5:  And kind of as I see it, what he's doing instead is saying,

758
00:49:39,645 --> 00:49:43,265
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna create a little narrow path that will allow more

759
00:49:43,265 --> 00:49:47,065
Speaker 5:  competition to bubble up. You're saying that the problem is that Google

760
00:49:47,205 --> 00:49:51,145
Speaker 5:  has such a lead in search that no one else can catch up and compete

761
00:49:51,145 --> 00:49:54,785
Speaker 5:  with them. So I'm gonna give you some basic tools so that these other

762
00:49:55,065 --> 00:49:58,545
Speaker 5:  companies can bubble up and start to create competition. And

763
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:02,505
Speaker 5:  from my read of the opinion, he, he's basically

764
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:06,265
Speaker 5:  saying, listen all you other companies, you can have basically

765
00:50:06,665 --> 00:50:10,455
Speaker 5:  a, a map of what Google is doing and, and

766
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:13,455
Speaker 5:  that's kind of it, right? You, we'll we'll give you some, some supporting

767
00:50:13,455 --> 00:50:16,695
Speaker 5:  stuff. So you'll have a map, like the search index is essentially a map of

768
00:50:16,695 --> 00:50:20,015
Speaker 5:  the internet to let them understand what Google is indexing.

769
00:50:20,445 --> 00:50:24,415
Speaker 5:  They're gonna get some basic search syndication, but they can only

770
00:50:24,415 --> 00:50:28,245
Speaker 5:  syndicate up to like 40% of their, of their search from Google.

771
00:50:29,865 --> 00:50:33,765
Speaker 5:  And that's supposed to sort of help bootstrap them. But the judge is

772
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:37,605
Speaker 5:  pretty blunt about from there you gotta do it

773
00:50:37,845 --> 00:50:41,445
Speaker 5:  yourself. You can't keep going back to Google and getting more information

774
00:50:41,445 --> 00:50:44,525
Speaker 5:  about how they build their search engine. You need to invest and you need

775
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:48,485
Speaker 5:  to build a good product, you need to, to compete with them, which is

776
00:50:48,485 --> 00:50:50,965
Speaker 5:  still a pretty big ask of the, of the industry.

777
00:50:51,195 --> 00:50:54,925
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I think it's important to know that, you know, in antitrust law when

778
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:58,565
Speaker 9:  it comes to remedy is, you know, the goal here is not, you know,

779
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:02,885
Speaker 9:  let's undo every anti-competitive thing that Google did up until this point.

780
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:06,165
Speaker 9:  'cause some of them maybe, are I relevant to the market at this point?

781
00:51:06,825 --> 00:51:10,805
Speaker 9:  The goal is to restore competition to the market that Google has

782
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:14,685
Speaker 9:  monopolized. So, you know, I think the

783
00:51:14,685 --> 00:51:18,365
Speaker 9:  goal with these remedies is basically to make it so that,

784
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:22,525
Speaker 9:  you know, rivals really can compete in this market in a way they haven't

785
00:51:22,525 --> 00:51:26,405
Speaker 9:  been able to in, in, you know, decades based

786
00:51:26,405 --> 00:51:30,245
Speaker 9:  on Judge Mata's ruling. So basically

787
00:51:30,315 --> 00:51:33,805
Speaker 9:  they, he is implementing all of this to say,

788
00:51:34,075 --> 00:51:37,965
Speaker 9:  okay, let's give some of these rivals kind of a jumpstart

789
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:42,445
Speaker 9:  in the way that they haven't been able to do that in

790
00:51:42,445 --> 00:51:46,285
Speaker 9:  years. Because basically delivering valuable search

791
00:51:46,285 --> 00:51:50,245
Speaker 9:  results requires a lot of data, collecting a lot of data requires a lot

792
00:51:50,245 --> 00:51:54,005
Speaker 9:  of users coming to your service and putting in a lot of queries. And

793
00:51:54,185 --> 00:51:57,565
Speaker 9:  if Google is gobbling all those up, then no other company is really getting

794
00:51:57,565 --> 00:52:01,245
Speaker 9:  that. So the goal is to kind of give these other

795
00:52:01,525 --> 00:52:05,285
Speaker 9:  companies a jumpstart in that way. And so that's kind of what he's trying

796
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:09,205
Speaker 9:  to do here, but at the same time he is kind of limiting that a lot

797
00:52:09,205 --> 00:52:13,125
Speaker 9:  more than what the Justice Department said would be necessary to really

798
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:16,965
Speaker 9:  get them there by saying, you know, we're not gonna

799
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:21,205
Speaker 9:  let you have access to this on a periodic basis. You'll just

800
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:24,845
Speaker 9:  get like one snapshot in time and that should give you a sense of like what

801
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:28,605
Speaker 9:  Google knows or, you know, saying you can only

802
00:52:29,675 --> 00:52:33,165
Speaker 9:  have some access to some of these features for

803
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:37,565
Speaker 9:  six years rather than 10. So I think that's kind

804
00:52:37,565 --> 00:52:41,285
Speaker 9:  of how he's tried to like walk this line and

805
00:52:41,355 --> 00:52:44,925
Speaker 9:  he's really wary of making these rivals

806
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:48,765
Speaker 9:  dependent on Google. He doesn't want them to feel like, okay, we have like

807
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,285
Speaker 9:  a long runway to figure this out and we could just like

808
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:56,245
Speaker 9:  coast on Google's data. In the meantime he wants them to build

809
00:52:56,265 --> 00:52:57,845
Speaker 9:  up to be their own services.

810
00:52:58,515 --> 00:53:02,285
Speaker 5:  Have you heard from, you know, the Mozillas, the DuckDuckGo, like how they

811
00:53:02,285 --> 00:53:05,045
Speaker 5:  feel about this? Like is this going to be helpful to them?

812
00:53:05,525 --> 00:53:09,285
Speaker 9:  I mean, I think Mozilla is relieved that they will not be

813
00:53:09,905 --> 00:53:13,245
Speaker 9:  losing a huge chunk of their revenue that comes from Google

814
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:16,125
Speaker 9:  for default payments for Firefox.

815
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:21,565
Speaker 9:  I think DuckDuckGo was really not happy

816
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:25,645
Speaker 9:  with this ruling and you know, they ultimately

817
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:26,605
Speaker 9:  said

818
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:32,005
Speaker 9:  their CEO Gabriel Weinberg said in a statement quote, Google will

819
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:35,165
Speaker 9:  still be allowed to continue to use its monopoly to hold back competitors

820
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:38,885
Speaker 9:  including an AI search. As a result, consumers will continue to

821
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:42,605
Speaker 9:  suffer. We believe Congress should now step in and

822
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:46,525
Speaker 9:  you know, if you're calling on Congress to step in at this point after

823
00:53:47,215 --> 00:53:51,085
Speaker 9:  we've seen these bills shot down before, you know, that really feels

824
00:53:51,085 --> 00:53:52,365
Speaker 9:  like a a last resort.

825
00:53:53,225 --> 00:53:56,805
Speaker 5:  So I there's the, there's this takeout there And I I'm curious your thought

826
00:53:56,805 --> 00:54:00,245
Speaker 5:  like it seemed people Google, Google clearly lost

827
00:54:00,865 --> 00:54:04,765
Speaker 5:  the, the lawsuit, right? They were ruled to have a

828
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:08,845
Speaker 5:  monopoly that is the last thing they wanted. But when it comes

829
00:54:08,865 --> 00:54:12,845
Speaker 5:  to the remedies, it kind of seems like they won. Do, do you agree

830
00:54:12,845 --> 00:54:13,125
Speaker 5:  with that?

831
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:17,165
Speaker 9:  I do largely agree with that. I mean, basically what the judge

832
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:21,485
Speaker 9:  granted was pretty much most of what, pretty

833
00:54:21,485 --> 00:54:25,325
Speaker 9:  much all of what Google had proposed that they said we'd be fine with

834
00:54:25,325 --> 00:54:28,645
Speaker 9:  this, which is basically the exclusivity contracts aspect.

835
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:34,365
Speaker 9:  And then he imposed somewhat more of what the Justice Department

836
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:38,165
Speaker 9:  asked for in terms of some of the search data and other syndication

837
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:42,005
Speaker 9:  that he ordered. But really the

838
00:54:42,085 --> 00:54:45,165
Speaker 9:  DOJ lost out on all of its other big ass.

839
00:54:46,345 --> 00:54:49,885
Speaker 9:  So, you know, it's not a total loss for the Justice Department, but it's

840
00:54:49,905 --> 00:54:53,685
Speaker 9:  far short of what they asked for and seems to be far short of what

841
00:54:54,035 --> 00:54:57,565
Speaker 9:  many critics here think would be necessary to

842
00:54:57,755 --> 00:54:58,845
Speaker 9:  restore competition.

843
00:54:59,245 --> 00:55:02,045
Speaker 5:  I wanna ask maybe a bigger picture question. You had this story that ran

844
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:06,005
Speaker 5:  on Thursday, you said The tech antitrust renaissance may already be over.

845
00:55:06,785 --> 00:55:10,525
Speaker 5:  Can, can you, can you dive into that more? 'cause the, there was, I think

846
00:55:10,525 --> 00:55:13,965
Speaker 5:  this big burst of momentum and energy

847
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:18,285
Speaker 5:  toward, you know, tearing apart big tech and it seemed like this was

848
00:55:18,285 --> 00:55:21,965
Speaker 5:  gonna be the moment. And I I think you're saying maybe,

849
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:24,645
Speaker 5:  maybe it fizzled out before it, before it even started.

850
00:55:25,395 --> 00:55:29,005
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I mean I, I started on this beat about six years ago when

851
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:33,205
Speaker 9:  a lot of this was starting to bubble up. And at the time, you know, there

852
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:37,085
Speaker 9:  was this kind of feeling around antitrust for a long

853
00:55:37,085 --> 00:55:40,325
Speaker 9:  time that, you know, we should kind of just look at

854
00:55:41,665 --> 00:55:45,245
Speaker 9:  at like prices and do prices go up or down and

855
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:49,285
Speaker 9:  what does that mean for consumers and we should really be restrained and

856
00:55:49,285 --> 00:55:52,925
Speaker 9:  how we think about antitrust. And that was just

857
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:57,005
Speaker 9:  beginning to change with things like Lena Khan coming on the scene with

858
00:55:57,365 --> 00:56:01,205
Speaker 9:  a proposal about how we should look differently at markets

859
00:56:01,395 --> 00:56:05,005
Speaker 9:  that aren't necessarily, don't necessarily have a price tag for

860
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:08,925
Speaker 9:  consumers, like is the case in digital markets a lot of the time, but

861
00:56:09,335 --> 00:56:12,245
Speaker 9:  still have, you know, a lot of power.

862
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:17,005
Speaker 9:  And you know, she kind of came onto the scene making a

863
00:56:17,765 --> 00:56:21,325
Speaker 9:  argument about how to go after Amazon's alleged monopoly.

864
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:26,365
Speaker 9:  And then we saw this explosion of interest from

865
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:30,525
Speaker 9:  lawmakers from outside groups and you know, eventually from the

866
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:34,485
Speaker 9:  enforcers themselves to actually kind of take this new approach

867
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:38,645
Speaker 9:  to antitrust. And you know, in 2019

868
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:42,725
Speaker 9:  we saw the House Judiciary committee start to investigate all

869
00:56:42,725 --> 00:56:46,645
Speaker 9:  of these companies. We saw the DOJ and the FTC begin to look into all of

870
00:56:46,645 --> 00:56:50,605
Speaker 9:  these companies. And all of that has resulted in lawsuits at this

871
00:56:50,605 --> 00:56:54,365
Speaker 9:  point against Google, meta Apple, Amazon. I mean

872
00:56:54,365 --> 00:56:58,045
Speaker 9:  that's just unheard of for at one point in time to have huge

873
00:56:58,605 --> 00:57:02,565
Speaker 9:  monopoly cases against all of these companies. So it was

874
00:57:02,565 --> 00:57:06,445
Speaker 9:  really a milestone. And then, you know, in

875
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:10,125
Speaker 9:  the last couple years we've seen these cases begin to go to trial

876
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:14,085
Speaker 9:  and having the initial liability finding

877
00:57:14,235 --> 00:57:17,965
Speaker 9:  from Judge Mea saying that Google is a monopoly in online

878
00:57:17,965 --> 00:57:21,685
Speaker 9:  search. I mean that was just huge. That was such a

879
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:25,445
Speaker 9:  watershed moment for this movement and seemed to really

880
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:29,365
Speaker 9:  solidify like, okay, really we can get the courts on board

881
00:57:29,365 --> 00:57:32,205
Speaker 9:  here if we put in the work, if we bring these cases.

882
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:37,605
Speaker 9:  And I think getting to this point and seeing, okay, yes,

883
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:42,525
Speaker 9:  we got a court, the Justice Department got a court to find

884
00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:47,165
Speaker 9:  a tech company to be a monopoly, but then he

885
00:57:47,165 --> 00:57:50,925
Speaker 9:  does kind of the bare minimum to

886
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,765
Speaker 9:  remedy it. That is, that's a real setback. And I think it's,

887
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:59,205
Speaker 9:  it just casts some doubt on how far courts will really be willing to

888
00:57:59,205 --> 00:58:02,725
Speaker 9:  go to address this problem.

889
00:58:03,425 --> 00:58:07,325
Speaker 9:  And, you know, it could be that in a few years it turns out that

890
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:11,005
Speaker 9:  this was the outlier. You know, there's Google is gonna face the DOJ later

891
00:58:11,005 --> 00:58:14,805
Speaker 9:  this month in its other case that it lost to the

892
00:58:14,805 --> 00:58:18,685
Speaker 9:  Justice Department over its ad tech monopoly. And

893
00:58:18,755 --> 00:58:22,125
Speaker 9:  it's very possible that the judge in that case could say,

894
00:58:22,545 --> 00:58:26,365
Speaker 9:  I'm gonna break up part of Google's ad tech business. And

895
00:58:26,365 --> 00:58:30,285
Speaker 9:  we could see similar more, you know, aggressive rulings in some

896
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:34,125
Speaker 9:  of these other cases. So it is too soon, soon to know what the

897
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:38,045
Speaker 9:  arc of history on this will look like. But I think it is just

898
00:58:38,205 --> 00:58:41,565
Speaker 9:  a, a kind of a, a warning to

899
00:58:42,505 --> 00:58:46,325
Speaker 9:  the optimism that's existed in this space that, you know, there's still

900
00:58:46,325 --> 00:58:49,805
Speaker 9:  such a long road ahead and the hardest part may be yet to come.

901
00:58:50,345 --> 00:58:54,165
Speaker 6:  I'm just curious because like you're kind of mentioning that this is a marathon,

902
00:58:54,305 --> 00:58:57,765
Speaker 6:  not like a 5K, just use runner analogies,

903
00:58:58,385 --> 00:59:01,925
Speaker 6:  but, you know, I'm just curious how much of the environmental

904
00:59:02,235 --> 00:59:06,125
Speaker 6:  vibe shift plays into this. Because if this started six years ago

905
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,445
Speaker 6:  then, well, a lot of this momentum and energy started under the,

906
00:59:10,025 --> 00:59:14,005
Speaker 6:  the initial Trump regime and then gained some momentum I guess during the

907
00:59:14,005 --> 00:59:17,525
Speaker 6:  Biden years. And you know, I think everyone would agree that there's been

908
00:59:17,605 --> 00:59:21,405
Speaker 6:  a little bit of an energy change since, you know, the

909
00:59:21,405 --> 00:59:25,205
Speaker 6:  start of 2025. So I'm just curious, like, does that also

910
00:59:25,675 --> 00:59:29,565
Speaker 6:  play into this like fear that the Renaissance might be over before

911
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:33,365
Speaker 6:  it began because yeah, ostensibly there's a long time before there's

912
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:36,965
Speaker 6:  another vibe shift maybe, or maybe there'll never be another vibe shift again.

913
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:40,245
Speaker 6:  So just curious how much that plays into like,

914
00:59:40,765 --> 00:59:44,365
Speaker 6:  thoughts regarding like how this is gonna go with all of these big

915
00:59:44,365 --> 00:59:45,125
Speaker 6:  antitrust cases.

916
00:59:45,635 --> 00:59:49,205
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it's a great point. I mean, I think it's impossible to ignore the,

917
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:52,605
Speaker 9:  you know, political influence here and just the way,

918
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:57,445
Speaker 9:  you know, the political moment has shifted at the same

919
00:59:57,445 --> 01:00:00,525
Speaker 9:  time. It's, it's really interesting and I've written about this a good amount.

920
01:00:01,145 --> 01:00:04,885
Speaker 9:  It, it's been such a bipartisan movement here and

921
01:00:04,885 --> 01:00:08,765
Speaker 9:  it's not that it's like all sides of both parties really

922
01:00:08,765 --> 01:00:12,685
Speaker 9:  care about this, but it's, you know, a certain subset of each party is

923
01:00:12,685 --> 01:00:15,685
Speaker 9:  really invested. And you'll see like, you know,

924
01:00:16,765 --> 01:00:19,645
Speaker 9:  I think at one hearing there was like Matt Gaetz and

925
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:24,205
Speaker 9:  you know, we'll be saying something that sounds a lot like Elizabeth Warren

926
01:00:25,145 --> 01:00:29,045
Speaker 9:  and so it's just like really perplexing sometimes. But then I think

927
01:00:29,545 --> 01:00:33,485
Speaker 9:  you end up seeing like in this moment, especially amid

928
01:00:33,485 --> 01:00:37,165
Speaker 9:  like all the upheaval we saw earlier this year with Doge,

929
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:41,725
Speaker 9:  with, you know, mark Zuckerberg coming to the White House

930
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:44,485
Speaker 9:  right before his antitrust case went to trial,

931
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:49,525
Speaker 9:  you know, all of this kind of fear about outside influence, corporate

932
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:53,485
Speaker 9:  influence and just how the Trump administration

933
01:00:53,565 --> 01:00:57,125
Speaker 9:  would conduct itself, his dismantling

934
01:00:57,385 --> 01:01:01,245
Speaker 9:  of different agencies and kind of taking Democrats

935
01:01:01,305 --> 01:01:04,965
Speaker 9:  off the Federal Trade Commission. I think all of that just kind of

936
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:08,885
Speaker 9:  created this questioning and distrust among, between

937
01:01:08,885 --> 01:01:12,365
Speaker 9:  the parties around all of this. So I don't know that it necessarily

938
01:01:13,455 --> 01:01:17,165
Speaker 9:  undermines the like policy goals that I think are

939
01:01:17,275 --> 01:01:20,885
Speaker 9:  kind of deeply held beliefs, at least within

940
01:01:21,165 --> 01:01:24,845
Speaker 9:  a lot of members of this movement on both sides. But I think it's

941
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:28,365
Speaker 9:  impossible to ignore the possible influence of that

942
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:32,285
Speaker 9:  and just kind of the different moment that we're in right now.

943
01:01:32,665 --> 01:01:36,605
Speaker 5:  And I think you're right that at a bare minimum, this is a a a coming back

944
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:39,965
Speaker 5:  down to earth moment. This is a ev even if we get there,

945
01:01:40,505 --> 01:01:44,365
Speaker 5:  judges are, are typically very cautious in

946
01:01:44,365 --> 01:01:48,085
Speaker 5:  how they approach these remedies. And you know, I I think it

947
01:01:48,085 --> 01:01:51,805
Speaker 5:  says a lot that Google at, at least as of the time we're recording this on

948
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:55,965
Speaker 5:  Thursday afternoon, Google has not appealed, right? They, they still

949
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:59,685
Speaker 5:  could, but I I I tend to find that most companies

950
01:02:00,135 --> 01:02:03,805
Speaker 5:  about 30 minutes after an opinion comes down, put out a statement saying

951
01:02:03,805 --> 01:02:05,845
Speaker 5:  this is terrible. This is the worst thing that's ever happened and we are

952
01:02:05,845 --> 01:02:09,725
Speaker 5:  gonna appeal. And, and Google put out a statement that was actually like,

953
01:02:09,985 --> 01:02:13,525
Speaker 5:  you know, the judge, he was very thoughtful in this case. We were just like,

954
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:17,165
Speaker 5:  not not what you expect to happen. They, they didn't have that one drafted.

955
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:21,125
Speaker 5:  They, they had to write that one on the fly. So Lauren, what happens

956
01:02:21,235 --> 01:02:24,045
Speaker 5:  next here, right? Thi this still could get appealed,

957
01:02:25,065 --> 01:02:28,965
Speaker 5:  it could eventually be put into, into place. What are we waiting on?

958
01:02:29,315 --> 01:02:32,845
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I I think it still is pretty likely that Google Appeals, they said

959
01:02:32,845 --> 01:02:36,805
Speaker 9:  before this came out that they would appeal because basically they

960
01:02:36,805 --> 01:02:40,645
Speaker 9:  had to wait for the remedies ruling to come out to even appeal the underlying

961
01:02:40,645 --> 01:02:44,605
Speaker 9:  liability finding. And Google doesn't like being called a monopolist. It,

962
01:02:44,785 --> 01:02:48,605
Speaker 9:  it probably is going to appeal that part of the ruling,

963
01:02:49,025 --> 01:02:52,165
Speaker 9:  but, you know, we'll, we'll see what happens there. The other thing that

964
01:02:52,165 --> 01:02:55,765
Speaker 9:  could happen is that the DOJ or the states

965
01:02:55,915 --> 01:02:59,725
Speaker 9:  that also brought this case against Google

966
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:04,125
Speaker 9:  could appeal to get more of the remedies that they were asking

967
01:03:04,225 --> 01:03:07,845
Speaker 9:  for. So we could see appeals from one or both

968
01:03:07,895 --> 01:03:11,885
Speaker 9:  sides here and then that would go up to the appeals court and that could

969
01:03:11,885 --> 01:03:15,605
Speaker 9:  eventually go up to the Supreme Court. So even though

970
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:19,845
Speaker 9:  a lot of these remedies could go in place soon, you know, they

971
01:03:19,845 --> 01:03:23,805
Speaker 9:  could all be kind of paused while all of this goes on. And it really could

972
01:03:23,805 --> 01:03:26,805
Speaker 9:  be a long time before any of this really comes to fruition.

973
01:03:27,445 --> 01:03:28,125
Speaker 9:  RIP Lauren?

974
01:03:28,825 --> 01:03:29,045
Speaker 5:  Yes.

975
01:03:30,665 --> 01:03:31,685
Speaker 9:  You know where to find me.

976
01:03:33,555 --> 01:03:37,445
Speaker 5:  Stay tuned. Maybe we will have a GI by the time the

977
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:41,165
Speaker 5:  the actual remedies come down. All right, we've gotta take a break when we

978
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:45,045
Speaker 5:  get back. The Thunder Round is back and better than ever, stay tuned.

979
01:06:37,145 --> 01:06:41,105
Speaker 5:  I have to warn you all may come to an end as soon as next

980
01:06:41,105 --> 01:06:44,945
Speaker 5:  week I'm gonna have to fight David Pierce. Two

981
01:06:44,955 --> 01:06:48,745
Speaker 5:  podcasters enter, only one will leave to find out whether

982
01:06:48,765 --> 01:06:52,665
Speaker 5:  the thunder round continues. Listen, if you love the thunder round, if you

983
01:06:52,665 --> 01:06:56,545
Speaker 5:  support the thunder round, I'm gonna need you to email vergecast at The

984
01:06:56,665 --> 01:07:00,385
Speaker 5:  Verge dot com. Tell us how important it's to you.

985
01:07:00,695 --> 01:07:04,585
Speaker 5:  This is the thunder round. Five stories, five minutes each. When we're running

986
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:08,345
Speaker 5:  outta time, we'll hear some rumbling thunder. When time is

987
01:07:08,565 --> 01:07:12,385
Speaker 5:  up, our producer Travis Sluck will strike us down with

988
01:07:12,545 --> 01:07:16,465
Speaker 5:  a final crash. That means it's time to move on. Alright V

989
01:07:16,645 --> 01:07:18,145
Speaker 5:  you're up first. What have we got?

990
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:21,625
Speaker 6:  Okay, so my question is, would you pay

991
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:26,065
Speaker 6:  $2,000 for a smartwatch? Because that's what

992
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:30,105
Speaker 6:  Garmin is asking from some people. They came out with an announcement

993
01:07:30,105 --> 01:07:33,945
Speaker 6:  this week about the, their flagship Garmin Fenix eight Pro

994
01:07:34,205 --> 01:07:38,025
Speaker 6:  series. So it's like an S year for Garmin. The Fenix is their flagship

995
01:07:38,025 --> 01:07:41,145
Speaker 6:  line and just like how the iPhone used to have an iPhone four, then iPhone

996
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:44,905
Speaker 6:  four s the S year is just like, ah, that many updates. So they just

997
01:07:44,905 --> 01:07:48,785
Speaker 6:  came out with the S year Pro Garmin

998
01:07:48,785 --> 01:07:52,665
Speaker 6:  Fenix eight and you know, there's some really cool things

999
01:07:52,665 --> 01:07:56,505
Speaker 6:  they finally added LTE and satellite SOS kind of

1000
01:07:56,615 --> 01:07:59,545
Speaker 6:  kind of, you have to use the Garmin Messenger app. So it's not like you can

1001
01:07:59,545 --> 01:08:02,625
Speaker 6:  have an actual phone number on on your Garmin or

1002
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:08,185
Speaker 6:  a fully like how you would think of a data connection on that.

1003
01:08:08,415 --> 01:08:11,865
Speaker 5:  Doesn't the Apple Watch Ultra have that for half the price?

1004
01:08:12,495 --> 01:08:16,445
Speaker 6:  It's for $10 and it's 800. You know the, the LTE connection

1005
01:08:16,445 --> 01:08:20,205
Speaker 6:  is generally $10 depending on your carrier and the Apple Watch

1006
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:23,965
Speaker 6:  Ultra is $800. But, but they're saying,

1007
01:08:24,395 --> 01:08:28,045
Speaker 6:  hold on now the starting price for an OLED display

1008
01:08:28,515 --> 01:08:32,325
Speaker 6:  will be $1,200. If you go a

1009
01:08:32,325 --> 01:08:35,605
Speaker 6:  slight size up, it'll be $1,300. But if you want the micro

1010
01:08:36,085 --> 01:08:39,365
Speaker 6:  LED display, which has a maximum brightness of

1011
01:08:39,795 --> 01:08:43,165
Speaker 6:  4,500 knits, which I don't think I've ever heard

1012
01:08:43,865 --> 01:08:47,565
Speaker 6:  of any device with a maximum brightness of 4,500

1013
01:08:47,845 --> 01:08:50,685
Speaker 6:  knits, you have the privilege and the distinct honor of paying

1014
01:08:51,105 --> 01:08:54,965
Speaker 6:  $2,000. And I was just like, you can't convince people

1015
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:58,005
Speaker 6:  to spend $2,000 for a foldable phone that does a lot of stuff.

1016
01:08:58,785 --> 01:09:02,605
Speaker 6:  2000 do 2000 do $2,000. Like

1017
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:05,205
Speaker 6:  people were losing their minds over the garments. 'cause Fenix eight being

1018
01:09:05,205 --> 01:09:08,485
Speaker 6:  a thousand dollars, $2,000, $2,000

1019
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:13,005
Speaker 5:  For $2,000. This thing better like be 4K. Like I, I better be able to

1020
01:09:13,005 --> 01:09:15,765
Speaker 5:  watch like Dolby Vision movies on my wrist

1021
01:09:16,755 --> 01:09:19,885
Speaker 5:  like with, with this thing. So I don't what is the

1022
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:24,125
Speaker 5:  outdoorsy use case where you absolutely need 4,500 and

1023
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:27,925
Speaker 5:  it's like, it's like you exclusively hike in the desert with

1024
01:09:27,985 --> 01:09:31,605
Speaker 5:  the midday sun directly overhead and you just like can't

1025
01:09:31,925 --> 01:09:34,885
Speaker 5:  possibly rotate your wrist enough to like see it. Y

1026
01:09:34,915 --> 01:09:38,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, it's, it's mostly so you can see things in bright direct

1027
01:09:38,765 --> 01:09:42,245
Speaker 6:  sunlight, but it's really funny 'cause I was reading the comments and everyone

1028
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:45,765
Speaker 6:  was just like, what No memory and Pixel trans reflective

1029
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:49,725
Speaker 6:  display, which you know, will let the battery be 4,000 years

1030
01:09:49,795 --> 01:09:50,085
Speaker 6:  long.

1031
01:09:52,385 --> 01:09:54,045
Speaker 5:  Now the display that bright not

1032
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:57,965
Speaker 6:  Happening. No, no. So the micro lead will be I think about

1033
01:09:58,145 --> 01:10:01,925
Speaker 6:  10 day battery life. And for Gar that's pretty good. If you're talking about

1034
01:10:01,985 --> 01:10:05,845
Speaker 6:  for, for an Apple Watch or the Pixel Watch or a Samsung watch 10

1035
01:10:06,005 --> 01:10:09,885
Speaker 6:  days battery life, holy sign me up Bob. But for a

1036
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:13,885
Speaker 6:  Garmin where they measure the battery life in weeks

1037
01:10:14,025 --> 01:10:17,205
Speaker 6:  and months, 10 days, they're like 10 days.

1038
01:10:17,865 --> 01:10:18,085
Speaker 6:  Is

1039
01:10:18,085 --> 01:10:21,725
Speaker 9:  This supposed to be like a part of the ultralight hiking movement so that

1040
01:10:21,725 --> 01:10:25,685
Speaker 9:  like you don't have to bring your phone or your satellite phone, but

1041
01:10:25,845 --> 01:10:29,645
Speaker 9:  I don't get how you would be able to rely on this to send all your messages

1042
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:31,205
Speaker 9:  if you are an emergency?

1043
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:36,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah, kind of like basically what they're doing. 'cause it's really hard

1044
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:40,485
Speaker 6:  to negotiate these carrier deals for the smaller, I say smaller brands like

1045
01:10:40,565 --> 01:10:44,245
Speaker 6:  Garmin's, a publicly traded company, but it's just, it's not

1046
01:10:44,345 --> 01:10:48,245
Speaker 6:  on the scale of like Apple or Google, right? So it's harder for them to

1047
01:10:48,355 --> 01:10:52,325
Speaker 6:  negotiate the, the carrier deals. So what they're doing is they're relying

1048
01:10:52,325 --> 01:10:55,885
Speaker 6:  on the Garmin in reach satellite communications to bring

1049
01:10:56,045 --> 01:10:59,685
Speaker 6:  LTEM to these watches and satellite

1050
01:10:59,685 --> 01:11:03,485
Speaker 6:  connectivity. So depending where you are, if you make an SOS

1051
01:11:03,485 --> 01:11:06,845
Speaker 6:  call, which is the big appeal of these things, it'll

1052
01:11:07,285 --> 01:11:11,045
Speaker 6:  reroute you to the Garmin like response center. So Garmin is gonna be like

1053
01:11:11,045 --> 01:11:14,925
Speaker 6:  a middleman in every step of the thing. Your watch won't have its

1054
01:11:14,925 --> 01:11:18,765
Speaker 6:  own cell phone number. You can only call other Garmin Fenix

1055
01:11:18,765 --> 01:11:22,085
Speaker 6:  eight. So your friend who has also spent over a thousand dollars for Garmin

1056
01:11:22,085 --> 01:11:25,685
Speaker 6:  Fenix eight and or the family members that you've badgered

1057
01:11:25,795 --> 01:11:29,725
Speaker 6:  into downloading the Garmin Messenger app, which is their proprietary app

1058
01:11:29,725 --> 01:11:33,525
Speaker 6:  to enable text messaging more thoroughly on

1059
01:11:33,525 --> 01:11:37,445
Speaker 6:  their, on their device. And you know, they introduced that last year

1060
01:11:37,645 --> 01:11:41,165
Speaker 6:  I tested it for the Garmin Fenix eight review. I had a friend download it

1061
01:11:41,165 --> 01:11:44,445
Speaker 6:  and as soon as I was done with the review, she was like, so the review stuff.

1062
01:11:44,445 --> 01:11:47,845
Speaker 6:  And I was like, yeah, she's like, can I delete this app now? So

1063
01:11:48,745 --> 01:11:52,685
Speaker 6:  it it's great helps them compete more with Apple

1064
01:11:52,825 --> 01:11:56,725
Speaker 6:  and all those stuff. But I can't help but feel like they've lost the

1065
01:11:56,725 --> 01:12:00,605
Speaker 6:  plot a little bit for what their users actually want. So $2,000,

1066
01:12:00,705 --> 01:12:01,485
Speaker 6:  that's that's my,

1067
01:12:01,555 --> 01:12:05,525
Speaker 5:  They have taken the best and worst parts of micro ld, which is really

1068
01:12:05,525 --> 01:12:08,765
Speaker 5:  bright and insanely expensive. Yeah.

1069
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,565
Speaker 5:  Alright. Lauren, what have you got?

1070
01:12:12,515 --> 01:12:15,805
Speaker 9:  Okay, so I'm here to deliver some devastating news

1071
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:20,805
Speaker 9:  that Amazon is cracking down on how you share your

1072
01:12:20,805 --> 01:12:23,725
Speaker 9:  prime shipping benefits with your friends and family.

1073
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:28,565
Speaker 9:  Yeah, this was, this was huge news in my family because on the

1074
01:12:28,565 --> 01:12:32,405
Speaker 9:  day that the Google search remedies ruling came out, my dad

1075
01:12:32,405 --> 01:12:36,125
Speaker 9:  said, okay, yeah, but have you seen that you have to stop mooching off of

1076
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:39,685
Speaker 9:  our Amazon benefits? So yeah,

1077
01:12:39,685 --> 01:12:43,045
Speaker 9:  basically they're making it so, you know, they, they're kind of changing

1078
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:46,965
Speaker 9:  this invitee program that they had into Amazon

1079
01:12:46,965 --> 01:12:50,925
Speaker 9:  family. And under that program you kind of, everyone who's part of that

1080
01:12:50,985 --> 01:12:54,565
Speaker 9:  has to be part of the same primary household. So

1081
01:12:54,785 --> 01:12:58,605
Speaker 9:  if you don't live with the other person in your family or your

1082
01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:02,365
Speaker 9:  friend group that you share a prime account with, you can't kind of share

1083
01:13:02,595 --> 01:13:06,285
Speaker 9:  that, those prime benefits. It seems like,

1084
01:13:06,395 --> 01:13:10,045
Speaker 9:  from how I'm reading it, that you could still just

1085
01:13:10,115 --> 01:13:13,965
Speaker 9:  have, you know, your friend or family member ship you stuff from

1086
01:13:13,965 --> 01:13:17,285
Speaker 9:  their account, just do like a different address or you could log in there,

1087
01:13:17,345 --> 01:13:21,045
Speaker 9:  but you can't have like your own account and use their shipping benefits.

1088
01:13:21,505 --> 01:13:25,325
Speaker 5:  I'm not letting somebody else see my Amazon purchase history. Like

1089
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:29,285
Speaker 5:  I just cannot explain like why I bought like a tarp and like

1090
01:13:29,445 --> 01:13:33,005
Speaker 5:  a tomato plant stick and also like 15

1091
01:13:33,165 --> 01:13:36,885
Speaker 5:  USBC cables in the same order. Like, it just, it just doesn't add up.

1092
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:40,765
Speaker 5:  I, I had no idea that this was even a benefit that that was allowed,

1093
01:13:41,235 --> 01:13:44,845
Speaker 5:  like Netflix password sharing, like, okay, that makes sense.

1094
01:13:44,955 --> 01:13:48,445
Speaker 5:  Like these are just computers. Netflix isn't tied to my house.

1095
01:13:49,185 --> 01:13:52,765
Speaker 5:  Amazon, pa Amazon is like very singular to me. So I was like, honestly,

1096
01:13:52,975 --> 01:13:56,085
Speaker 5:  maybe I'm just outta the loop, maybe I'm just left behind. I didn't realize

1097
01:13:56,105 --> 01:13:59,365
Speaker 5:  you are, I I barely even realized you could share it within your household.

1098
01:13:59,425 --> 01:14:01,085
Speaker 5:  So I was like, hmm, that

1099
01:14:01,265 --> 01:14:01,685
Speaker 6:  No. Oh,

1100
01:14:01,885 --> 01:14:04,205
Speaker 5:  I thought I was getting an upgrade. Jake, it's not true

1101
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:08,725
Speaker 6:  Jake, you gotta get on the password sharing at least within your house because

1102
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:12,405
Speaker 6:  oh, you're that, you know, for a while before like

1103
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:16,565
Speaker 6:  tied the knot said holy matrimony, we were paying

1104
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:20,565
Speaker 6:  for our individual prime stuff. And then when

1105
01:14:21,065 --> 01:14:24,485
Speaker 6:  we found out that we were basically paying twice while living under the same

1106
01:14:24,485 --> 01:14:26,925
Speaker 6:  household, we were like, why are we doing this? Why should we have to be

1107
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:30,685
Speaker 6:  doing this? But I hate that Amazon is basically taking a

1108
01:14:30,685 --> 01:14:34,485
Speaker 6:  page out of the streamers book. I mean, come on man,

1109
01:14:34,545 --> 01:14:38,005
Speaker 6:  we all got subscription fatigue. Let us have this,

1110
01:14:38,545 --> 01:14:40,965
Speaker 6:  let us have our shipping come on.

1111
01:14:41,355 --> 01:14:44,285
Speaker 5:  Like the narrative though for subscriptions over the past, what, like two

1112
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:47,325
Speaker 5:  years at this point? And it, like, it was started by Netflix and they were

1113
01:14:47,325 --> 01:14:50,525
Speaker 5:  like, we're gonna crack down passwords and like they, they expanded it globally

1114
01:14:51,025 --> 01:14:54,565
Speaker 5:  and now it's kind of everyone, like if they haven't done it already,

1115
01:14:54,795 --> 01:14:57,085
Speaker 5:  they have announced that they're going to do it. I'm pretty sure it came

1116
01:14:57,085 --> 01:14:59,965
Speaker 5:  to HBO, I'm pretty sure it, it came or is coming to Disney Plus

1117
01:15:01,345 --> 01:15:05,205
Speaker 5:  and, and Amazon Prime. I I'm gonna say this

1118
01:15:05,205 --> 01:15:08,925
Speaker 5:  one actually makes the most sense to me as a thing that

1119
01:15:09,335 --> 01:15:13,165
Speaker 5:  feels very focused on a single location. But

1120
01:15:13,165 --> 01:15:16,725
Speaker 5:  nonetheless, like these things are expensive and

1121
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:20,845
Speaker 5:  every time another company does a crackdown, it adds another subscription

1122
01:15:20,845 --> 01:15:23,965
Speaker 5:  to everybody else. And so it's like each crackdown is hurting

1123
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:28,125
Speaker 5:  the next company that does a crackdown because they're just going to have

1124
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:31,605
Speaker 5:  fewer people who are willing to add a subscription. Like I am, I am

1125
01:15:31,905 --> 01:15:35,885
Speaker 5:  tapped out, I have too many things I like when it

1126
01:15:35,885 --> 01:15:39,845
Speaker 5:  comes to streaming services. I just like save it up until there's like enough

1127
01:15:39,845 --> 01:15:42,725
Speaker 5:  like movies and shows that I wanna watch and then like try to knock it out

1128
01:15:42,725 --> 01:15:45,885
Speaker 5:  and like a month or two because I'm like, I can't keep all these going at

1129
01:15:45,885 --> 01:15:48,005
Speaker 5:  the same time. This is outrageous.

1130
01:15:49,085 --> 01:15:52,605
Speaker 9:  I think it's kinda surprising that they let us like have all these

1131
01:15:53,325 --> 01:15:57,125
Speaker 9:  password sharing for as long as they did. And I think once like Netflix

1132
01:15:57,195 --> 01:16:00,685
Speaker 9:  decided we're gonna crack down on this and you know, people didn't just leave

1133
01:16:00,745 --> 01:16:04,325
Speaker 9:  in droves. I think everyone else was like, all right, I guess we could do

1134
01:16:04,325 --> 01:16:04,885
Speaker 9:  it too. Finally.

1135
01:16:05,265 --> 01:16:08,845
Speaker 5:  No, that's so true. Like Netflix was willing to take the reputational hit

1136
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:12,965
Speaker 5:  And I guess people actually just like Netflix enough that they're

1137
01:16:12,965 --> 01:16:15,445
Speaker 5:  like, well what are you gonna do? I'll pay for some more Netflix.

1138
01:16:16,045 --> 01:16:19,525
Speaker 6:  I mean it helps that there's like bundles now, or if you go to a carrier,

1139
01:16:19,595 --> 01:16:22,885
Speaker 6:  they'll be like, we'll give you a free year of this and a free year of that

1140
01:16:23,025 --> 01:16:26,925
Speaker 6:  and you can now within a one bundle get five different subscription

1141
01:16:27,205 --> 01:16:30,805
Speaker 6:  services and you'll save money than if you were subscribing to them all

1142
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:33,925
Speaker 6:  independently. And here's a credit card thing. But I was like, why do we

1143
01:16:33,925 --> 01:16:37,005
Speaker 6:  have to do this? Why do we have to jump through all of these hoops? I had

1144
01:16:37,005 --> 01:16:40,645
Speaker 6:  a racket going with a bunch of six friends where

1145
01:16:40,785 --> 01:16:44,685
Speaker 6:  one person would pay for one service and then put us all as family

1146
01:16:45,065 --> 01:16:48,445
Speaker 6:  and everyone was responsible for paying one subscription

1147
01:16:48,865 --> 01:16:52,725
Speaker 6:  and we were all just on a big old racket and, and this is

1148
01:16:52,725 --> 01:16:56,245
Speaker 6:  like falling apart, but, and so now I'm just like, do I need this service?

1149
01:16:56,565 --> 01:16:59,125
Speaker 6:  I don't, I miss my, my subscription racket.

1150
01:16:59,765 --> 01:17:03,045
Speaker 5:  I will say some of the companies that have done these crackdowns mm

1151
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:07,405
Speaker 5:  they're not as good as cracking down as they say they are. There's, you

1152
01:17:07,405 --> 01:17:10,725
Speaker 5:  know, listen, I, I'm not breaking any rules, but there might be some people

1153
01:17:10,725 --> 01:17:14,605
Speaker 5:  on my, my accounts who are, and they have nobody's caught on yet.

1154
01:17:14,715 --> 01:17:18,645
Speaker 5:  Alright, next story. Okay, so I

1155
01:17:18,645 --> 01:17:21,725
Speaker 5:  have been talking about this, I think the past three weeks. I am

1156
01:17:22,365 --> 01:17:25,365
Speaker 5:  obsessed with the Pixel 10 Pros

1157
01:17:26,145 --> 01:17:29,805
Speaker 5:  100 X zoom feature. So it has this feature called

1158
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:33,805
Speaker 5:  ProRes Zoom, where when you zoom into a hundred x it will use

1159
01:17:34,065 --> 01:17:37,525
Speaker 5:  AI to enhance the image. And I think when we first saw this, I was like,

1160
01:17:38,415 --> 01:17:42,365
Speaker 5:  these demo images that I'm seeing seem like incredible. They,

1161
01:17:42,365 --> 01:17:44,405
Speaker 5:  they're, they're, they're remarkable. I can't believe they look this good.

1162
01:17:44,585 --> 01:17:48,525
Speaker 5:  And then last week I was like, well I'm, I'm maybe seeing a few flaws

1163
01:17:48,525 --> 01:17:52,485
Speaker 5:  here this week. I think I'm ready to say I might

1164
01:17:52,485 --> 01:17:56,205
Speaker 5:  hate it, I might hate it. So Allison Johnson

1165
01:17:56,995 --> 01:18:00,925
Speaker 5:  went out with the Pixel 10 Pro and a cool

1166
01:18:01,065 --> 01:18:04,565
Speaker 5:  pix camera that actually has a 100 X lens. And

1167
01:18:04,765 --> 01:18:08,325
Speaker 5:  number one, you have to see what this camera looks like. It is this

1168
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:12,565
Speaker 5:  enormous black thing. It is like the size of a limb. It,

1169
01:18:12,635 --> 01:18:16,045
Speaker 5:  it's huge because it turns out you need a huge lens to actually get a hundred

1170
01:18:16,205 --> 01:18:20,085
Speaker 5:  x. But she did a bunch of side by side photos with the Pixel 10

1171
01:18:20,085 --> 01:18:23,965
Speaker 5:  Pro and this actual a hundred x zoom. Okay, so I wanna show

1172
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:27,725
Speaker 5:  you two of the photos that Allison took

1173
01:18:27,865 --> 01:18:31,805
Speaker 5:  And I want to hear what, which one you think is better. And this is,

1174
01:18:31,825 --> 01:18:35,285
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna give you the one that I think is maybe the best

1175
01:18:35,325 --> 01:18:38,765
Speaker 5:  presentation from the ai. So here are two photos

1176
01:18:39,545 --> 01:18:43,325
Speaker 5:  of the tales of some planes. So here's photo one

1177
01:18:43,825 --> 01:18:47,685
Speaker 5:  and it is kind of like blurry and ripy and it

1178
01:18:47,685 --> 01:18:51,565
Speaker 5:  almost feels like you can feel the like fumes or something coming out of

1179
01:18:51,585 --> 01:18:54,845
Speaker 5:  the back of the jet engines. And here's another one. And I think this one

1180
01:18:54,845 --> 01:18:58,045
Speaker 5:  is like crisp and clear, maybe a little smooth. The colors are vibrant.

1181
01:18:58,765 --> 01:19:02,685
Speaker 5:  I, I'm curious, do you two have thoughts

1182
01:19:02,685 --> 01:19:04,885
Speaker 5:  on which of these two is a better photo?

1183
01:19:05,425 --> 01:19:09,045
Speaker 6:  The one that doesn't look like amateur impressionist art?

1184
01:19:09,705 --> 01:19:13,005
Speaker 5:  So you're saying, so this one that's currently up between the smooth one

1185
01:19:13,005 --> 01:19:16,485
Speaker 5:  with the, the the bold colors. Lauren, do you, do you feel the same? Do you

1186
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:17,965
Speaker 5:  prefer this one?

1187
01:19:18,965 --> 01:19:22,885
Speaker 9:  I I think the crisper one is better, but it's a little

1188
01:19:22,905 --> 01:19:25,045
Speaker 9:  bit like too, too perfect.

1189
01:19:26,025 --> 01:19:29,685
Speaker 5:  So this is, this is the AI one, and this is I think the best case for it,

1190
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:33,965
Speaker 5:  right? It, it is these sort of big, simple objects,

1191
01:19:34,825 --> 01:19:38,485
Speaker 5:  big bold colors and it's able to clear them up really

1192
01:19:38,585 --> 01:19:42,165
Speaker 5:  neatly and there aren't too many weird artifacts or

1193
01:19:43,215 --> 01:19:47,125
Speaker 5:  messy imperfections or fake things. But I went through all of Allison and

1194
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:50,605
Speaker 5:  this is like the single one that I think actually shows off this feature

1195
01:19:50,605 --> 01:19:54,445
Speaker 5:  being good. But the one that really broke it for me, there's this photo of

1196
01:19:54,465 --> 01:19:58,445
Speaker 5:  the moon that Allison took with the, the Pixel. And I

1197
01:19:58,445 --> 01:20:02,045
Speaker 5:  looked at it And I thought, you know, that's a pretty darn good picture of

1198
01:20:02,045 --> 01:20:05,725
Speaker 5:  the moon. And it like, it looks sharp, it has this incredible texture

1199
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:09,245
Speaker 5:  on it. And I'm like, it has moon texture, it looks like the moon. This is

1200
01:20:09,245 --> 01:20:13,105
Speaker 5:  so cool. And the, the, the moment that I

1201
01:20:13,105 --> 01:20:16,865
Speaker 5:  turned against this feature was when I looked at the actual photo of the

1202
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:19,505
Speaker 5:  moon and it's completely

1203
01:20:19,505 --> 01:20:23,345
Speaker 13:  Different. All the textures made up. It got, it's, it's not there at

1204
01:20:23,345 --> 01:20:25,865
Speaker 13:  all. It was just like, oh yeah, it's

1205
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:29,705
Speaker 5:  Some texture here. So I I I don't know, I oh man,

1206
01:20:29,865 --> 01:20:32,265
Speaker 5:  I I was in pretty messy feelings about this 'cause like, it's

1207
01:20:32,265 --> 01:20:32,825
Speaker 6:  A different color,

1208
01:20:33,355 --> 01:20:35,265
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah, it's certainly a different color.

1209
01:20:37,305 --> 01:20:40,825
Speaker 5:  I don't know. I feel very, very torn because again, I do think like this

1210
01:20:40,825 --> 01:20:44,545
Speaker 5:  one photo of the plane's like, yeah, that's, that's pretty good for,

1211
01:20:44,645 --> 01:20:48,625
Speaker 5:  for a hundred x like that cleans it up nicely. But this moon photo, I'm

1212
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:52,585
Speaker 5:  like, it just made up a bunch of stuff about the moon. Like that's not,

1213
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:56,625
Speaker 5:  that's not what I want from a camera. And Allison just

1214
01:20:56,625 --> 01:21:00,585
Speaker 5:  talked to Mark LaVoy, who he used to

1215
01:21:00,585 --> 01:21:04,345
Speaker 5:  work on the Pixel cameras and now works on cameras at Adobe

1216
01:21:05,405 --> 01:21:09,345
Speaker 5:  and talk to him about putting generative AI in camera apps. And

1217
01:21:09,905 --> 01:21:12,225
Speaker 5:  I don't know, my, the impression I got was that he was kind of

1218
01:21:13,815 --> 01:21:17,185
Speaker 5:  uncertain if it was a good idea And I I, yeah,

1219
01:21:17,975 --> 01:21:20,705
Speaker 5:  this, this is, this is how I feel. I'm curious, you guys, I I think look

1220
01:21:20,705 --> 01:21:24,265
Speaker 5:  through some of the other photos, like do you have thoughts here? Like

1221
01:21:24,565 --> 01:21:26,145
Speaker 5:  is this good? Is this evil?

1222
01:21:26,735 --> 01:21:27,385
Speaker 6:  It's just why

1223
01:21:27,865 --> 01:21:31,625
Speaker 9:  I feel like I have mixed feelings. Yeah, I, I think it kind of just depends

1224
01:21:31,655 --> 01:21:35,185
Speaker 9:  what you're going for with the photo. Like if you're trying to like capture

1225
01:21:35,605 --> 01:21:39,105
Speaker 9:  the moment that you're in or like, or get like real

1226
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:43,065
Speaker 9:  information from a photo that you're gonna remember, like, I

1227
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,465
Speaker 9:  don't know that I'd wanna rely on AI for that because

1228
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:50,865
Speaker 9:  it's like you could just like download a photo of a really good photo

1229
01:21:50,925 --> 01:21:54,905
Speaker 9:  of the moon if you wanna know what the moon really looks like or, you

1230
01:21:54,905 --> 01:21:57,985
Speaker 9:  know, I feel like some of just like taking photos with your phone is just

1231
01:21:58,185 --> 01:22:01,945
Speaker 9:  like capturing the moment. But yeah, this feels like

1232
01:22:01,945 --> 01:22:02,385
Speaker 9:  something else.

1233
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:06,825
Speaker 6:  Why are you zooming in a hundred times? Just because you can, like what,

1234
01:22:06,825 --> 01:22:10,625
Speaker 6:  what for what reason are we going a hundred times Zoom sometimes

1235
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:11,305
Speaker 6:  is like,

1236
01:22:11,645 --> 01:22:15,265
Speaker 5:  It is because I can, to be clear, right? Like I'm excited by that.

1237
01:22:16,605 --> 01:22:20,585
Speaker 5:  It just, it just doesn't make any sense. Okay, we could do another like 20

1238
01:22:20,755 --> 01:22:24,665
Speaker 5:  hours on, on a hundred x zoom, but we must move on

1239
01:22:25,285 --> 01:22:26,835
Speaker 5:  the what have you got

1240
01:22:28,015 --> 01:22:31,595
Speaker 6:  In the year of our lawyer 2025. You can finally have

1241
01:22:31,595 --> 01:22:34,835
Speaker 6:  Instagram on the iPad. I saw this headline.

1242
01:22:35,105 --> 01:22:38,835
Speaker 5:  They did it. They did, they did it did they did it. This is

1243
01:22:39,015 --> 01:22:42,875
Speaker 5:  the most impressive piece of, oh my gosh,

1244
01:22:43,485 --> 01:22:46,075
Speaker 5:  incredible. Ah, ah,

1245
01:22:47,665 --> 01:22:51,355
Speaker 5:  this is the single most impressive piece of engineering that we've seen out

1246
01:22:51,355 --> 01:22:55,155
Speaker 5:  of meta in years. Can you believe they managed to do this?

1247
01:22:55,505 --> 01:22:58,955
Speaker 6:  It's groundbreaking. I we've only been asking for this

1248
01:22:59,525 --> 01:23:03,275
Speaker 6:  since the inception of Instagram over 10 years ago

1249
01:23:03,815 --> 01:23:05,925
Speaker 6:  and it's just like, oh cool. Instagram

1250
01:23:06,425 --> 01:23:09,845
Speaker 5:  And the iPad are the same age. They're the same age.

1251
01:23:10,325 --> 01:23:11,805
Speaker 5:  They could have done it at any point.

1252
01:23:12,505 --> 01:23:16,285
Speaker 6:  At any point we could have had a native iPad app

1253
01:23:16,355 --> 01:23:20,285
Speaker 6:  that just, you know, blow instead of an iPhone app that just blows up. But

1254
01:23:20,285 --> 01:23:23,965
Speaker 6:  then at the same time, so I was reading me a story on it and it's like, it'll

1255
01:23:24,205 --> 01:23:27,725
Speaker 6:  prominently feature reels And I was like, that's not what I want. That's

1256
01:23:27,725 --> 01:23:31,485
Speaker 6:  not what I want from the iPad Instagram app.

1257
01:23:32,025 --> 01:23:33,485
Speaker 6:  But as there it is,

1258
01:23:33,485 --> 01:23:36,845
Speaker 5:  This is mind blowing. You open it up and it defaults to reels

1259
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:40,525
Speaker 5:  and if you want to find photos on

1260
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:44,845
Speaker 5:  Instagram, you have to go to a new tab that like,

1261
01:23:44,905 --> 01:23:48,125
Speaker 5:  it looks like you're going to find your friends or something. Like it's,

1262
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:52,005
Speaker 5:  it's not a clear photos you need to find, it's buried in a new tab. The

1263
01:23:52,005 --> 01:23:55,605
Speaker 5:  photos, the Instagram part of Instagram is now hidden within

1264
01:23:55,605 --> 01:23:56,205
Speaker 5:  Instagram.

1265
01:23:56,955 --> 01:24:00,565
Speaker 9:  This just screams to me that they just wanted to find another

1266
01:24:00,825 --> 01:24:04,485
Speaker 9:  way to distribute reels and they didn't really have interest in an actual

1267
01:24:04,485 --> 01:24:06,005
Speaker 9:  Instagram app for iPad.

1268
01:24:06,985 --> 01:24:10,925
Speaker 6:  That's exactly it. And it's just like, listen, I'm

1269
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:14,085
Speaker 6:  pitching a news segment called Give the People what they fricking want

1270
01:24:15,225 --> 01:24:18,725
Speaker 6:  and don't edit. Like, you know, there's just so many things where

1271
01:24:19,045 --> 01:24:22,645
Speaker 6:  it's just give the people what they want. We are asking nicely,

1272
01:24:23,385 --> 01:24:27,285
Speaker 6:  please don't put your nefarious agenda into the thing that

1273
01:24:27,285 --> 01:24:31,045
Speaker 6:  we're asking for. Give us our chronological fricking feeds back.

1274
01:24:32,645 --> 01:24:34,045
Speaker 6:  I, I I was just like, yeah,

1275
01:24:34,105 --> 01:24:37,605
Speaker 5:  Listen, I will use the Chinese

1276
01:24:37,975 --> 01:24:40,845
Speaker 5:  state sponsored, you know, NSA

1277
01:24:41,585 --> 01:24:42,805
Speaker 5:  deeply concerned

1278
01:24:44,505 --> 01:24:48,485
Speaker 5:  app TikTok for my short form video and Instagram. I would

1279
01:24:48,485 --> 01:24:52,165
Speaker 5:  like to stick to photos. That's, that's how I feel.

1280
01:24:52,405 --> 01:24:56,285
Speaker 5:  I I'm not, I'm not messing with reels, I'm messing with reels until the

1281
01:24:56,485 --> 01:24:59,845
Speaker 5:  day that TikTok gets banned and then I'll open up my iPad

1282
01:25:00,105 --> 01:25:03,925
Speaker 6:  Photos and stories. That's, you know, honestly just

1283
01:25:03,925 --> 01:25:07,245
Speaker 6:  gimme the stories. I wanna snoop on what my friends are doing and go like,

1284
01:25:07,245 --> 01:25:10,725
Speaker 6:  oh, good for her. Or like, Ooh, that's shady. You know, that's what Instagram

1285
01:25:10,745 --> 01:25:14,645
Speaker 6:  on the iPad should be for just as it is on the

1286
01:25:14,645 --> 01:25:18,525
Speaker 6:  phone. I don't want reels there. Leave me alone. So

1287
01:25:18,795 --> 01:25:22,685
Speaker 6:  yeah, I, it it was just like so wonderful and then

1288
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:26,405
Speaker 6:  so cruel, And I say this as someone who hasn't had a fully charged

1289
01:25:26,675 --> 01:25:30,085
Speaker 6:  iPad in months, so I'm just saying,

1290
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:32,685
Speaker 6:  I'm just saying this is, it is, this is

1291
01:25:33,305 --> 01:25:36,685
Speaker 5:  Meta's approach to the iPad has been bewildering And I realize like,

1292
01:25:38,045 --> 01:25:41,525
Speaker 5:  I don't know, I, I realize it takes some engineering resources. I realize

1293
01:25:41,525 --> 01:25:45,405
Speaker 5:  like maybe it's, it's probably never gonna be the most popular platform for

1294
01:25:45,405 --> 01:25:49,285
Speaker 5:  them, but it is so embarrassing and weird

1295
01:25:49,705 --> 01:25:53,685
Speaker 5:  and ridiculous that today, like you, or at least as of yesterday,

1296
01:25:53,685 --> 01:25:57,645
Speaker 5:  you opened up Instagram and it was still that tiny little square that that

1297
01:25:57,645 --> 01:26:00,925
Speaker 5:  you just like a version of what you'd see on the phone. And the same is true

1298
01:26:00,925 --> 01:26:04,765
Speaker 5:  for threads, right? It, I believe it was true for Whatsapp until pretty recently

1299
01:26:04,765 --> 01:26:08,045
Speaker 5:  as well too. So hopefully, hopefully this means Threads is next.

1300
01:26:08,555 --> 01:26:12,525
Speaker 6:  What do they have against the iPad? Like I'm not a big iPad girly,

1301
01:26:12,785 --> 01:26:16,765
Speaker 6:  but like all of our grandparents and all of the children are on iPads.

1302
01:26:16,765 --> 01:26:19,885
Speaker 6:  Those are great segments to target. I don't get it.

1303
01:26:20,525 --> 01:26:24,005
Speaker 5:  I do think they have beef with Apple meta and Apple definitely have beef,

1304
01:26:24,545 --> 01:26:27,605
Speaker 5:  but like taking it out on the iPad is like

1305
01:26:28,295 --> 01:26:31,685
Speaker 5:  Apple does not notice that. They're like, they're not like,

1306
01:26:32,225 --> 01:26:36,045
Speaker 5:  oh no, but, but Whatsapp for iPad doesn't go

1307
01:26:36,045 --> 01:26:39,765
Speaker 5:  full screen. Like that's not, that's not your leverage

1308
01:26:40,225 --> 01:26:42,525
Speaker 5:  to getting a better deal in the app store.

1309
01:26:43,025 --> 01:26:46,725
Speaker 6:  You're just hurting all the old people with bad eyes, which

1310
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:50,725
Speaker 6:  will be me in a few, like, not even a few years, it's me now. Yeah.

1311
01:26:50,845 --> 01:26:52,085
Speaker 6:  An old person with bad eyes.

1312
01:26:52,205 --> 01:26:55,285
Speaker 5:  I saw your glasses earlier. They are, they're you're already there.

1313
01:26:55,985 --> 01:26:59,885
Speaker 6:  I'm already there. My eyes are garbage eyeballs And I was just,

1314
01:26:59,885 --> 01:27:02,885
Speaker 6:  you know, I was like, oh I don't have to do the thingy and maybe I'll use

1315
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:05,805
Speaker 6:  my iPad more 'cause I don't have to have all these iPhone apps that just

1316
01:27:06,075 --> 01:27:09,525
Speaker 6:  blow up. No, I'm, I'm very upset by this.

1317
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:13,685
Speaker 5:  I know it is finally here and I'm still upset about it because they're using

1318
01:27:13,685 --> 01:27:17,485
Speaker 5:  to push reels. RIP tour Instagram,

1319
01:27:17,825 --> 01:27:21,725
Speaker 5:  it was already not Instagram anymore but now it's

1320
01:27:21,725 --> 01:27:25,285
Speaker 5:  clear where there just lies. Alright Lauren, last one. Take us home.

1321
01:27:26,035 --> 01:27:29,965
Speaker 9:  Last one. So yeah, this is just basically shout out to

1322
01:27:29,975 --> 01:27:33,045
Speaker 9:  Democratic FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who

1323
01:27:33,585 --> 01:27:37,485
Speaker 9:  pretty much every day for past several months has said to check a

1324
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:40,285
Speaker 9:  court docket to figure out if she's going back to work.

1325
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:45,165
Speaker 9:  You might recall that Trump tried to fire her

1326
01:27:45,945 --> 01:27:49,685
Speaker 9:  and her colleague at the time Alvar Bedoya from the Federal Trade Commission,

1327
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:53,765
Speaker 9:  which he technically isn't allowed to do based on Supreme

1328
01:27:53,765 --> 01:27:57,325
Speaker 9:  Court precedent that basically they're trying to challenge

1329
01:27:58,875 --> 01:28:02,765
Speaker 9:  this whole case had to play out and you know,

1330
01:28:02,765 --> 01:28:06,565
Speaker 9:  the district court judge said you can go back. So she went back

1331
01:28:07,025 --> 01:28:10,445
Speaker 9:  and then the appeals court said, wait a minute, we're gonna pause all this

1332
01:28:10,445 --> 01:28:14,005
Speaker 9:  while we figure it out. Then she went home and

1333
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:18,125
Speaker 9:  just this week the, the circuit court

1334
01:28:18,275 --> 01:28:21,485
Speaker 9:  said, okay, you know what, she can go back to work. We're still figuring

1335
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:25,605
Speaker 9:  out the case but you know, for now, like she's allowed to go back. So

1336
01:28:25,955 --> 01:28:29,725
Speaker 9:  yeah, I just can't imagine your life being

1337
01:28:29,865 --> 01:28:32,965
Speaker 9:  run by a court docket in this way, But that

1338
01:28:33,185 --> 01:28:35,525
Speaker 5:  And very publicly, But that's been the situation. Yeah, she's like finding

1339
01:28:35,545 --> 01:28:37,925
Speaker 5:  out in the New York Times if she goes to work in the morning

1340
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:39,045
Speaker 9:  Pretty

1341
01:28:39,045 --> 01:28:41,525
Speaker 5:  Much it's, it's like the weirdest snow day imaginable.

1342
01:28:41,995 --> 01:28:42,725
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that's

1343
01:28:43,665 --> 01:28:47,645
Speaker 6:  That's hell, that's real hell I don't think I could do it. She's a

1344
01:28:47,645 --> 01:28:48,125
Speaker 6:  strong woman.

1345
01:28:48,785 --> 01:28:52,685
Speaker 5:  So ha has, obviously it is, I'm gonna say bad for

1346
01:28:52,745 --> 01:28:56,525
Speaker 5:  the FTC not to have a full set of commissioners and very

1347
01:28:56,525 --> 01:28:59,765
Speaker 5:  problematic for Trump to fire the Democrats. These are

1348
01:28:59,765 --> 01:29:03,525
Speaker 5:  intentionally designed to be be a bar bipartisan commission. Has it allowed

1349
01:29:03,525 --> 01:29:06,485
Speaker 5:  them to, you know, go running

1350
01:29:08,025 --> 01:29:11,085
Speaker 5:  now that there hasn't been two democrats in there? Or

1351
01:29:11,825 --> 01:29:15,605
Speaker 5:  is the FT does that do the FTC commissioners who are left like not even care?

1352
01:29:15,955 --> 01:29:16,365
Speaker 5:  Well I

1353
01:29:16,365 --> 01:29:20,085
Speaker 9:  Think the thing it changes is not so much like what

1354
01:29:20,145 --> 01:29:23,965
Speaker 9:  the, what the commission is actually doing, but just like what sort of insight

1355
01:29:23,985 --> 01:29:27,765
Speaker 9:  the public could possibly get into what they're doing. So

1356
01:29:28,065 --> 01:29:31,805
Speaker 9:  you know, it, there's three republicans on the commission now, so they were

1357
01:29:31,805 --> 01:29:34,605
Speaker 9:  always gonna have the majority, it's a five person panel when it's full.

1358
01:29:35,945 --> 01:29:39,925
Speaker 9:  So, and the chair gets to set the agenda. So it's not that

1359
01:29:39,925 --> 01:29:43,645
Speaker 9:  the Democrats would be able to kind of change the outcomes of any votes

1360
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:47,685
Speaker 9:  or anything, but they'd have access to the same documents

1361
01:29:47,685 --> 01:29:51,205
Speaker 9:  that the rest of the commissioners do. They'd be able to say in their dissenting

1362
01:29:51,205 --> 01:29:54,885
Speaker 9:  statements like, Hey, you know, this is why I think this was really wrong.

1363
01:29:55,945 --> 01:29:59,005
Speaker 9:  And without that, you know, we will never really know.

1364
01:29:59,315 --> 01:30:02,685
Speaker 5:  There's also just like stymies the commission, I, I think one thing that's

1365
01:30:02,685 --> 01:30:06,285
Speaker 5:  overlooked, and this is true at the FCC as well, like a lot of what

1366
01:30:06,545 --> 01:30:10,125
Speaker 5:  the commission does is boring bipartisan stuff.

1367
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:14,685
Speaker 5:  And that day-to-day work now just grinds to a

1368
01:30:14,755 --> 01:30:18,125
Speaker 5:  halt in, in, in some respects when you're down

1369
01:30:18,785 --> 01:30:22,525
Speaker 5:  to major leaders and, and so it's like

1370
01:30:22,945 --> 01:30:26,685
Speaker 5:  the, the commission is just going to do a worse job of being the Federal

1371
01:30:26,685 --> 01:30:29,925
Speaker 5:  Trade Commission. They're going to do a worse job of enforcing the rules

1372
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:33,445
Speaker 5:  that, that universally they agree they want to enforce and

1373
01:30:34,665 --> 01:30:38,645
Speaker 5:  you know, it would be nice if this person was allowed to have

1374
01:30:38,645 --> 01:30:42,085
Speaker 5:  her job back as, as she is legally allowed

1375
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:43,165
Speaker 5:  to be there.

1376
01:30:43,675 --> 01:30:47,365
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I mean I think it al also just arguably makes it so any company that's

1377
01:30:47,365 --> 01:30:51,245
Speaker 9:  trying to sue because they didn't like what the FTC told

1378
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:55,005
Speaker 9:  them they have to do gives 'em another thing to say in court. Like, hey

1379
01:30:55,035 --> 01:30:57,685
Speaker 9:  look at this is, this is not like the normal course of things.

1380
01:30:58,385 --> 01:31:02,365
Speaker 5:  That's fascinating. I'm sure that like any court case, we've got like

1381
01:31:02,365 --> 01:31:04,405
Speaker 5:  900 appeals to go for

1382
01:31:04,405 --> 01:31:04,565
Speaker 9:  Sure.

1383
01:31:05,025 --> 01:31:05,925
Speaker 5:  I'm RIP

1384
01:31:05,925 --> 01:31:06,205
Speaker 6:  Lauren.

1385
01:31:09,105 --> 01:31:13,005
