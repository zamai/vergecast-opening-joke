Speaker 5:  Or deals coverage. The problem with the tech industry right now

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,900
Speaker 5:  is like, we're going to talk about confidence. You want to talk about laptops,

29
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,400
Speaker 5:  but an equal amount of people are interested in the cool new laptops on

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,330
Speaker 5:  a coffee techs is the torture deal. Machinations of

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,900
Speaker 5:  Ilan buying Twitter, which means that we now run like a finance site.

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,280
Speaker 5:  We run like an M and a site. It's good. We've I've always thought

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,830
Speaker 5:  our futures, hardcore wall street coverage.

34
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,850
Speaker 3:  I know more about the sec now than I did a couple of weeks

35
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,180
Speaker 3:  ago.

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,810
Speaker 5:  I know more jokes that the SCCs name could stand for,

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,710
Speaker 5:  just cause of Ilan speed. Anyhow, there's a lot going on this week. It is

38
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,070
Speaker 5:  true. There's Computex. There's more on Twitter. We get a lightening round,

39
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,410
Speaker 5:  but I'm the lie. I'm your friend. David Pierce is here.

40
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,730
Speaker 4:  Hi, I'm your friend who will always just tell you to go

41
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,340
Speaker 4:  ahead and buy a MacBook air no matter what you want. I will just tell you

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,760
Speaker 4:  to buy a Mac.

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,560
Speaker 5:  Look at the end of the day, though. Really again, you know, there's new airs

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,320
Speaker 5:  coming out. This is like the worst time to tell people, buy back, look here.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,000
Speaker 4:  Let's just buy a Mac quick air. It's fine.

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,230
Speaker 5:  It's just going to be fine. Fair enough. Alex. Creds is here and Alice is

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,700
Speaker 5:  going to run the whole show with us. How are you doing?

48
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,270
Speaker 3:  I'm going to be that person that tells you not to buy the MacBook air.

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,290
Speaker 5:  Just hold on.

50
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,130
Speaker 3:  Just wait.

51
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,840
Speaker 4:  Alex tells you to build your own PC

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,460
Speaker 3:  Yourself.

53
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,930
Speaker 5:  Those are actually like the two farthest ends of the traditional PC

54
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,370
Speaker 5:  spectrum. You understand? Yeah.

55
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,970
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I also think they might be the only options. Like, I don't know that

56
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,850
Speaker 4:  there's anyone who exists between those two sides of the spectrum,

57
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,710
Speaker 3:  Hewlett Packard, the whole company.

58
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,580
Speaker 5:  Alright, there is a lot going on. Like I said, there's Computex this week.

59
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,180
Speaker 5:  So lots of copies. Next news. Liz is gonna come on. We're gonna talk about

60
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,170
Speaker 5:  Ilan and Twitter and where that deal is. And then I think

61
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,100
Speaker 5:  we're just going to spend about two hours talking about Amazon, adding a

62
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,000
Speaker 5:  USB-C port to the fire, seven tablet. Does that seem like us? Like we would

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,310
Speaker 5:  just, that's what we would land on for the last two hours of the show.

64
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,060
Speaker 4:  It is the thing in the rundown that made me go yes, as I was reading it.

65
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,820
Speaker 4:  So I don't know what to make of that, but here we are,

66
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,420
Speaker 5:  David, I think you put this rundown together. There's no project Jenna five

67
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,490
Speaker 5:  SIS news on here. Well, it's a real missed

68
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,080
Speaker 4:  It. It's

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,040
Speaker 5:  Our nation's fourth 5g network stumbles.

70
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,750
Speaker 4:  My favorite sort of running thing about the tech industry is

71
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,570
Speaker 4:  everybody's bad slides. And unfortunately there were no bad slides

72
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,250
Speaker 5:  To read.

73
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,630
Speaker 4:  There were no bad slides. And so, yeah, we're just, we're just stuck in Vegas

74
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,620
Speaker 4:  with no service ever.

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,430
Speaker 5:  I'm just going to look at my new favorite site, which is fierce wireless.com,

76
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,090
Speaker 5:  which is a hardcore trade publication for the wireless industry. I'll see.

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,600
Speaker 5:  Look here some news. I see. What were you doing, David? Did he know that

78
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,170
Speaker 5:  the new director of the national spectrum consortium is issued some comments

79
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,680
Speaker 5:  on RM

80
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,410
Speaker 3:  Or are they good comments, bad comments?

81
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,410
Speaker 4:  What they are is not important. It's just that they exist.

82
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,980
Speaker 5:  It's just, when you see the NSC, you don't think the national spectrum consortium

83
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,420
Speaker 5:  like no, actually the national security council would say anything about

84
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,610
Speaker 5:  This industry. Trade pub got into it. Anyway. They're confident that they

85
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,520
Speaker 5:  will accelerate the development of next generation. Technology is critical

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,230
Speaker 5:  to support us competitiveness in case you're wondering what the status of

87
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,810
Speaker 5:  is. That's good. I know all of our listeners are worried about the status

88
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,890
Speaker 5:  of RN. I think

89
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,310
Speaker 4:  They are.

90
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,400
Speaker 5:  David's like, you know, like we're spinning up these new episodes of Kyle Scott,

91
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,820
Speaker 5:  her mini series, where she's like, ploop Hadoop is gonna make you a track

92
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,660
Speaker 5:  ball. I'm going to do one. That's just like a deep

93
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,530
Speaker 5:  dive on over,

94
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,400
Speaker 4:  You know, that thing on the office. Where, where Ryan just opens up a word

95
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,090
Speaker 4:  document, writes a fake URL at the top and gives it to creed for his own

96
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,720
Speaker 4:  blog. We're going to give you a podcast. That's just for you.

97
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,170
Speaker 4:  It's going to be, it's going to be nine hours long and it is not going to

98
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,810
Speaker 4:  be, it's not going to be safe for the broader internet.

99
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,570
Speaker 5:  Andrew and I are going to get together or we're gonna make a cover song of

100
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,700
Speaker 5:  Iran by flock of seagulls, but about

101
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,290
Speaker 4:  Okay, that in it too,

102
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,920
Speaker 5:  All I'm saying is I'm obsessed with this wireless technology. I hope you

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,640
Speaker 5:  are too. If you work at the Orn association, leaky some

104
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,150
Speaker 5:  documents, that could be a way for us to become friends,

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,260
Speaker 5:  you and me together. All right, let's get out of the realm of the theoretical

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,250
Speaker 5:  and into the realm of the extremely real, which is hardcore windows, laptops,

107
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,060
Speaker 5:  David, your, this is a long list of

108
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,520
Speaker 5:  hardcore windows. Well, I guess there's a couple of Chromebooks in the mix.

109
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,450
Speaker 4:  This is the time

110
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,850
Speaker 5:  What's going on at Computex. Tell people what Computex is.

111
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,810
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So Computex is a huge, like truly

112
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,800
Speaker 4:  huge conference that happens every year in Taiwan.

113
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,460
Speaker 4:  And basically this week, I think along with CES is

114
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,770
Speaker 4:  probably the time when we get like the peak

115
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,490
Speaker 4:  into computers, like, like good old fashioned

116
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,390
Speaker 4:  computers. And like CES is like a TV and car show.

117
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,470
Speaker 4:  Computex is when people are just like 13 inch laptops, let's do

118
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,830
Speaker 4:  this. And then they just like throw them out of a truck at you. This year

119
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,640
Speaker 4:  was both like, I mean, to be honest, I don't know what I expect because

120
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,120
Speaker 4:  it's laptops like laptops, our laptops, our laptops. And we had that like

121
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,970
Speaker 4:  one cool phase a bunch of years ago where everybody tried to change things

122
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,570
Speaker 4:  and then nothing has really changed. And now there was a ton of news. There

123
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,630
Speaker 4:  are a bunch of new laptops, including a bunch of really good ones. And I

124
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,500
Speaker 4:  would say generally speaking, not a lot of like wild,

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,890
Speaker 4:  new ideas about laptops. So we basically have, you have companies like

126
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,210
Speaker 4:  Acer and a Seuss who are just out here launching every laptop they

127
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,790
Speaker 4:  can possibly think of. And the big upgrade this year is they're all going

128
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,570
Speaker 4:  from 11th generation Intel processors to 12th generation Intel processors,

129
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,440
Speaker 4:  which is a big deal, big performance, big battery. It's all very exciting.

130
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,220
Speaker 4:  It's also just the thing that happens every time. There's new

131
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,700
Speaker 4:  intelligent.

132
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,170
Speaker 3:  I mean, you say that nothing big happened, but it looks like

133
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,010
Speaker 3:  Acer has a laptop. That's going to have 3d content on it.

134
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,130
Speaker 3:  That seems very 2009

135
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,940
Speaker 5:  Laptop that'll make you dizzy. We are definitely in the

136
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,390
Speaker 5:  part of the tech hardware cycle where they

137
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,260
Speaker 5:  assume that people who are around for these ideas 10 years ago

138
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,770
Speaker 5:  are like have children or jobs,

139
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,790
Speaker 5:  you know? Like they're like you, they won't remember. And I was like, no,

140
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,630
Speaker 5:  we're still here, bro. Like, it's really true. I remember when you tried

141
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,770
Speaker 5:  to do stereoscopic display.

142
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But now they're burying it under more complicated terms.

143
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,050
Speaker 4:  I think the one for this one. So it's the, it's the Acer predator.

144
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,650
Speaker 4:  Helio's 300, which is an unbelievably great man for a laptop.

145
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,790
Speaker 5:  It is a great

146
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,630
Speaker 4:  Name. I'm super in on that. It's a 15.6 inch laptop

147
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,740
Speaker 4:  has a 4k display. And the, the description of

148
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,490
Speaker 4:  how, of what Acer did is it has a liquid crystal lenticular

149
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,270
Speaker 4:  lens, optically bonded on top of it. And it can toggle between 2d and

150
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,260
Speaker 4:  3d modes. Does that sound cool as hell? Yes. Does it mean

151
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,800
Speaker 4:  anything? Almost certainly not. And are you going to want to use it? No,

152
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,870
Speaker 4:  but it sounds rad. So I'm into it. I don't care.

153
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,770
Speaker 5:  So the lenticular lens is the thing that lets it send

154
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,580
Speaker 5:  images out in two different directions. That is a very familiar,

155
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,340
Speaker 5:  you've seen one of these before in your life. I think what they're doing

156
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,520
Speaker 5:  is they're when I say optically blocks, what they mean is our glue is really

157
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,880
Speaker 5:  cool.

158
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,430
Speaker 5:  It's fast. So they've glued it. They've laminated it very tightly to the

159
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,430
Speaker 5:  main display. And then they've got this additional time. Monica did a whole

160
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,180
Speaker 5:  writeup of this text, facial labs in like last year, like

161
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,050
Speaker 5:  almost exactly a year ago. She like went and like did the piece on

162
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,830
Speaker 5:  special labs and Acer the questions. She then was like, oh, this demo is

163
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,380
Speaker 5:  really cool. When are you going to ship it? What are people going to use

164
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,890
Speaker 5:  it for? And they were like 3d design, some answers.

165
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,030
Speaker 5:  She actually had only sent one to her, but it's very much like now they're

166
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,460
Speaker 5:  shipping one and they're, they're like 50 games appears

167
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,550
Speaker 4:  Like the, with the promise of more to come, which is one of those sentences

168
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,590
Speaker 4:  that you just hear like a want, want at the end of

169
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
Speaker 3:  51 games.

170
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,300
Speaker 4:  Exactly. But I think that's the thing with all of this and this is true of

171
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,840
Speaker 4:  like, there's a lot of this happening in the PC space right now where there's

172
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,810
Speaker 4:  stuff coming that you're like, oh, that's neat. And they're like, will it

173
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,470
Speaker 4:  change anything about how I do anything? No. It's like, I, that's how I felt

174
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,890
Speaker 4:  about the 360 hinges on laptops that have been coming around for forever.

175
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,190
Speaker 4:  You look at it and it's like, oh, that's cool. I can, you know, I can prop

176
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,970
Speaker 4:  it up like a tent. And that's like, sort of, it's neat in a, in a

177
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,810
Speaker 4:  way, but I have never once in my life, I think I would die of joy

178
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,590
Speaker 4:  if I like walked into Starbucks and somebody was using their Lenovo yoga

179
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,040
Speaker 4:  in tent mode, nothing, I would, I would shake their hand and ask them many

180
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,370
Speaker 4:  questions.

181
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,310
Speaker 5:  Do you remember when Lenova would like put on the icons of the modes in the

182
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,700
Speaker 5:  marketing? They'd be like, oh yeah, tent mode, wide mode and wide mode was

183
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,630
Speaker 5:  just like laying totally flat for no reason. Like flipped around mode. You

184
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,720
Speaker 5:  know, like they'd actually drawn icons for all of this. Here's my theory

185
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,710
Speaker 5:  about all of this. All of this is designed by people

186
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,670
Speaker 5:  who have cool jobs, you know, like you're a laptop designer. You

187
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,030
Speaker 5:  have like a stereotypically cool job. Like if you were cast in a

188
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,940
Speaker 5:  romcom and you're like, what's the cool job for your character in the wrong.

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,990
Speaker 5:  I'm like laptop designers, like on the list. Yup. It's right up there

190
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,230
Speaker 5:  with like print magazine editor who just circles things on the glass wall,

191
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,410
Speaker 5:  which is my dream. I've been doing this for 10 years. I've never circled

192
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,700
Speaker 5:  one thing on a glass wall. And

193
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,790
Speaker 4:  Have you carried a large binder full of loose leaf paper with all of the

194
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,510
Speaker 4:  magazine inside?

195
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,870
Speaker 5:  No. And every now and again, people ask me when I'm, if like, are you going

196
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,210
Speaker 5:  to leave early? Like you happy there? I'm like, well, I haven't circled anything

197
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,960
Speaker 5:  on a wall yet. So we've got a ways to go for. I've reached my

198
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,710
Speaker 5:  goals, but right. You have these serious stereotypical jobs. And so you imagine

199
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,700
Speaker 5:  these moments when like someone like takes their laptop and they put

200
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,690
Speaker 5:  it into tent mode or like, they're like, hang on, let

201
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,350
Speaker 5:  me push this button. And then like the building flies out of the front of

202
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,170
Speaker 5:  the laptop and spins around in 3d. And you're like, this is the

203
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,820
Speaker 5:  coolest, not only did I have a cool job, but I had a cool piece of

204
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,730
Speaker 5:  hardware that enables me to do my cool job in the coolest, possible way.

205
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,690
Speaker 5:  And then in real life, most people are like, my job is Excel.

206
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,620
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And when I actually do 3d design, I need a very powerful computer.

207
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Speaker 5:  That's plugged into the wall, which I think is how you get from that demo

208
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,970
Speaker 5:  to 50 games.

209
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,940
Speaker 4:  I think that's right. And that's fine and good for that device.

210
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,570
Speaker 3:  3d is actually the best thing to ever happen to Excel. Right?

211
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,410
Speaker 5:  If you, if you're one of the 3d Excel fans up there, can I, the

212
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,180
Speaker 3:  Numbers just flying at your face,

213
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,000
Speaker 5:  These tables really do pivot.

214
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,360
Speaker 5:  Can I just say this? We did the decoder episode with cat Norton,

215
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,020
Speaker 5:  miss Excel. And I was like, maybe the third piece of media she'd ever done,

216
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,050
Speaker 5:  but it wasn't. So we weren't first what he means and she's wonderful. And

217
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,890
Speaker 5:  she deserves all of her success, but that episode like went viral. And so

218
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,880
Speaker 5:  now, like months later, the financial times is writing stories

219
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,720
Speaker 5:  about Excel and tech talk because it is just sort of like bled its way

220
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,590
Speaker 5:  through the media

221
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,850
Speaker 5:  of like one of the most stuffy, just financial publications. It's like

222
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,190
Speaker 5:  Excel is on Tik TOK. You guys.

223
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,290
Speaker 4:  So the learning here is that Excel is like, they always say, you know, porn

224
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,450
Speaker 4:  drives new technology. Like, no, no, no it's actually Excel.

225
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,380
Speaker 5:  Yeah. One of the real theses of Dakota is like, every job is Excel. And if

226
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,650
Speaker 5:  I just spend an hour with you, you will admit to me when your job turns into.

227
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,090
Speaker 4:  But no, I think that the thing that was interesting to me about Computex

228
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,150
Speaker 4:  was exactly that thing that you just said, right? Where there's like all

229
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,000
Speaker 4:  these mifty things that everybody is perpetually working on. And we see this

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,770
Speaker 4:  to CES every year, two, there's like three bonkers new

231
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,190
Speaker 4:  ideas about how you can put a screen and a keyboard together.

232
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,450
Speaker 4:  And what it turns out, people actually want is just a laptop. But then you

233
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,420
Speaker 4:  get a couple of things. Like there was Acer has this new thing called the

234
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,290
Speaker 4:  spin seven, 14 that Monica on our team who has basically seen every

235
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,620
Speaker 4:  laptop that exists is super excited about. And it's basically just like,

236
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,160
Speaker 4:  they took a good Chromebook and made it nice looking,

237
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,360
Speaker 4:  which sounds like a relatively small thing, but it's not at all a small

238
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,050
Speaker 4:  thing. And like that's cool and exciting. And then you have like the HP

239
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,800
Speaker 4:  Spectre, which is, I think like for years now, one of the sort of go

240
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,070
Speaker 4:  to, if you're going to buy a windows laptop, it's like the XPS 13 and the

241
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,560
Speaker 4:  spectrum X 360, like just buy one of those. We'll be very happy.

242
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,800
Speaker 5:  Wait, I'm sorry. You think this computer looks good?

243
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,130
Speaker 3:  I mean, have you seen a normal Acer Chromebook? Yeah.

244
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But they're in there in the competition with a new hot look in HP

245
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,630
Speaker 5:  spectra Chromebook. Right. Which is like a, it's a, it's a thousand dollars,

246
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,630
Speaker 5:  but that thing looks great. I'm just looking at a picture of this. And I'm

247
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,440
Speaker 5:  telling you that on the bottom right corner of the display, there is a

248
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,570
Speaker 5:  giant HTMI sticker.

249
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,650
Speaker 3:  We gotta know

250
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:30,760
Speaker 5:  Like,

251
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,300
Speaker 4:  No you're, I will say you're actually missing the worst part, which is

252
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,200
Speaker 4:  that above the display on the left, it

253
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,410
Speaker 4:  says in, in teeny tiny little letters, it says

254
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,190
Speaker 4:  anti-microbial corn and gorilla glass at the very top left of the

255
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,550
Speaker 4:  screen.

256
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,690
Speaker 5:  This is like, they couldn't get the good stickers. So they took any

257
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,590
Speaker 5:  money, you know, like the HD my foundation was like, yeah, we got

258
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,340
Speaker 5:  20 bucks. So that got us a slot, you know? And it's like, it's the ad that

259
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,030
Speaker 5:  would normally be on like the back of the NASCAR, like underneath the

260
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,870
Speaker 5:  tailpipe, like that's the money? And they're like, no, no,

261
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,060
Speaker 5:  actually on this computer, you can have it right on the front.

262
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,830
Speaker 3:  No, everyone will know.

263
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,880
Speaker 5:  Also I can't believe this is true. That the HTMI sticker is

264
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,970
Speaker 5:  not on the same side of the computer as the HD of my parents.

265
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,120
Speaker 3:  It's just telling you it's exists.

266
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,950
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it has HTMI but a

267
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,070
Speaker 5:  Plug somewhere here is HTA,

268
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,470
Speaker 5:  look, I'm in the market for a new, so this is $750, which is expensive

269
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,040
Speaker 5:  for a Chromebook. But it is also true that the HP, the new HP one is like

270
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,510
Speaker 5:  floating at a thousand and above.

271
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And this one, like the specs on this one are very good. It's like a

272
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,560
Speaker 4:  like high level, Current gen Intel processor, like good storage,

273
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,590
Speaker 4:  good Ram. Like it's just a good computer, which you can't say have a lot

274
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,950
Speaker 4:  of Chromebooks

275
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,780
Speaker 5:  As an HD. My port,

276
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,310
Speaker 3:  Not a lot of can say that.

277
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,390
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And this one actually says it to you every time you look

278
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,350
Speaker 5:  at it, look, I'm in love with a high end powerful Chromebook. That looks

279
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,340
Speaker 5:  cool. So I'll put this on my little, my little Stu list, but it's going to

280
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,300
Speaker 5:  come with like the gorilla or what's the stuff the Google on. Can

281
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,170
Speaker 5:  I say the, the first one it talks about is the Rog Flo X 60 in the

282
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,040
Speaker 5:  Seuss. And what's actually the display. Isn't all. These

283
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,370
Speaker 5:  are fascinating. So we talked about the one that does a spatial 3d.

284
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,570
Speaker 5:  This one mini led display with 512 dimming zones. Mini

285
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,170
Speaker 5:  led is starting to come down. Right? The macro crows had them. Macro crows

286
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,230
Speaker 5:  are obviously a little bit more expensive. I think it's fascinating to see,

287
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,220
Speaker 5:  okay, this display styles coming down and then there's one with a

288
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,860
Speaker 5:  new Olin. There's like a inexpensive Ola display.

289
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,510
Speaker 4:  That's called the Acer swift three

290
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,500
Speaker 3:  Affordable. Owlette like $750,

291
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,280
Speaker 3:  800.

292
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,110
Speaker 5:  How big is that screen?

293
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,130
Speaker 4:  It's a 14 inch. It's 8 99. And substantially cheaper

294
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,000
Speaker 4:  than your average OLED laptop. And it looks really nice. And yeah,

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,930
Speaker 4:  that's one of the things like outside of all the wacky shit that

296
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,800
Speaker 4:  everybody is perpetually trying to do, like just give us better. Screens

297
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,030
Speaker 4:  seems like that's that one's actually happening. It's like make the processors

298
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,810
Speaker 4:  faster or make the screens better. Make the keyboards not horrible. Like

299
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,940
Speaker 4:  that is the recipe for a pretty good laptop.

300
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,320
Speaker 3:  The prices are interesting too, because for the longest time, like most laptops

301
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,310
Speaker 3:  sold were like under $500. Everybody just wants cheap 10 ADP,

302
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,210
Speaker 3:  15 inch display. Great. And now we've got a lot

303
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,930
Speaker 3:  of sub thousand dollar laptops with like high-end

304
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,190
Speaker 3:  monitors in them. And that's cool. Like an old ed for under a grand.

305
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Would not have thought of that ever.

306
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,830
Speaker 5:  Can I, can I tell you this story? We, so we had the guy

307
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,760
Speaker 5:  Alan Young on decoder, the Fox son guy, then Josh Tris and I, a couple of

308
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,660
Speaker 5:  days after the episode, we took a call from a guy who's been in the display

309
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,380
Speaker 5:  industry for a long time. Cantankerous, older gentlemen. He was like

310
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,590
Speaker 5:  Fox homeless, always a lie. They're never building anything. I know all these

311
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,830
Speaker 5:  stories. We got to take this call. So getting a call and we're like expecting

312
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,740
Speaker 5:  to hear whatever it was. Good call. I'm not going to reveal everything he

313
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,370
Speaker 5:  said, but it was like old school display, manufacturing,

314
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,210
Speaker 5:  executive called to tell us I've been following your coverage. Here's some

315
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,210
Speaker 5:  things you missed, go chase it down. I know these guys. It was obvious to

316
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,390
Speaker 5:  everybody in the industry. They're not living in a factory. And then he's

317
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,320
Speaker 5:  like, I know people like OLEDs, and I know you like your

318
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,590
Speaker 5:  mini LEDs, but I'll see, these are just always going to win. You can always

319
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,200
Speaker 5:  just build them. They're getting better and faster. And I started laughing.

320
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,630
Speaker 5:  He's like, why are you laughing? I was like, my whole house has OLEDs in

321
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,530
Speaker 5:  many of them. There's four TVs in the house. Three of them are,

322
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,250
Speaker 5:  or one of them is plasma. There's two overheads. And my, you know, my laptop's

323
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,670
Speaker 5:  annuities. And he's like, how are you? I tell your readers,

324
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,580
Speaker 5:  don't buy the TVs I'm buying. It was just like

325
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,650
Speaker 6:  The harshest of broken I've ever.

326
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,590
Speaker 4:  The whole case is just, we're going to keep making LCDs.

327
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,160
Speaker 5:  He was like, plasma was a flash in the fucking pan. And you know, there's

328
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,260
Speaker 5:  all that stuff. They're never gonna get brighter. They're all going to die.

329
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,220
Speaker 5:  People are gonna realize it was a disaster LCDs. That's, that's always the

330
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,730
Speaker 5:  future. And I was like, you know, I got, I like, like my eligibility is like,

331
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,250
Speaker 5:  tell your readers, don't buy what you're buying.

332
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,880
Speaker 4:  Wow. See, this is the stuff that happens at trade shows. The, the, like it's

333
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,690
Speaker 4:  like some sharks and jets stuff. Like there's like no

334
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,170
Speaker 4:  lead crew walks into the bar that the LCD crew is already in. And then like

335
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,650
Speaker 4:  things get quiet. And there's, it's like, it's a scene. This is what happens

336
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,580
Speaker 4:  at Computex. Every year,

337
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,390
Speaker 5:  Every year coffee texts, there is a musical theater fight

338
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,690
Speaker 5:  between display manufacturers. They're

339
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,880
Speaker 4:  Just hammering TVs over each other's heads.

340
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,660
Speaker 5:  All right, let's talk about these two, this super bulky

341
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,660
Speaker 5:  Chromebook. I just think the fact that Chromebooks are, they're starting

342
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,960
Speaker 5:  to hit new form factors outside of the, we made a $300 one to throw in your

343
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,920
Speaker 5:  kid's classroom and get destroyed. So now they've got Acer

344
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,370
Speaker 5:  has got this Chromebook tab five 10, which has LTE, which is

345
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,360
Speaker 5:  fascinating for a Chromebook for many reasons. It's also just

346
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,190
Speaker 5:  like super rugged.

347
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The idea is basically like it's a, I think it's 400 bucks and it's

348
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,140
Speaker 4:  not a particularly like impressive looking for a

349
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,980
Speaker 4:  super powerful device. It's running on the Qualcomm Snapdragon seven C

350
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,370
Speaker 4:  chip, which is basically, this is designed to be a much more like mobile

351
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,210
Speaker 4:  thing and in their press release and stuff, Acer talks about it as like a

352
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,660
Speaker 4:  mobile, like video conferencing system.

353
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,470
Speaker 5:  So it's a mobile device running a Google operating

354
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,250
Speaker 5:  system with the cell radio. That's designed to

355
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,180
Speaker 5:  make calls

356
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,000
Speaker 4:  Kohan.

357
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,140
Speaker 5:  I'm just saying like they made a seven inch Android phone.

358
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:31,890
Speaker 4:  Yes.

359
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,080
Speaker 5:  But it runs chromo S

360
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,250
Speaker 3:  It's 10.1 inches.

361
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,790
Speaker 5:  So it's 10.1. Sorry. It has the exact same

362
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,750
Speaker 5:  aspect ratio. It was the nexus seven. And I assumed that it is exactly that

363
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,980
Speaker 5:  size in every picture,

364
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,020
Speaker 3:  Much larger pixels.

365
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,560
Speaker 4:  Well, and it's, it's weird that that others are doing this cause like Google,

366
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,010
Speaker 4:  as we talked about on the show is it has this very specific idea about what

367
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,950
Speaker 4:  criminal is for. Right. They see it as like an enterprise thing and an education

368
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,620
Speaker 4:  thing. And I, Frick Costello basically said exactly that to me. And they

369
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,400
Speaker 4:  think of Android as the mass consumer may and

370
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,180
Speaker 4:  thing. And also Android is so much better tuned

371
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,020
Speaker 4:  to like mobile systems. Like you can also make video

372
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,740
Speaker 4:  calls on your phone, which has LTE. Some of them even have a

373
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,400
Speaker 4:  stylist and a keyboard, like it's crazy. But yeah. So the, the

374
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,670
Speaker 4:  existence of this thing from Acer, I think is a,

375
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,720
Speaker 4:  nobody throws computers against the wall, like is her does.

376
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,650
Speaker 4:  So I sorta love it for that anyway, but also just the idea that everybody

377
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,950
Speaker 4:  is still out there experimenting even as Google is trying to like segment

378
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,040
Speaker 4:  chromo S into this teeny tiny little box is really interesting to me.

379
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,270
Speaker 3:  This is supposed to be the, the video Chromebook when it's

380
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,210
Speaker 3:  has a five megapixel webcam.

381
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,650
Speaker 5:  I mean, have you seen any apple webcam people crash shop in this room? Be

382
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,390
Speaker 5:  like, what? I've it's cheap. I can shoot a gun at it.

383
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,490
Speaker 3:  You could probably shoot a gun at this. And it would be okay,

384
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,660
Speaker 5:  So

385
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,260
Speaker 3:  Thick.

386
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,970
Speaker 5:  It's a chunk.

387
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,860
Speaker 3:  It's got a garage for the stylists.

388
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,910
Speaker 5:  I like the little pinstripe texture on the back. And then it's not that

389
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,120
Speaker 5:  I like it so much that I'd purchase it. I'm just saying it's better than

390
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,810
Speaker 5:  the normal thing.

391
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,800
Speaker 3:  It's very 2014. Yeah. It just looks like this would have

392
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,340
Speaker 3:  been super cool in 2014 and eight years later,

393
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,780
Speaker 3:  it just is existing.

394
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,680
Speaker 5:  Here's what it's like. We have LTE guys. You heard about the fourth

395
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,440
Speaker 5:  G the cranes. I gonna talk to you about the sort of chip situation, all of

396
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,020
Speaker 5:  these. But lastly, we should talk about their framework, which they, with

397
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,500
Speaker 5:  you dove into, this is a modular laptop that we've covered for a long time.

398
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,020
Speaker 5:  It seems like they're, they're living up to their promise in some ways.

399
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,770
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So the framework laptop launched a little over a year

400
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,640
Speaker 4:  ago and its whole thing is basically it's a relatively normal

401
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,630
Speaker 4:  laptop. Like not, no crazy ideas about laptops, no super new specs,

402
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,980
Speaker 4:  but it's whole thing is being modular and repairable and upgradable.

403
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,010
Speaker 4:  So their whole idea is you shouldn't have to buy a new laptop every time

404
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,880
Speaker 4:  you want a new laptop. And they came out this year with, they

405
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,480
Speaker 4:  call it a new framework laptop. But basically all it is is a

406
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,020
Speaker 4:  new main board. And it has the 12th generation Intel chip.

407
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,400
Speaker 4:  It's faster. It has all of this stuff. You can buy it in a new body if you

408
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,210
Speaker 4:  want, but you could also just slot it into your existing framework laptop.

409
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,930
Speaker 4:  And that is a really big deal framework made the same

410
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,780
Speaker 4:  promises that a million other companies have made over the years, right?

411
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,110
Speaker 4:  There's project Daraa Intel has done this a bunch of times, everybody has

412
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,720
Speaker 4:  tried to make watches or gadgets and everybody gives up on them immediately.

413
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,480
Speaker 4:  And framework at least is like out here doing the

414
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,710
Speaker 5:  Thing that made the one

415
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,980
Speaker 3:  It's different than like Alienware and MSI and what all those guys were doing

416
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,790
Speaker 3:  a couple of years ago where they were putting like <inaudible> processors,

417
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,300
Speaker 3:  desktop processors into laptops. Like these are actual laptop processes.

418
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Basically they're, they're taking the, like the Intel, you know, the

419
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,870
Speaker 4:  12th generation, the <inaudible> and the ice Evans. And they'll just sell

420
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,680
Speaker 4:  you the main board and you just, you just stick it in where everything else

421
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,440
Speaker 4:  is and all the stuff that you can screw, all the parts in and out. They have

422
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,070
Speaker 4:  little ports for expansion stuffs. If you want an HTMI port, you put it in

423
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,820
Speaker 4:  ether, net, you put it in. It's just, it's a little box that you fill with

424
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,760
Speaker 4:  all the computer parts that you want. And it's kind of cool. Cause it's like,

425
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,330
Speaker 4:  it's a new computer, but it's also just like new parts for your old computer

426
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,570
Speaker 4:  that make it a new computer, which is just like wacky new paradigm of thinking

427
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,180
Speaker 4:  about how people buy computers that I think is very cool.

428
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,320
Speaker 3:  Old paradigm.

429
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,010
Speaker 4:  I mean fair.

430
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,670
Speaker 3:  There was the best laptop ever made. Did this,

431
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,840
Speaker 4:  The Motorola matrix,

432
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,090
Speaker 3:  The apple G three PowerBook Pismo

433
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,290
Speaker 5:  Pull the keyboard right off. Oh yeah. Yeah. This is a particularly

434
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,250
Speaker 5:  weird era of Johnny ive keyboards. Like we think that we live

435
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,430
Speaker 5:  through the butterfly era and that was really bad, but that's because all

436
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,940
Speaker 5:  of you are just too young to have lived through that era where he was like,

437
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,750
Speaker 5:  what if it was a tiny wafer of nothing and you could also

438
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,500
Speaker 5:  remove it completely resulting in this springy. His

439
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,170
Speaker 5:  keyboard made also, it will be slightly translucent. So remember that was

440
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,860
Speaker 5:  like, it was like translucent brown. But so when you pulled it off, you could

441
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,420
Speaker 5:  do the airport card. You could do Ram

442
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,190
Speaker 3:  And you could do the processor,

443
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,300
Speaker 5:  You could do the processor.

444
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,490
Speaker 3:  So other world computing. Right.

445
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,010
Speaker 5:  Okay. So some like other people did the processes. Yes.

446
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,700
Speaker 3:  Some other people made it so you could switch it out because I had that

447
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,540
Speaker 3:  laptop for like four or five. Like I had it for over 10 years because I just

448
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,440
Speaker 3:  replaced the, the old crummy T3 with a slightly less crabby,

449
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,280
Speaker 3:  G three and then a G4. And then the

450
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,860
Speaker 3:  internet started to exist in the computer died.

451
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,670
Speaker 5:  Did you have the moment of upgrading that

452
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,210
Speaker 5:  laptop where like starting up every time was like a little bit of an

453
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:26,870
Speaker 5:  adventure?

454
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:27,830
Speaker 3:  Yes.

455
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,640
Speaker 5:  Cause I had a, I had a G4 tower and I upgraded like all the

456
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,270
Speaker 5:  Ram and I swapped out the processor and the video card and by the end I'd

457
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,730
Speaker 5:  be like, I can't turn off my computer.

458
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,620
Speaker 3:  It might never

459
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:39,990
Speaker 5:  Turn on.

460
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,700
Speaker 3:  Like you just did never restarted it. If it restarted. You're like, well,

461
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,410
Speaker 3:  time to go buy a new laptop.

462
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like you look at the jar of change. We're like, I hope that there's

463
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,370
Speaker 5:  nothing there. So you get a max, it doesn't look exactly like Mac book pro

464
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,510
Speaker 5:  or metric error. Right.

465
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,710
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And they're like, I think basically okay. With that idea, like

466
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,580
Speaker 4:  the, the, when I talked to, to Nerov the founder of framework a

467
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,150
Speaker 4:  while back, he was basically like we've the, the industry has gotten a lot

468
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,330
Speaker 4:  of things about laptops, right? Like we don't need to screw those things

469
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,900
Speaker 4:  up while we try to also do this other thing. Like let's just make a laptop

470
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,540
Speaker 4:  that is nice. And it looks nice. But also does these other things, which

471
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,920
Speaker 4:  I a hundred percent think is the right approach.

472
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,700
Speaker 5:  And they changed the, the top cover. Can you replace the top cover if you

473
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,510
Speaker 5:  have the old one too?

474
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,660
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So framework will actually sell you, they call it an upgrade kit. And

475
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,590
Speaker 4:  I think it's 580 bucks or something that is basically

476
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,580
Speaker 4:  the new main board and the top cover. And the big knock on the first version

477
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,540
Speaker 4:  was just that it felt kind of, I don't know, flaky, like it just didn't feel

478
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,140
Speaker 4:  like a particularly solid laptop, which is a possibility for something that

479
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,110
Speaker 4:  is basically just a bunch of pieces screwed together. Like they didn't do

480
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,470
Speaker 4:  any particularly impressive building. So

481
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,820
Speaker 4:  to have it be a little more rigid, like it just took them time. But the

482
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,060
Speaker 4:  idea is now they've like, I dunno, done something to the process. So the

483
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,310
Speaker 4:  top covers a little more rigid and they'll sell you that too, if you want.

484
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,060
Speaker 4:  Or you can just buy like the whole new package, which comes with that new

485
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,330
Speaker 4:  top.

486
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,660
Speaker 5:  Lots of new laptops, lots of new chips. The framework is interesting. Right?

487
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,900
Speaker 5:  It's a new, more powerful chip in the same cooling setup as the old one,

488
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,350
Speaker 5:  Alex, what should we be thinking about chips and all these new computers?

489
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,860
Speaker 3:  I mean, we sold these chips. Like what back in February, I think is when

490
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,920
Speaker 3:  they announced all of this stuff. So it was kind of like exciting to finally

491
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,760
Speaker 3:  see them in the things I think right now the other question is how good

492
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,940
Speaker 3:  actually are they right? Like how good are they doing on battery life? However,

493
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,170
Speaker 3:  everything else Acer historically is one of the first like folks out of the

494
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,040
Speaker 3:  gate with, with new processors and stuff. So these will be some of the first

495
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,250
Speaker 3:  ones

496
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,240
Speaker 4:  They'll try anything.

497
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,570
Speaker 3:  They'll try anything. I mean, that's the thing it's like Acer in particular

498
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,440
Speaker 3:  loves to just try anything. They love to do anything.

499
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,470
Speaker 3:  They're just like, let's see. Cause they have just such a huge business they

500
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,990
Speaker 3:  can afford to do this. They're like what? I think they're fourth now as far

501
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,620
Speaker 3:  as laptops go, but I think there's right now. It's just, there's a lot of

502
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,400
Speaker 3:  questions. We're seeing them in stuff. We're not seeing laptops that are

503
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,210
Speaker 3:  a lot thinner or a lot chunkier. We're not seeing big changes

504
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,200
Speaker 3:  in battery size. So there's definitely some questions to be had

505
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,010
Speaker 3:  about how much faster are they actually, how much better is the battery life,

506
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,890
Speaker 3:  but we have to actually get ahold of them and start testing them. I think,

507
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,430
Speaker 4:  Am I right in thinking that how that turns out is like

508
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,660
Speaker 4:  kind of huge and important for Intel? Because I feel like we're at this

509
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,450
Speaker 4:  moment now where, you know, AMT is doing really interesting stuff, Qualcomm

510
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,540
Speaker 4:  is coming along and it feels like Intel has been making noise about, you

511
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,450
Speaker 4:  know, we're, we're getting back to winning at this stuff and it feels like

512
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,260
Speaker 4:  the elderly stuff is coming out kind of slowly. And it feels like

513
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,410
Speaker 4:  how it turns out and how some of these reviews go feel like it's going to

514
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,400
Speaker 4:  be a really big deal.

515
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,630
Speaker 3:  I think they would like it to be a big deal. I don't know how big

516
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,500
Speaker 3:  a deal it is actually going to be. Right. Like I think Intel

517
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,490
Speaker 3:  has been so behind the curve for so long that it's just

518
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,300
Speaker 3:  like, we'll, I'll be like, oh my God, they caught up. But I think there's

519
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,500
Speaker 3:  a real question of, are they going to absolutely surpass? And I think we

520
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,440
Speaker 3:  saw that with the last generation, right? The 11th generation, we started

521
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,860
Speaker 3:  to see like, oh, they're doing good work here. They've caught up with

522
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,820
Speaker 3:  AMT. So ideally this is like, are they continuing to do it?

523
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,420
Speaker 3:  Was that just a flash in the pan? Or can they continue to stay ahead of AMD?

524
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,590
Speaker 5:  And they keep making this noise about using TSMC is a fab.

525
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,760
Speaker 5:  So if they can actually decouple their designs and make a five

526
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,990
Speaker 5:  nanometre design, which is like, I mean, like

527
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,380
Speaker 5:  if you're at Intel, that's what proposed to you like

528
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,580
Speaker 5:  decoupled design from manufacturing and make a five,

529
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,000
Speaker 5:  nine meter design for TSMC to make. Like, that is just so far outside of

530
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,180
Speaker 5:  the DNA of Intel. That like that company could just have like an allergic

531
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,420
Speaker 5:  reaction to this, this idea, but that's what they're threatening to do.

532
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,590
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like, I mean, they kind of have to right there, their foundries just

533
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,520
Speaker 3:  aren't capable of producing the chips that they need to produce to stay

534
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,580
Speaker 3:  competitive in the market. And they said, well, we're going to build our

535
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,700
Speaker 3:  Silicon sun valley or whatever. They're calling the thing in Ohio.

536
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,830
Speaker 5:  It's the Silicon Hartland

537
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,760
Speaker 3:  Skews me the Silicon Heartland. Like they said, they're going to do all of

538
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,750
Speaker 3:  this stuff, but that's still years away. And I think we're

539
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,690
Speaker 3:  kind of stuck in a spot for them where they're like, yeah, the really cool

540
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,930
Speaker 3:  stuff is coming. Like we kind of have it right now.

541
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,810
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We'll see. I think the answer is we'll see, especially if that Ohio

542
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,540
Speaker 5:  factory comes online, but great that what are we going to do when we test

543
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,600
Speaker 5:  these laptops, we're going to pick them up against a bunch of M series chips

544
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,050
Speaker 5:  and say, where's the performance versus the battery life. And I think the

545
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,520
Speaker 5:  battery life is actually more important.

546
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,540
Speaker 3:  I would a hundred like battery life is where everybody's

547
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,230
Speaker 3:  going. And they've all kind of started to change their philosophy on battery

548
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,980
Speaker 3:  life too. Right. Intel for years, their whole idea was we get through the

549
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,370
Speaker 3:  processes as quickly as possible. So we save you battery life. Cause we're

550
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,000
Speaker 3:  just doing it so fast. And then you realize that that's not actually like

551
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,150
Speaker 3:  that doesn't scale. Well, because you're using so much power to get it done

552
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,130
Speaker 3:  quickly that you're still sucking up the battery, which is where this whole

553
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,040
Speaker 3:  big little core thing came from where it's like, we're going to use these

554
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,220
Speaker 3:  really efficient core. So they're, they're really changing. Like not only

555
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,030
Speaker 3:  are they changing how they're like, okay, we're going to decouple.

556
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,780
Speaker 3:  We're not going to build the chips ourselves, but also our entire fundamental

557
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,590
Speaker 3:  philosophy of how we make chips go fast and save battery life. We're going

558
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,190
Speaker 3:  to change that too. So there's like a lot of stuff they've got to prove

559
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,450
Speaker 3:  consistently. I think they've proven it like once, but they have to repeatedly

560
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,260
Speaker 3:  prove that they can do this. And it's not just a one-off because Apple's

561
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,100
Speaker 3:  already doing it. Yeah.

562
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,590
Speaker 4:  I was going to say, you say, we're going to put these things up against what

563
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,890
Speaker 4:  to M series max. And I feel like I, you know, I don't want to write reviews

564
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,550
Speaker 4:  before they get done, but I have an odd feeling. We know how those benchmarks

565
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,310
Speaker 4:  are going to go based on how this stuff has worked out relatively well.

566
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,640
Speaker 3:  I'm just lapping everybody else in the industry right now.

567
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,750
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like apple is just so far ahead at the moment. It's crazy. Like

568
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,830
Speaker 4:  I said, just buy a MacBook air.

569
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,690
Speaker 3:  Wait, please wait,

570
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,830
Speaker 4:  Get, don't buy a Mac book air now. But like in general I have

571
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,460
Speaker 3:  African six. Wait, at least until June six. Yeah.

572
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,100
Speaker 4:  That's a good call.

573
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,490
Speaker 5:  We got to take a break, was going to join us. We're talking about

574
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,950
Speaker 4:  Email. It's the tried and true method of communication for just

610
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,720
Speaker 8:  Hi, thanks for having me good to be back.

611
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,800
Speaker 5:  This is a segment that we are duty bound by law to call

612
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,430
Speaker 5:  this week and Ilan where we will be at some point in the future of

613
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,330
Speaker 5:  relaunching our newsletter that Liz started called this week in Elan.

614
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,290
Speaker 5:  We will take three verge reporters to support that newsletter. At this time,

615
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,500
Speaker 4:  I was saying to somebody earlier that I really liked the idea that this week

616
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,800
Speaker 4:  in Ilan is going to be way more than weekly. Like it just feels appropriate.

617
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,170
Speaker 4:  That that's what, that's how it's going to work

618
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,580
Speaker 8:  Our in Elan

619
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,510
Speaker 5:  This moment in Elan history, okay. Let's discuss where

620
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,590
Speaker 5:  Elon and Twitter are now. And then Elon has done and said

621
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,370
Speaker 5:  a number of other things this week that connect to this

622
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,330
Speaker 5:  deal. Don't connect to this deal, provided a provoked a

623
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,640
Speaker 5:  range of reactions. Well, let's start with the deal.

624
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,570
Speaker 8:  Well, I just want to be super clear is that the deal is still

625
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,470
Speaker 8:  happening no matter what Elon Musk says about it. Like, look, I think

626
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,040
Speaker 8:  you all know that I'm like a long time reader of Matt Levine. I've been reading

627
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,710
Speaker 8:  him since the financial crisis when he was a deal breaker.

628
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,660
Speaker 5:  Melamine is a columnist at Bloomberg.

629
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,840
Speaker 8:  Yeah, that's right. There's a thing that he said about this that I like can't

630
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,800
Speaker 8:  get out of my head, which is like, if you have to look at the contract for

631
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,790
Speaker 8:  the deal you've already lost. Yeah. And so I'm seeing all of these people

632
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,630
Speaker 8:  on Twitter who are like, oh, but he can't disparage Twitter. And it's like,

633
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,710
Speaker 8:  it's Elon Musk. He's going to do what he's going to do. The only entity that

634
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,340
Speaker 8:  can enforce the non-disparagement clause is his Twitter. And they seem

635
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,760
Speaker 8:  desperately to want to get this deal done. They've filed their proxy. They've

636
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,610
Speaker 8:  said multiple times, I think the deal is getting done. It's getting done

637
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,300
Speaker 8:  at this price. They're not renegotiating. And Ilan is just doing

638
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,930
Speaker 8:  whatever.

639
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,890
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So let's just start chronologically this week.

640
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,210
Speaker 5:  There are many ways to come at this conversation. I feel as

641
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,990
Speaker 5:  though chronologically is the only one that will provide us

642
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,570
Speaker 5:  sanity. And even then it's kind of dicey.

643
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,800
Speaker 4:  That might be too high a bar.

644
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,460
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I don't, I don't think we're going to get to sanity. We can try. Let's

645
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,360
Speaker 8:  try. So for those of you who haven't been paying attention to the stock market

646
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,140
Speaker 8:  prices have been falling. It's been kind of ugly. And

647
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,920
Speaker 8:  so now the amount that Elan was

648
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,700
Speaker 8:  planning to pay for Twitter, which was 54 20 blaze.

649
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,460
Speaker 8:  It just seems high if you will.

650
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,660
Speaker 8:  So he's been tweeting a bunch of stuff about

651
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,960
Speaker 8:  bots on Twitter, and he's like

652
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,830
Speaker 8:  concerned that there might be too many fake spam bot accounts.

653
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,670
Speaker 8:  That might be as many as 20% of Twitter's users, that the deal can't

654
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,160
Speaker 8:  move forward until Twitter proves accuracy of its

655
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,120
Speaker 8:  actual estimate, which is like 5% I think. And I just want to pause

656
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,780
Speaker 8:  here and note that in normal

657
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,650
Speaker 8:  deals, these kinds of things get ironed out without me

658
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,340
Speaker 8:  watching in a process called due diligence, which

659
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,620
Speaker 8:  Elon Musk did not do on this deal

660
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,580
Speaker 5:  Declined to do. He actually said, I'm relying on Twitter's public statements.

661
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,870
Speaker 5:  He said, this publicly,

662
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,650
Speaker 8:  People just don't want to do due diligence. And I don't understand why, because

663
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,340
Speaker 8:  then they're like, oh, I was surprised by this thing. And it's like, you

664
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,840
Speaker 8:  didn't have to be surprised.

665
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,980
Speaker 5:  Well also I will just, this is more Matt Levine quoting, cause his

666
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,640
Speaker 5:  newsletter on this stuff is great. And it also keeps her finding Elon Musk

667
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,730
Speaker 5:  as his boss because he keeps trying to go on vacation and then something

668
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,820
Speaker 5:  happens. And he's like my boss, I must mean to write the column. It's a very

669
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,450
Speaker 5:  funny bit. But his point was Elan constantly and

670
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,750
Speaker 5:  consistently complaints about bots because Elan's mentions are a

671
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,410
Speaker 5:  disaster. He replied to me last

672
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,340
Speaker 5:  weekend. And then my mentions were a disaster of crypto spam. It was

673
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,090
Speaker 5:  like bizarre. So Elan is like deeply aware of the bot

674
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,900
Speaker 5:  issue. He thinks the number is high. Then he

675
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,920
Speaker 5:  says, I'm going to buy Twitter to fix the bot problems. And now his

676
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,040
Speaker 5:  excuses, I don't want to buy Twitter because I don't believe that their reporting

677
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,700
Speaker 5:  of bots is accurate. And so Twitter for years, like eight years or

678
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,270
Speaker 5:  something right in their quarterly reports. So like less than

679
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,020
Speaker 5:  5% of our monetized daily active users are bots,

680
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,070
Speaker 4:  Which they have said is not a perfect number. We should say, like they've

681
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,370
Speaker 4:  always said, they say something about like applying significant judgment

682
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,300
Speaker 4:  to it. Cause there's no way to like perfectly poll who is real

683
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,020
Speaker 4:  and who isn't under platform, but they're extremely educated guests over

684
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,270
Speaker 4:  and over and over again has been under 5% of users,

685
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,380
Speaker 5:  Less than 5%. But the number and Liz, this is like a weird

686
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,280
Speaker 5:  number right in the industry is monetized double daily active users,

687
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,970
Speaker 5:  which doesn't map. Like when you try to compare and contrast the size of

688
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,630
Speaker 5:  Twitter to any other platform, you kind of quickly realize

689
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,100
Speaker 5:  that no one else uses that number that you

690
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,250
Speaker 5:  can't compare dailies to monthly's because monthly's are always higher. More

691
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,430
Speaker 5:  people show up in a month. You can't compare data monetize well, dailies

692
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,910
Speaker 5:  to dailies on other platforms because Twitter is only counting monetized

693
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,240
Speaker 5:  dailies, which means if you're on Twitter, on other

694
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,630
Speaker 5:  platforms, you can't be, they can't serve you ads.

695
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,400
Speaker 5:  So you don't count. So it's just this one tiny group of users. Then they're

696
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,320
Speaker 5:  saying less than 5% for all we know Elan is like

697
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,060
Speaker 5:  using his own Homeworld Twitter client and he doesn't count, right? Like,

698
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,080
Speaker 5:  so there's just like this weird numerical problem where there's no light

699
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,890
Speaker 5:  to like comparison to anything. And then there's progress

700
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,880
Speaker 5:  while the new CEO, Twitter doing lengthy thoughtful threads about how they

701
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,660
Speaker 5:  calculate the thing to which Elon just replies with a

702
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,040
Speaker 5:  single poop emoji.

703
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,620
Speaker 8:  I listen, he understands how to use Twitter. This is more than we can say

704
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,500
Speaker 8:  for certain other technology moguls out here. You know, I will

705
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,400
Speaker 8:  say though, I just, I don't buy any of this shit around

706
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,180
Speaker 8:  bots. I don't buy any of it. I think this is a negotiating

707
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,050
Speaker 8:  tactic. And like, you know, Matt Levine came out and called

708
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,560
Speaker 8:  Elan a liar. And I think it's worth mentioning that Elan has directly lied

709
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,160
Speaker 8:  to us at the verge at least once. So like, it's not like this is out of

710
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,910
Speaker 8:  character for him to be, you know, disingenuous,

711
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,660
Speaker 8:  let's say

712
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,020
Speaker 5:  You should say what the lie is.

713
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,850
Speaker 8:  Do you remember? It was like a shadow Cain story. I'm sorry, this is going

714
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,760
Speaker 8:  to take a second. I'm going to need to bring the headline up. But we had

715
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,360
Speaker 8:  asked him some question about whether this rocket launch was

716
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,320
Speaker 8:  true and in our, in his DMS back when we talked

717
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,280
Speaker 8:  to him and he said, no, and then we corrected

718
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,180
Speaker 8:  our story, which we had gotten from other sources. And then we had to

719
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,760
Speaker 8:  correct our correction because our first story was right.

720
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,260
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That seems right.

721
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,570
Speaker 5:  Like, why do you think we changed our background policy? We just need to

722
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,860
Speaker 5:  attribute the things to people who say them.

723
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,470
Speaker 4:  So I have a question about this, that one of the things that I've been trying

724
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,800
Speaker 4:  to figure out is like, I think I buy all of that logic. Right. Which is that

725
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,820
Speaker 4:  none of the shit he's searching is actually about issues that

726
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,240
Speaker 4:  he has. And it's actually about him trying to get a lower price on Twitter.

727
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,320
Speaker 4:  That makes a certain amount of logical sense. But the part that I don't understand

728
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,500
Speaker 4:  is if that's what you're going to pick, why would you pick bots? Like why

729
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,520
Speaker 4:  it's such an odd hobby horse to use, to be like your

730
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,130
Speaker 4:  wedge in this fight? Like why would it be bots? Okay.

731
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,450
Speaker 3:  A lot of his followers, bots, like we've heard about Elan's bot

732
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,440
Speaker 3:  army, like they've inflated his like reach in a lot

733
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,950
Speaker 3:  of ways. Right. They've inflated as perceived. We reach. So like bots have

734
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,880
Speaker 3:  been good to Ilan. Like maybe they've been bad to his mentions, but they've

735
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,390
Speaker 3:  been good to him overall. So I was kind of surprised that he

736
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,430
Speaker 3:  is now anti bots.

737
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,510
Speaker 8:  I have a theory about this and it has to do with cryptocurrency spam. We

738
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,110
Speaker 8:  know that as of last year, Elon Musk, impersonators had

739
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,100
Speaker 8:  stolen more than $2 million in cryptocurrency.

740
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,420
Speaker 8:  It's just the, like a lot of these bots seem to be

741
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,350
Speaker 8:  crypto scammers. And for whatever reason, when they reply

742
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,130
Speaker 8:  to Elon Musk looking like Elon Musk with the name Elon

743
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,850
Speaker 8:  Musk, but without like actually being Elon Musk, people

744
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:52,690
Speaker 8:  really do think that there's some kind of crypto giveaway that

745
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,680
Speaker 8:  Elon is doing and click. Yeah. And I can certainly

746
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,310
Speaker 8:  imagine as Musk is like super protective

747
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,090
Speaker 8:  of his army of fans, that this is the kind of

748
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:08,020
Speaker 8:  thing where saying, Hey, bots are a real problem. And I really want to

749
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,010
Speaker 8:  deal with them is kind of for them, right? Like

750
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,180
Speaker 8:  they're the ones who get hurt. And they're also crucially the ones who

751
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,080
Speaker 8:  need to be reassured that he's on the level because I found the story that

752
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,010
Speaker 8:  Musk lied about. It's from December 1st, 2017

753
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,060
Speaker 8:  and the headline is Elon Musk told us he was sending a car to space then

754
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,450
Speaker 8:  said he totally made it up. And you may all remember that he did in fact

755
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,410
Speaker 8:  send a car to space.

756
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,070
Speaker 3:  He did,

757
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,200
Speaker 5:  Which ruled. I just want to put that out there. I know that was very controversial

758
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,660
Speaker 5:  at the time. The car in space was awesome.

759
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,910
Speaker 5:  We should just be clear about that.

760
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,550
Speaker 4:  Yeah. If I assign a car to space, I would tell everyone the truth about it

761
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,030
Speaker 4:  forever.

762
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:48,980
Speaker 5:  What are you learning about?

763
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,720
Speaker 8:  So, you know, like, I, I do think that like some degree of this is about

764
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,410
Speaker 8:  his fandom, which he like really does seem to care about a lot. And

765
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,560
Speaker 8:  like he needs to have a good

766
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,490
Speaker 8:  excuse for why he can back out of the Twitter deal. Not

767
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,670
Speaker 8:  for Twitter. Cause I don't think he gives a shit about Twitter, but for them.

768
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,080
Speaker 8:  So he's still the good guy.

769
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,790
Speaker 5:  He isn't a little narrative.

770
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,750
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And so like, like I think this is a transparent lie.

771
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,710
Speaker 8:  Like I think it's an obvious lie, but I also am not, I'm

772
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,910
Speaker 8:  not a member of the fan club.

773
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,270
Speaker 5:  Well, so this is all happening in the context of a number of things. So

774
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,950
Speaker 5:  as Liz pointed out, the stock market overall is down ever since he launched

775
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:31,850
Speaker 5:  the Twitter bid, Tesla stock is coming down, both because of the

776
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:35,720
Speaker 5:  market and because a huge part of his financing is tied to Tesla

777
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,470
Speaker 5:  stock. He's out there in the world trying to find other

778
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,790
Speaker 5:  people to finance the bid with him. Maybe he'll be successful. Maybe he

779
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,540
Speaker 5:  won't. I, if I had that amount of money, I wouldn't be like,

780
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,450
Speaker 5:  yeah, Twitter. That's where I'm going to get my return on investment. But

781
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,140
Speaker 5:  who knows?

782
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,280
Speaker 4:  In fact, a lot of very rich companies have made that particular

783
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,440
Speaker 4:  decision in the past not to buy Twitter.

784
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,940
Speaker 5:  It's true. Like, I don't know Bob. I was like, I don't know, like

785
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,360
Speaker 5:  we're not doing that. Like I think apple kicked the tires, Salesforce kick

786
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,570
Speaker 5:  the tires and Salesforce will buy anything. Seriously,

787
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,910
Speaker 5:  Let's check the fine. But it just seems like

788
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,000
Speaker 5:  that's, you know, I buy a lot of dumb stuff. And if you have that much money,

789
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,810
Speaker 5:  like a piece of Twitter might be how I think about one more

790
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,260
Speaker 5:  PS, five game that I'm not gonna play. You know? Like, I don't know that

791
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,680
Speaker 5:  much money, but you can, you can see how the thought process would scale.

792
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,940
Speaker 5:  But it's a lot of money that is depressing. His Tesla stock, as he

793
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,930
Speaker 5:  continues to basically take the freshmen core

794
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,620
Speaker 5:  curriculum of a liberal arts college on Twitter five in

795
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:43,550
Speaker 5:  person, which is like, it's just a thing he's doing, right? He,

796
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,690
Speaker 5:  he tweets some like asinine thing about what if there was a

797
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:51,200
Speaker 5:  more moderate party in the United States and literally Dan Drezner, this

798
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,040
Speaker 5:  is happening right now. Dan dresser, who was my political science

799
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,030
Speaker 5:  professor college. He says, I beg you to add a political

800
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,890
Speaker 5:  science expert to your tutors.

801
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,410
Speaker 8:  Let's see Jeff Bezos. If you were better at Twitter, this could be you.

802
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:06,770
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

803
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,300
Speaker 5:  It's like crazy. He's driving everybody insane. Every one of his

804
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,110
Speaker 5:  content moderation ideas, as I've said, his baby tweets for babies

805
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,250
Speaker 5:  Corrine wrote a great piece this week. Obviously there's an extraordinarily

806
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,270
Speaker 5:  tragic shooting in Buffalo on the big platform

807
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,900
Speaker 5:  side. Casey made this point in his newsletter. The big

808
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,920
Speaker 5:  platforms did like perfect content moderation of

809
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,770
Speaker 5:  the stream. Twitch had it down in two minutes. Facebook had

810
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,340
Speaker 5:  its sort of usual Facebook stumbles because it is

811
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,210
Speaker 5:  huge, but it started clamping it down. Right? I identify it. Twitter clients.

812
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,870
Speaker 5:  It like, it was a little platforms like streamable where

813
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,080
Speaker 5:  things got out of hand and they cause they don't have the resources that

814
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,680
Speaker 5:  are the, the teams or the scale. That's where it went. So the big

815
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:56,280
Speaker 5:  platforms, if you think about it, there was a bad guy. He livestreamed

816
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:00,360
Speaker 5:  the shooting, his horrific racist motivated shooting. He said he was going

817
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,870
Speaker 5:  to do it on discord. All of the stuff. When the platforms saw it within

818
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:07,800
Speaker 5:  minutes, they took action, which is a really hard thing to do. Twitter is

819
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,640
Speaker 5:  obviously doing it to Elan. Hasn't said a word about this, right? If Elan's

820
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,050
Speaker 5:  Elan's conception of what the content moderation standards

821
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,770
Speaker 5:  on Twitter are or should be, is all legal

822
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:23,430
Speaker 5:  speech. Then your first test case is the

823
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,360
Speaker 5:  video of the shooting, right? You've said, if people want

824
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,120
Speaker 5:  more tight content restrictions, they should pass a law. Otherwise I'm doing

825
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,110
Speaker 5:  the first amendment problematic for any number of reasons. This, this is

826
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,080
Speaker 5:  like core classes, education, but this video is legal

827
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,950
Speaker 5:  speech, right? It doesn't meet any of the exceptions.

828
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,850
Speaker 5:  It's just more Allotey. And like honestly, as an ad supported

829
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,600
Speaker 5:  business, like being a place where advertisers want to put their ads, leads

830
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,170
Speaker 5:  you to blocking this video immediately. Yep. This is just one of those spots

831
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,470
Speaker 5:  where like you have to be okay with it because you're okay with the first

832
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,310
Speaker 5:  amendment or you're saying, no, we have to take it down. In which case you

833
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,270
Speaker 5:  have left your principles behind. And

834
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,430
Speaker 5:  now you're saying we're going to make judgment calls.

835
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,420
Speaker 3:  That's why he's talking so much, right? Like, like that's why we're seeing

836
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,170
Speaker 3:  so many stupid inane tweets from him this week is

837
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,890
Speaker 3:  because like he's distracting us. Like, there's a very real

838
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,730
Speaker 3:  question everybody has for him is you want to buy Twitter. You want to

839
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,840
Speaker 3:  change how it moderates here is your first test case and he

840
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,560
Speaker 3:  is pointedly ignoring it. So by

841
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,290
Speaker 3:  like being like, I'm going to drop a poo emoji, I'm going to declare I'm

842
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,440
Speaker 3:  a Republican, which is a shock to absolutely no one. Like,

843
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,030
Speaker 5:  Did he move to Texas?

844
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,570
Speaker 3:  Like, come on. Like, you don't have that much money and not be, but whatever.

845
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:43,530
Speaker 3:  Like he's just doing all of this stuff to distract us from the fact

846
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,380
Speaker 3:  that he had this test case and he blew it,

847
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,480
Speaker 5:  Blow it. He just didn't say anything.

848
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,720
Speaker 3:  He didn't say anything because what he would have said, like if, if he held

849
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,620
Speaker 3:  his, his principles, quote, unquote of being like the first amendment

850
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,230
Speaker 3:  guy, the first amendment would require it to stay up.

851
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,410
Speaker 8:  I want to be clear. He said a number of things, but not actually about the

852
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,340
Speaker 8:  shooting, because he did talk about like content moderation again. And like

853
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:09,720
Speaker 8:  this time he was like, oh, you don't want to be manipulated by the algorithm.

854
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,410
Speaker 8:  You should get chronological feeds instead. And then he had

855
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,160
Speaker 8:  time for Matt Taibbi. So congratulations to Matt on that

856
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,730
Speaker 8:  about corporate regulation in California, there were images of a space X

857
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,720
Speaker 8:  launch. There was a Royal portrait of a king Louis, the

858
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,380
Speaker 8:  14th of France. And then he, the next day

859
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,420
Speaker 8:  decided it would be cool to talk a little bit more about the important of

860
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,260
Speaker 8:  open source code. So it's just, it's, it's a

861
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,220
Speaker 8:  lot of stuff to say, nothing that you could

862
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,270
Speaker 8:  engage with if you want, I guess, although I don't think anybody

863
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:46,630
Speaker 8:  here needs to have chronological tweets on Twitter, explain to them

864
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,990
Speaker 5:  If he's yours has existed for years, by the way you just push that button,

865
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,980
Speaker 8:  You know, it, it does feel disingenuous when you've come out as

866
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,400
Speaker 8:  like a free speech advocate, you have this very public test

867
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,550
Speaker 8:  case. And what you're tweeting about

868
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,420
Speaker 8:  is the algorithm. Like I would understand

869
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,720
Speaker 8:  this. If the algorithm you were tweeting about was the one that helps you

870
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,140
Speaker 8:  locate and take down this kind of content

871
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,320
Speaker 8:  maybe, but that's not what was going on.

872
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,370
Speaker 5:  There's a parallel here. And I feel all, all four of us have pride on our

873
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:22,060
Speaker 5:  best to avoid this. But like tic talking to you too, you are being

874
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,240
Speaker 5:  taken over by the Amber, heard Johnny Depp trial. Right.

875
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,560
Speaker 5:  And that I would, I would just call that like, this is

876
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,790
Speaker 5:  the algorithm sees demand. There's a lot of demand for it. And then

877
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,360
Speaker 5:  like the underlying materials and public domain, because it is just state

878
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,990
Speaker 5:  media, like the government is streaming the trial, so anyone can use it.

879
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,160
Speaker 5:  I mean, it's content creators can use it. So like there's, they're filling

880
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,580
Speaker 5:  this gaping amount of demand for this trial and all kinds of bad things are

881
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,450
Speaker 5:  happening. Like I think last feed had a great headline

882
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,820
Speaker 5:  today or yesterday that was like, I can't wait to watch the movie about how

883
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,490
Speaker 5:  we were all wrong about Amber heard. Yeah. Right. Like it's a spider,

884
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:02,290
Speaker 5:  like that's the bad algorithm like at play. Like you can see it happening

885
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:06,040
Speaker 5:  in real time. Like there's demand for this. People are filling it

886
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,820
Speaker 5:  because they will chase the, the YouTube algorithm or the Tech-Talk algorithm.

887
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,390
Speaker 5:  They actually have no idea what they're talking about people are watching

888
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:17,050
Speaker 5:  all of it. The algorithm sees even more demand. The cycle continues. There

889
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,590
Speaker 5:  is cat 10 barge at NBC news to the great piece about

890
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,270
Speaker 5:  an Elden ring video game streamer, who is pivoted to

891
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:29,140
Speaker 5:  Johnny Depp. Amber heard trial coverage, and his goal is it's

892
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,590
Speaker 5:  building his views. And he's like, when it's over, I'm going to pivot back

893
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:33,310
Speaker 5:  to Elgin and ring.

894
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,280
Speaker 4:  This is how you get in the partner program. That's what he was saying. He

895
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,160
Speaker 4:  was like, this is how I get enough views to get in. And then I can go back

896
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,730
Speaker 5:  And then I can go back. And now my video game content, we monetize. It's

897
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,200
Speaker 5:  like, that's just ice cold. Like that's the most cynical thing I've ever

898
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,040
Speaker 5:  heard. And if Elan's criticism of the algorithm was pointed at that,

899
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,400
Speaker 5:  it would make sense his Chris or the algorithm like Twitter is manipulating

900
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,370
Speaker 5:  you into only seeing the far left stuff that Twitter employees want you to

901
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:58,210
Speaker 5:  see at the same time that there is a

902
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,420
Speaker 5:  hard right. Racially motivated

903
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,410
Speaker 5:  shooting in our country, like in the state that I live at. And

904
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,770
Speaker 5:  like, I, that to me is it's not that we need Ilan to

905
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,640
Speaker 5:  talk about every mass shooting in the country or weigh in on every public

906
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,420
Speaker 5:  event. It's literally the thing that he wants to do would

907
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,420
Speaker 5:  materially change how Twitter responds to these events.

908
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,890
Speaker 5:  Right? And so like understanding of what he would do in this moment is actually

909
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,740
Speaker 5:  really crucial to understanding how serious his

910
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,730
Speaker 5:  free speech philosophy is. And I don't think that he wants to explain

911
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,270
Speaker 5:  that to anyone.

912
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,170
Speaker 8:  I feel like we already understand how serious this free speech philosophy

913
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,250
Speaker 8:  is. Am I wrong?

914
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,480
Speaker 5:  I dunno. You know, it's, it's so it's chaos. And I think

915
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,690
Speaker 5:  the character of Ilan is word chaotic than the person, the Vilan

916
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,220
Speaker 5:  right. That appears

917
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,390
Speaker 3:  Dude was fairly smart. Like how he set up this deal to begin

918
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:54,380
Speaker 3:  with a lot of the, the, the, the original machinations of this Twitter deal.

919
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,130
Speaker 3:  You're like, okay. I mean, however, I feel about you. This was like,

920
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,450
Speaker 3:  kind of cool and smart, and, and now it's spitting out because

921
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,200
Speaker 3:  he like his funding situation. He's like, we've

922
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,440
Speaker 3:  now had this horrible event happened that it's very pointedly pointed out.

923
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:13,460
Speaker 3:  I massive flaw in his philosophy for moderation. All of this stuff is

924
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:16,730
Speaker 3:  happening. And he's just like, I know what I'm going to do. Erect a billion

925
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,720
Speaker 3:  Straumann to distract you from all the things we actually need to be

926
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,070
Speaker 3:  talking about with this deal.

927
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,470
Speaker 4:  Well, and I think part of the reason, the second after me so much is that

928
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:27,680
Speaker 4:  there's like, the thing I have always struggled with is like the difference

929
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,490
Speaker 4:  between Elon Musk, like the person and at Elon Musk, the

930
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:35,300
Speaker 4:  Twitter personality, right? And at Elon Musk is just like a low stakes

931
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:39,020
Speaker 4:  shit poster. But like he doesn't, he mostly doesn't engage on

932
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,680
Speaker 4:  things that actually matter, except to just like, sort of talk shit in all

933
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,670
Speaker 4:  directions and, and like giggle as everyone freaks out. This is one

934
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,270
Speaker 4:  of those things that a is very high stakes B

935
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:54,320
Speaker 4:  matters to Elon Musk, the person who is theoretically gonna own Twitter and

936
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,470
Speaker 4:  will at some point and have to make a decision like this and see is going

937
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:01,250
Speaker 4:  to make an enormous number of people, incredibly angry, no matter what you

938
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:05,120
Speaker 4:  pick. And he does not actually tend to engage on

939
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:09,020
Speaker 4:  that kind of stuff directly all that often. But in this case, if he buys

940
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,260
Speaker 4:  Twitter, he's going to have to that's the, and that's why I feel like the

941
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,190
Speaker 4:  silence from him was so strong where it's like, I don't generally

942
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:20,000
Speaker 4:  care what CEOs have to say after events

943
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,760
Speaker 4:  like this. Right? Like I don't, I don't know that it helps anybody to like,

944
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,820
Speaker 4:  get thoughts and prayers from bill gates after the shooting in Buffalo. I

945
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,340
Speaker 4:  don't know if he did that. I'm not picking up bill gates specifically, but

946
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:32,060
Speaker 4:  in this case, it's like at some point someone is going to walk into a room

947
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,020
Speaker 4:  and say, Elon, what do we do? And he's going to have to decide,

948
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,590
Speaker 4:  and like, God help us. If he is like the person he is on Twitter.

949
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,790
Speaker 4:  But I think at some point you would want to see that actual person be

950
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,120
Speaker 4:  on Twitter rather than just whoever this character is. And it feels like

951
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,070
Speaker 4:  we're, we still haven't gotten any of that.

952
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,460
Speaker 8:  The other thing that I would just add to this is that like adding to that

953
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,450
Speaker 8:  specific kind of pressure is that it's very like at the front

954
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:59,960
Speaker 8:  of my mind that like moderation on YouTube at one point led to a mass shooting.

955
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,340
Speaker 8:  Like that's a real thing that really happened. And so like, this is

956
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:07,910
Speaker 8:  actually a very, very fraught area that

957
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:11,360
Speaker 8:  like, I don't know that Elon Musk

958
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:14,990
Speaker 8:  can weigh in on without making

959
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,290
Speaker 8:  things considerably worse.

960
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:22,040
Speaker 8:  Because again, like th think about who his followers

961
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,740
Speaker 8:  are. If he decides to criticize Twitter, taking down

962
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,640
Speaker 8:  links to this shooting, that seems gross and wrong, and a bunch

963
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,570
Speaker 8:  of people are going to be mad. But if he

964
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:37,500
Speaker 8:  says, Hey, I've reconsidered. You know, my thoughts about free

965
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,070
Speaker 8:  speech I've, I've got a more nuanced plan. Now that

966
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,430
Speaker 8:  potentially freaks out everybody who wanted to bring back Donald Trump to

967
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:48,180
Speaker 8:  the platform. And also like potentially like not for nothing

968
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,570
Speaker 8:  puts Twitter employees at actual physical risk.

969
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:56,010
Speaker 8:  So I just feel like it's a super ugly place to be. And like it's

970
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,940
Speaker 8:  when we talk about how difficult it is to moderate these platforms,

971
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,330
Speaker 8:  this is specifically the thing that we're talking about. And, you know, there

972
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:07,170
Speaker 8:  was that thread from the former Reddit CEO about how he was like

973
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,840
Speaker 8:  Eli, and you don't want this, like, this is going to break you. This is going

974
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,630
Speaker 8:  to be the worst thing you've ever you've ever seen. Like this was what he

975
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:13,080
Speaker 8:  meant.

976
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,280
Speaker 5:  The thing I'll add is this is like inside baseball, journalism.

977
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:21,270
Speaker 5:  But I think it's useful context here. We're good at this story

978
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:24,600
Speaker 5:  now, like the verge is good at it. And like, kind of the broader media is

979
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,480
Speaker 5:  good at it. Like the thing happens where, like, what are the platforms going

980
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,140
Speaker 5:  to do? We reach out to Tom's team at the platforms we hear

981
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,830
Speaker 5:  from the head of policy. We hear from the head of trust and

982
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,890
Speaker 5:  safety. They've made a decision. The decision has been like

983
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,850
Speaker 5:  reasonably disseminated to their teams. They tell us the

984
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,490
Speaker 5:  timeline on which they made the decision. This is how we know Twitch did

985
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:48,000
Speaker 5:  it in minutes. Like in one very abstract way. It's like an exchange of form

986
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,820
Speaker 5:  letters, right? We're like, what did you do? And here's what we did. And

987
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,000
Speaker 5:  it all, it all makes sense. And we've like, we've learned how to

988
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,240
Speaker 5:  communicate about content moderation between

989
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,600
Speaker 5:  professionals at like a pretty high level. And like that requires a comms

990
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,590
Speaker 5:  apparatus and a policy apparatus and a trust and safety team. And

991
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:08,160
Speaker 5:  then maybe they got it wrong. Maybe they didn't. But like whatever, we know

992
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,610
Speaker 5:  how to have the communication yuans companies don't have press

993
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,630
Speaker 5:  departments. They don't have comms. They don't like communicating about

994
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:19,440
Speaker 5:  what they're doing. He literally opened this by starting

995
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,070
Speaker 5:  online harassment campaign against Twitter's top lawyer, vagina. Got it.

996
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:27,060
Speaker 5:  Like just crazy. Like, it's like, it's not going to work if he takes over.

997
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,660
Speaker 5:  And he doesn't have that functionality because if you're running the town

998
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,320
Speaker 5:  square, the town square has to be accountable to people. And so

999
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,950
Speaker 5:  we should wrap this up, but like one of the funniest parts about this whole

1000
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,760
Speaker 5:  week is that Twitter had an all hands this week and they

1001
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:45,300
Speaker 5:  told staff that there's no such thing as a deal being on hold

1002
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,290
Speaker 5:  Twitter, saying they want the deal to be completed on the agreed upon terms,

1003
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:52,740
Speaker 5:  which by the way, they have a binding contract along rode to

1004
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:56,910
Speaker 5:  Elan and said buying Twitter, which is like a crazy outcome. But the,

1005
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,720
Speaker 5:  you know, Twitter's head lawyer who would make those decisions and do those

1006
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,350
Speaker 5:  things are it's a good try. I got a, who is in charge of content policy.

1007
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,680
Speaker 5:  So now he pissed off the lawyer, which is just one of those like classic

1008
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,310
Speaker 5:  errors,

1009
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:11,100
Speaker 5:  Like

1010
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,940
Speaker 3:  How much of this Twitter deal is just Elan Musk,

1011
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,150
Speaker 3:  his ego, getting away from it. Like how much of this is just hubris. We're

1012
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,130
Speaker 3:  just watching like hubris happen.

1013
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,130
Speaker 8:  I would say at least 95%.

1014
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,820
Speaker 4:  I was going to say a little lower, but I think you're probably right. Yeah.

1015
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,420
Speaker 4:  I mean, it does seem like he thinks he can just chaos his way

1016
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,350
Speaker 4:  into whatever he wants. And Twitter holds all the

1017
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,370
Speaker 4:  actual cards here.

1018
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,420
Speaker 8:  I will say that like one thing that I've been reflecting on for a while

1019
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:44,170
Speaker 8:  now is that the reason why Elon Musk thinks he can do this is

1020
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,950
Speaker 8:  because he's chaos his way into a lot of things. And out of a lot of

1021
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,820
Speaker 8:  things, just without consequences or with

1022
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,540
Speaker 8:  consequences that are so minimal for him, like for

1023
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,810
Speaker 8:  instance, a $20 million fine from the sec

1024
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:03,220
Speaker 8:  that, you know, it's a slap on the wrist. And so on some

1025
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,520
Speaker 8:  level, I think he genuinely believes the laws of the

1026
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,480
Speaker 8:  United States of America don't apply to him. And I am very interested

1027
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,140
Speaker 8:  in finding out if he's right, because if that's true,

1028
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,550
Speaker 8:  we have a problem.

1029
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,530
Speaker 5:  We need to end the segment before our producer, Liam like literally jumps

1030
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:23,410
Speaker 5:  through the zoom and chokes me out. He's been writing in all caps in red,

1031
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:26,140
Speaker 5:  we're over in the dock. This is a real thing. That's happening.

1032
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,270
Speaker 5:  The one thing I'll say two decisions out of the fifth circuit, which represents

1033
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:35,260
Speaker 5:  taxes this week. One, they let the horrible Texas social

1034
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,360
Speaker 5:  media bill go through, which is not being appeal to the Supreme court,

1035
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,980
Speaker 5:  hilarious backstory to that. They weren't expecting to win that.

1036
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:45,100
Speaker 5:  And now they have to find lawyers to argue their case in the Supreme court.

1037
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,000
Speaker 5:  And they can't find any lawyers you want to. It's very funny. And then to

1038
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,930
Speaker 5:  fifth circuit, same crazy ass, fifth circuit. You want to see some wild.

1039
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,190
Speaker 5:  You want to see judges losing their minds. Fifth circuit. They reversed

1040
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:00,790
Speaker 5:  an sec enforcement order this week saying that

1041
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:04,480
Speaker 5:  administrative, the administrative state was not appropriate in this case,

1042
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,650
Speaker 5:  which has a real, your Elan and your federal appellate

1043
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:12,600
Speaker 5:  court is saying the sec, can't do stuff to you. Ooh. Ooh.

1044
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,120
Speaker 5:  All right. We got to take a break, Liz. I'm sure we will have you back on

1045
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,630
Speaker 5:  for this week in the Elan for many weeks to come. This is like the story

1046
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,600
Speaker 5:  of the year. It's very entertaining for a variety of reasons.

1047
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,800
Speaker 5:  Also. I think it might end with Twitter being gone no matter what

1048
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,760
Speaker 5:  happens. That's my current prediction is that no matter what happens

1049
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,720
Speaker 5:  at the end of this Twitter has gone. Like they might like Jack Dorsey might

1050
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,660
Speaker 5:  be like, delete it. I'll do it on the blockchain. Like you never know. Like,

1051
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,980
Speaker 5:  we'll see. All right. Thank you so much, Liz. Right?

1052
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:42,520

1091
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,360
Speaker 5:  All right. We're back this gadget news sound for a gadget lightning

1092
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:15,050
Speaker 5:  round we're opening and closing the show. It's an Ilan sandwich with

1093
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:15,620
Speaker 5:  gadgets.

1094
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,460
Speaker 3:  Yes.

1095
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,370
Speaker 5:  David has been thinking about like, you know, what are the, what are the

1096
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:22,730
Speaker 5:  default structures of the Vergecast as we read, you know, refresh the show,

1097
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,990
Speaker 5:  Ilan sandwich with gadgets, we should start naming them and putting on

1098
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:28,520
Speaker 5:  the, on the wall, like a deli.

1099
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:33,320
Speaker 4:  That's actually like if you were to perfectly describe every episode ever

1100
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,500
Speaker 4:  done of the Vergecast and Ilan Sanders with gadgets is like, as bout, as

1101
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:36,890
Speaker 4:  close as

1102
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:42,620
Speaker 5:  All right. I will tell you I'm looking at the rundown and the in parentheses,

1103
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:46,100
Speaker 5:  it just says, we're just going to let Kranz be excited for like 20 minutes

1104
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,350
Speaker 5:  here. Let's go ahead, Alex.

1105
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:52,580
Speaker 3:  I don't know if I can do 20 minutes. I could probably do 45. This

1106
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:56,240
Speaker 3:  is going to be heavily edited for you listeners at home.

1107
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,140
Speaker 3:  So apple is reportedly testing, a

1108
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:04,040
Speaker 3:  foldable phone that has as a secondary display,

1109
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:06,920
Speaker 3:  the outside display, an E ink display.

1110
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,820
Speaker 5:  Oh boy.

1111
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,790
Speaker 3:  I mean, it's, it's Minky quo who

1112
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,680
Speaker 3:  we've talked about a lot on the show, usually really good at like picking

1113
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,860
Speaker 3:  out what Apple's working on. What's probably coming

1114
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,160
Speaker 3:  usually kind of considered to be spot on. I refuse to

1115
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,090
Speaker 3:  believe they're spot on in this case, as much as I want them to be as

1116
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:30,960
Speaker 3:  much as I want an E ink iPhone. I just don't

1117
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,250
Speaker 3:  see how it happens.

1118
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,760
Speaker 4:  Well, so, okay. We, we should say like, this is one of those things that

1119
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,790
Speaker 4:  like, the longer you cover this stuff, the more you come to it as like the

1120
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,480
Speaker 4:  word testing is very important here, right? Because like apple is testing

1121
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,900
Speaker 4:  everything, right? Someone at apple has bought

1122
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,590
Speaker 4:  everything that exists. That is an electronic on planet earth and

1123
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:52,980
Speaker 4:  has tried to build something with it, like it just has happened. And so I

1124
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,310
Speaker 4:  think the part of what's interesting about leaks like these is they tend

1125
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,130
Speaker 4:  to come from the supply chain, which likely means someone has bought, you

1126
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:02,490
Speaker 4:  know, more than three of them. But the idea that apple is testing a foldable

1127
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,150
Speaker 4:  with needing to display makes me very excited. Also means

1128
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:10,440
Speaker 4:  almost nothing about actual Apple's actual like future plans. This is

1129
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,070
Speaker 4:  the device that I want in my life more than maybe anything else in the entire

1130
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:17,820
Speaker 4:  world, but there is absolutely no indication that it's real.

1131
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:21,810
Speaker 4:  Other than that, like somewhere in the giant spaceship in

1132
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:25,680
Speaker 4:  Cupertino, someone is like standing at a desk, goofing around

1133
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,540
Speaker 4:  with an ink screen on a foldable display

1134
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,590
Speaker 3:  Enough eating screens that it got back to quote, to talk,

1135
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:36,090
Speaker 3:  be like, this is happening. This is being tested. And

1136
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,810
Speaker 3:  like, we don't know what kind of, as we've discussed in the past, there are

1137
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,640
Speaker 3:  multiple types of E ink, electronic paper E

1138
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,580
Speaker 3:  ink is the company. They get very testy. If you use E ink to

1139
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,910
Speaker 3:  describe all electronic paper, electronic paper is the actual

1140
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:54,810
Speaker 3:  display technology. There's a whole bunch out there. It was very excited

1141
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:58,440
Speaker 3:  a couple of weeks ago because there's a new, like rollable color one. And

1142
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,890
Speaker 3:  like, it just, didn't no way maybe, oh no, there's a

1143
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:05,760
Speaker 3:  5% possibility. I can see a 5% possibility of this

1144
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,600
Speaker 3:  phone existing in the world. Right. Because 95% of me says, apple will

1145
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,350
Speaker 3:  never go with this display technology that feels really immature.

1146
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:16,050
Speaker 3:  They typically go with very mature technologies or

1147
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,990
Speaker 5:  They like apple watch it. And they're like, what if we just didn't have a

1148
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,730
Speaker 5:  display for most of the time?

1149
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:25,050
Speaker 3:  Right. And that's the 5% I'm like, okay. If they put like a, they get a

1150
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:28,800
Speaker 3:  really good artists to do a really good eating wallpaper

1151
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:32,700
Speaker 3:  and they're just using it for like notifications and the

1152
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,790
Speaker 3:  clock. And it will look really, really pretty. There'll be like, look at

1153
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,630
Speaker 3:  our artsy fartsy E ink display.

1154
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,710
Speaker 3:  I could see that

1155
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:44,760
Speaker 5:  I've been thinking about this in the context of the Google AR losses concept,

1156
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,870
Speaker 5:  where they like got closer to a useful product by making it do far

1157
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:49,380
Speaker 5:  less.

1158
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:49,890
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1159
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,740
Speaker 5:  Even though it's just a concept, you know, whatever, we'll see if they ever

1160
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:56,430
Speaker 5:  ship anything. But right now what the default three has a big eating,

1161
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:00,180
Speaker 5:  a big old screen on the front. There's other foldables that have big

1162
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:04,140
Speaker 5:  old screens on the front. And so basically you get, like, if you look at

1163
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,530
Speaker 5:  that screen and you know, it's running Android, and then like, your

1164
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:11,400
Speaker 5:  expectation is like, now I have a tiny phone. Like

1165
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:15,210
Speaker 5:  what if instead of unfolding my phone to use it, I just use the

1166
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:19,150
Speaker 5:  tiny shit version of my phone. Right. And it's like, I

1167
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,690
Speaker 5:  kind of understand it, but you can see why you'd say, well, we'll just change

1168
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,530
Speaker 5:  that expectation by new Ian, we'll save the power. We'll let it do

1169
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:29,050
Speaker 5:  what a time. Maybe

1170
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,460
Speaker 5:  notification of like calls or like number of I

1171
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,610
Speaker 5:  messages, but to actually use the phone you got to unfolded.

1172
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,060
Speaker 4:  Yeah. To me, I think the, the, the, what the apple watch looks like on your

1173
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:43,750
Speaker 4:  nightstand is an interesting analog there. Cause it's become like a

1174
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:47,650
Speaker 4:  really useful use case for the watch that it's like, it's also kind of

1175
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:51,430
Speaker 4:  your bedside clock and it'll show you like just teeny tiny bits of

1176
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,880
Speaker 4:  information. And I feel like that kind of thing where you can have this thing

1177
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,660
Speaker 4:  that is always on and uses almost no power, but can tell you like sort of

1178
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,900
Speaker 4:  the bare minimum that you need to know, especially if apple is invested in

1179
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,990
Speaker 4:  the idea of not making you look at your phone a thousand times a day, giving

1180
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:08,650
Speaker 4:  you more proactive information, all this stuff. Like that's where a

1181
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:12,130
Speaker 4:  very basic thing that doesn't require you to open, or even

1182
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,490
Speaker 4:  necessarily like touch your phone gets super interesting to me.

1183
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,420
Speaker 5:  What was that thing that chumby I think ruled,

1184
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:23,140
Speaker 5:  it was like a little, it was like a little soft guy with like a

1185
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:24,520
Speaker 4:  Fluffy alarm clock. Yeah.

1186
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,650
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And you could like do Linux apps.

1187
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:31,630
Speaker 5:  It's a future. The iPhone is really, the front is a Trumpy. I,

1188
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,240
Speaker 5:  as apple bought chumby is

1189
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:40,240
Speaker 5:  let's swing. She will have to say about apple bank. Chompy mark

1190
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,080
Speaker 5:  Gurman. Where are you at? Get on the chumby story. I just see, I can see

1191
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,560
Speaker 5:  them cutting it down. I'm with David, like you reduce the

1192
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,470
Speaker 5:  expectations of what that front display can do by using a different display

1193
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:54,310
Speaker 5:  technology. Maybe you get some battery life back. Cause like the little dumb

1194
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:57,430
Speaker 5:  Android phone on the front of a Z flip is just like fully ridiculous

1195
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,090
Speaker 4:  Ad. Yeah.

1196
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,720
Speaker 5:  You don't need that. Anyway. Apple is announced. They're gonna bring live

1197
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,690
Speaker 5:  captions, see iPhone, iPad, and Mac daddy, some gesture control of the apple

1198
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:08,650
Speaker 5:  watch. I saw a bunch of people read. This is, this is a live

1199
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:12,520
Speaker 5:  captions in particular like a step towards AR. Right? Cause then you

1200
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:16,420
Speaker 5:  can like, you can like listen to immediately understand text. It'll be like

1201
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:16,960
Speaker 5:  the Google glass.

1202
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,100
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, in an interesting way, a lot of Apple's accessibility features

1203
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,100
Speaker 4:  have been kind of leading indicators for some of that stuff. Like it was

1204
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:28,090
Speaker 4:  doing really high end screen reader and

1205
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:32,050
Speaker 4:  voice stuff with as an accessibility feature before it brought it more broadly,

1206
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:36,070
Speaker 4:  it's been doing the, the like gesture control that you can get on the watch

1207
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,980
Speaker 4:  is an accessibility feature that also like you don't have to squint that

1208
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:42,940
Speaker 4:  hard to see it as how you might control something on your phone by like pinching

1209
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:46,870
Speaker 4:  twice to answer or hang up a call. That kind of stuff. Like I think

1210
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:50,830
Speaker 4:  the live captions is probably just a genuinely useful accessibility feature,

1211
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:54,460
Speaker 4:  which I think is obviously I think apple cares a lot about, but like, if

1212
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,610
Speaker 4:  you're going to do AR that you gotta have something like that, that works,

1213
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:57,910
Speaker 4:  right?

1214
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:01,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It seems like the first key thing. Right. You gotta be able to listen

1215
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,750
Speaker 5:  and understand the text so that you can like translate it to other texts

1216
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,710
Speaker 5:  or something. iOS 15.5 came out the new version of

1217
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,220
Speaker 5:  maca west on we're basically just in the run up to WWDC here. Yup.

1218
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:16,430
Speaker 5:  The thing that is important about these updates is the thing that I failed

1219
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:20,390
Speaker 5:  to do, which is the studio display God, it's up to its final

1220
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:23,960
Speaker 5:  update. And Dan's like, are you going to plug it in and change the review?

1221
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,440
Speaker 5:  And I'm like, do I have to? So I

1222
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,130
Speaker 5:  promise that today or tomorrow I'll plug it in. I'll give it the

1223
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:35,030
Speaker 5:  final update. And it's still going to be a six or whatever we gave it. Cause

1224
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:36,290
Speaker 5:  it's, it's still looks bad.

1225
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,380
Speaker 4:  I look forward to you looking very slightly less sunburned.

1226
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,640
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's going to

1227
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:40,850
Speaker 4:  Be okay.

1228
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:45,380
Speaker 5:  Unless they radically changed the crop. I don't, I think it's

1229
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:49,010
Speaker 5:  still going to look bad. A bunch of headphones stuff. Chris Walsh

1230
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:51,410
Speaker 5:  continues to curl around the events,

1231
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:56,480
Speaker 5:  but he got hugely king actually. Congratulations, Chris, he's been leaking

1232
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,870
Speaker 5:  all kinds of sinus stuff. We've got the sub mini, which is a product we've

1233
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:03,560
Speaker 5:  all wanted for a million years because the existing

1234
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,550
Speaker 5:  sub $750, which is too much money

1235
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:10,730
Speaker 5:  to pay for a sub of her does not say how much it's going to

1236
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:14,390
Speaker 5:  cost, but it's going to be cheaper. It looks cool.

1237
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:18,560
Speaker 3:  I hope it sounds as good because the current sub is really nice. Yeah.

1238
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,170
Speaker 3:  It's just not $800. Nice. Yeah.

1239
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:24,950
Speaker 4:  Did either of you also look at this render and think, oh,

1240
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:28,890
Speaker 4:  Sonos bought all of the old Mac pro trash cans and

1241
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:29,990
Speaker 3:  This

1242
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,210
Speaker 5:  That's pretty good. It has a real earliest

1243
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,130
Speaker 5:  2000 Sony vibe to it as well.

1244
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,630
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. I can see that. Yeah. It's like what if we get furniture, but also

1245
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:42,470
Speaker 4:  sound

1246
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:46,610
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that, that does sound like a Sony marketing campaign.

1247
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,550
Speaker 4:  She liked to sit on your Ottoman and play music through your butt.

1248
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,550
Speaker 3:  Very party speaker.

1249
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:55,460
Speaker 5:  Hey, if you want to talk about party speakers and the virtuous, I'm here

1250
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:59,000
Speaker 5:  for it. We can go for another hour. Here's what I want to know. If you work

1251
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,480
Speaker 5:  at Sony or JBL or whatever, and you are in the

1252
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,050
Speaker 5:  Bluetooth party, speaker division, just leak me, your P and

1253
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:09,680
Speaker 5:  L's right. Cause we're on like 14 generations of these

1254
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,250
Speaker 5:  things. And they're, from what I can tell a big

1255
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,790
Speaker 5:  business, like, let me know, what is the budget for

1256
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:20,570
Speaker 5:  LEDs? What is the bill of materials for extremely

1257
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,410
Speaker 5:  garish LEDs parties, speakers in your division. When you

1258
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:27,830
Speaker 5:  have your product meetings, does the PM come up and say, you know, we've,

1259
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:32,150
Speaker 5:  you know, team, we've been looking at the research from the third generation

1260
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:35,750
Speaker 5:  of party speakers, which we just launched. And you know, the data really

1261
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,680
Speaker 5:  tells us that in frat houses around America, we need to add even more cup

1262
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:43,340
Speaker 5:  holders to these speakers. Like let me know.

1263
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:47,330
Speaker 5:  I'm, I've wanted the, the inside story of the party speaker explosion

1264
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,080
Speaker 5:  for many years,

1265
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:52,430
Speaker 4:  We're like four generations away from them just accidentally building a self-driving

1266
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:53,900
Speaker 4:  car around the speaker.

1267
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:58,850
Speaker 5:  Like there's more innovation happening in party speakers and almost any other

1268
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:02,720
Speaker 5:  area in tech. They're great. We've had some amazing ones

1269
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,130
Speaker 5:  like float through the verge office.

1270
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:08,390
Speaker 4:  One more music thing. This is it's not party speaker related, but there's

1271
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:12,350
Speaker 4:  one of the things Chris Welch also reviewed this week. The one

1272
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:16,110
Speaker 4:  plus Nord buds review, which are these like $40

1273
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:19,380
Speaker 4:  wireless earbuds. And I've also been using them for the last week, after

1274
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:23,370
Speaker 4:  like a tour of every cheap pair of wireless earbuds. You can

1275
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:27,210
Speaker 4:  buy because I've lost four pairs of AirPods and just can't justify

1276
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:31,080
Speaker 4:  buying more AirPods. And so he landed basically in the same place that I

1277
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,560
Speaker 4:  did, which is like, it's the, the case is a little big. The

1278
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,650
Speaker 4:  microphone's not amazing, but they're 40 bucks and they pair really fast

1279
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:40,800
Speaker 4:  and they're pretty comfortable and they're, they're pretty good. So my new,

1280
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,460
Speaker 4:  like mega cheap pair of like, I just need some

1281
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,820
Speaker 4:  headphones to wear while I'm walking. The dog is these. So if you're looking

1282
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:51,030
Speaker 4:  for something stupid cheap, that won't hurt when you lose, these are the

1283
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,870
Speaker 4:  ones, how are

1284
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:52,650
Speaker 3:  You losing them?

1285
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:56,430
Speaker 4:  Okay. So I'm convinced my mother-in-law stole one of my pairs. That's let's

1286
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:59,220
Speaker 4:  start there. Okay. Absolutely. A hundred percent convinced she didn't have

1287
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,200
Speaker 4:  AirPods. And then I lost mine and then she had AirPods

1288
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,990
Speaker 4:  just saying there was one pair that I still have, but I got caught in the

1289
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,620
Speaker 4:  rain. And so now the battery lasts like the time it takes to put them on.

1290
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,280
Speaker 4:  And then the die, a third pair I traveled with and I think

1291
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:18,240
Speaker 4:  left in San Francisco. So those I'm never getting back. And then a fourth

1292
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,540
Speaker 4:  pair is just gone. I have no idea. I bought it and all like, like a

1293
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,780
Speaker 4:  shockingly quickly, like a couple of weeks later they were just gone.

1294
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:29,070
Speaker 4:  So I'm just, now I'm at a point it's like AirPods and fancy sunglasses. I'm

1295
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:31,110
Speaker 4:  just not allowed to buy anymore because I will lose them.

1296
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:35,130
Speaker 5:  The Sony link buds S the case looks suspiciously like an AirPods

1297
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:38,640
Speaker 5:  case. So here's how you would know, cause she'd never buy those. So you got

1298
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,580
Speaker 5:  to leave that line around and be like, you

1299
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:45,840
Speaker 5:  really, what you come on the verge test for is ways to trick your mother-in-law.

1300
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,960
Speaker 5:  You got to wear a wire David,

1301
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,860
Speaker 5:  A bunch of these smart home stuff. I will say that one that's most interesting

1302
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:59,760
Speaker 5:  to me, Samsung is going to start testing matter on the smart

1303
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,600
Speaker 5:  things platform it's like in beta. We'll see if it works, but it's the first

1304
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,020
Speaker 5:  big company to do it. And smart things is

1305
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,390
Speaker 5:  real. You know, like a lot of people have it.

1306
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,260
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's the first one to go past the, like, we are launching it soon thing

1307
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,120
Speaker 4:  into like, this is now a thing you can do.

1308
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:16,770
Speaker 3:  And they're actually like good.

1309
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,890
Speaker 5:  And they went from launching a press release to launching a webpage where

1310
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:23,130
Speaker 5:  you can sign up for a partner early access program that will come soon. So

1311
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,450
Speaker 5:  they've gotten to the forums.

1312
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,690
Speaker 4:  It's only coming soon. Okay. That's about where I thought, I thought at least

1313
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,490
Speaker 4:  the partners could already early access.

1314
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:32,940
Speaker 5:  All right. And then we got to end this thing. We, we have to talk about Eric

1315
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:36,870
Speaker 5:  and pebble and the man go ahead, David man wants to smell small Android phone.

1316
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:41,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Okay. So Eric Makowski, who was the founder

1317
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,790
Speaker 4:  of pebble and has since done a number of things. He's currently the CEO of

1318
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:48,780
Speaker 4:  beeper, which is a cool multi messaging app messaging app that I

1319
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:52,650
Speaker 4:  kind of dig like really, really badly, wants to make

1320
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:56,520
Speaker 4:  Google, I guess, make Google make a small Android phone. He wants a small

1321
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,730
Speaker 4:  Android phone to exist, and he seems to want Google to make it, and basically

1322
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:03,360
Speaker 4:  what he seems to want. And by what he seems to want is like, he explicitly

1323
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,350
Speaker 4:  said this many times over and over again, he wants an iPhone mini running

1324
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,500
Speaker 4:  stock, Android. And the theory behind it is like

1325
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,950
Speaker 4:  small phones are good. Not everyone wants to big monster

1326
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:18,850
Speaker 4:  giant phones. And he doesn't necessarily want it to even

1327
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,000
Speaker 4:  be like super, super fancy, just like

1328
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:25,900
Speaker 4:  small, good, useful phone at a reasonable price.

1329
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:30,010
Speaker 4:  And he's trying to get 50,000 signatures. I'm not sure what he's going to

1330
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:33,940
Speaker 4:  do after that. Just like mail it to Sundar

1331
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,900
Speaker 4:  Pichai and see what happens. But that is his quest. And I guess

1332
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:41,110
Speaker 4:  it sounds like according to his website, over 10,000 people have already

1333
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,720
Speaker 4:  signed the petition. So he seems to be well on his way.

1334
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,700
Speaker 3:  Am I allowed to sign it? I'm going to,

1335
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:48,760
Speaker 5:  He can sign it. I will say that Eric, to me, the petition was like, let's

1336
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,220
Speaker 5:  see if we can get Dieter and his new bosses to build this world's

1337
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:56,530
Speaker 5:  Diener. You got your first, Eric was at the screening of springboard that

1338
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:59,290
Speaker 5:  we do at the computer history museum. So we saw him there and we were joking

1339
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:02,680
Speaker 5:  about it, but I, I believe it. I just, here's what I know in my heart. People

1340
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,740
Speaker 5:  say they want this thing. And then they go to the store and then they look

1341
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:09,190
Speaker 5:  around furtively and then they gravitate towards the cheapest, biggest screen

1342
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:12,310
Speaker 5:  they can buy. And they buy that one and they take it home and they open Twitter

1343
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:15,910
Speaker 5:  and they say, why won't anyone make a small phone? And I swear to God, this

1344
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:17,710
Speaker 5:  is like the cycle of life. Yes.

1345
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:22,120
Speaker 3:  And it's because they never actually give us a truly good

1346
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:22,720
Speaker 3:  small,

1347
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,840
Speaker 5:  The iPhone mini is a truly good small phone. What are you talking about?

1348
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,850
Speaker 3:  The battery life sucked for the first,

1349
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,780
Speaker 4:  The phone is small. That's like, that's the thing. Like, do you know what

1350
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:35,350
Speaker 4:  they do when they make the phone bigger? As they put more batteries inside

1351
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:35,530
Speaker 4:  of it?

1352
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:37,990
Speaker 4:  It's a miracle

1353
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,140
Speaker 3:  Wouldn't have to, you wouldn't have to do that though. If it was an E ink

1354
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:44,710
Speaker 3:  display, then you could have small phone and battery for years.

1355
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:44,980
Speaker 5:  Okay.

1356
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,250
Speaker 4:  And bring back the iPod classic people want as an EA

1357
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,200
Speaker 3:  Want Eric called me

1358
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:54,130
Speaker 5:  The pebble was the ink display C

1359
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:55,990
Speaker 3:  C synergy.

1360
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,550
Speaker 5:  We gotta end this year. You to sign the petition. Let's see if we can force

1361
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:01,300
Speaker 5:  her to do something.

1362
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,250
Speaker 5:  I don't know what kind of disclosure you need that to be because someone

1363
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:10,240
Speaker 5:  can tell me what the Dieter disclosure needs to be disclosure. Dieter's

1364
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,110
Speaker 5:  my boy. Like, I don't know what you want me to say. That works. Teachers

1365
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:17,770
Speaker 5:  are co-founder, but not as it, I will say the Dieter and I are.

1366
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:21,310
Speaker 5:  We're learning what we can talk about because we want to be very respectful

1367
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:24,580
Speaker 5:  of the fact that we can't just share a brain anymore. And so

1368
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,270
Speaker 5:  mostly it's me threatening to buy him increasingly

1369
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:32,500
Speaker 5:  hard to use old digital cameras. I bought him an

1370
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:36,370
Speaker 5:  apple quick, take 100. And I was mistaken because I thought that I

1371
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:39,850
Speaker 5:  thought it was a Sony Maverick that shot to floppy disk, which has its own

1372
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:43,810
Speaker 5:  set of challenges. I just want to clear, but no apple actually had licensed

1373
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:47,170
Speaker 5:  it from Kodak and it only works with a special

1374
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:47,830
Speaker 5:  cable.

1375
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:48,550
Speaker 3:  Yes.

1376
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:51,700
Speaker 5:  You have to plug into a power Macintosh

1377
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:56,260
Speaker 5:  software has never updated and it only spits out eight

1378
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,370
Speaker 5:  VGA quality photos and a proprietary image format or

1379
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:02,500
Speaker 5:  32, 3 20 by

1380
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:06,790
Speaker 5:  44. So dinner, just

1381
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:10,640
Speaker 5:  send me a list. He sent me an invoice, all the cables stuck.

1382
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:17,200
Speaker 5:  This is what, this is who we are. Now. I'm going to bind that Maverick and

1383
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:21,140
Speaker 5:  next though, if you're listening, man, this is the second you solve the quick

1384
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,800
Speaker 5:  take 100. He's solving a

1385
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,760
Speaker 5:  camera with a significant number of motors inside of it to

1386
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:32,090
Speaker 5:  operate a floppy disc. It's going to be great.

1387
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:36,530
Speaker 5:  All right. That's the show a wild one. Thanks to

1388
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:40,520
Speaker 5:  Liz. You can tweet at all of us. You know, this, you can tweet at David he's

1389
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,390
Speaker 5:  at Pierce. Alex is Alex H Kranz. Liz is Ms. Lopatto. I am

1390
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:47,900
Speaker 5:  at reckless. There's a bunch of stuff to call it on the site this week. A

1391
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:51,830
Speaker 5:  great story about how fears of electromagnetic radiation

1392
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:55,850
Speaker 5:  have spawned this entire industry of like snake oil, RF

1393
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:59,570
Speaker 5:  protectors. It's a very good, and then Mia did a great story

1394
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:03,350
Speaker 5:  on the content moderation challenges of the Buffalo shooting live

1395
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,860
Speaker 5:  stream. If you listen to that part during our last conversation, you went

1396
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:10,310
Speaker 5:  into more it's it's all in there and you did a great job playing apart. A

1397
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:13,910
Speaker 5:  decoder this week was nebulous, EO, Dave whiskeys. That was

1398
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:15,590
Speaker 5:  actually a great conversation

1399
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:16,220
Speaker 1:  That he

1400
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,480
Speaker 4:  Was great. I really enjoyed that one.

1401
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:21,500
Speaker 5:  Usually creator company conversations where like how they're going to take

1402
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,870
Speaker 5:  over Disney. And this one was like, no, here's just how we're going to get

1403
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:27,700
Speaker 5:  people paid a healthy amount of money so they can live balanced lives. Like

1404
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,640
Speaker 5:  I appreciate it. And then Alex, you got what's the series.

1405
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:35,840
Speaker 3:  It was the last episode of the mini-series. And I spoke with Ben

1406
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,260
Speaker 3:  heck, who was one of the first guys to really like start

1407
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,590
Speaker 3:  modding X-Box 360 controllers to make them more accessible.

1408
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:46,550
Speaker 3:  And I spoke with Bryce Johnson from Microsoft. Who's one of the

1409
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:50,210
Speaker 3:  co-creators of the adaptive controller. And it was very, very cool.

1410
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:51,890
Speaker 4:  It was a good episode and it was wild. And

1411
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:55,430
Speaker 3:  So, yeah, we just talked a lot about like PCB boards and

1412
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:59,240
Speaker 3:  contact points and kind of the challenges of making

1413
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,290
Speaker 3:  controllers accessible.

1414
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:04,580
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Ben heck is a Madison Guy. I've I've had beers and burgers

1415
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:08,420
Speaker 5:  Madison open heck in the past because he is a character. That's what I will

1416
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:12,200
Speaker 5:  say. The purest character you will ever find. Great episode,

1417
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,860
Speaker 5:  listen to that. Other than that, we've gone over as always. So that's it.

1418
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,000
Speaker 5:  That's for chest rock'n'roll.
