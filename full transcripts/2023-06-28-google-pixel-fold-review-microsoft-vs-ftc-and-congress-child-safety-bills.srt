Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of The Console Wars.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,780
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I am sitting here on my back patio

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,860
Speaker 2:  pulling weeds out from between all of the bricks back here.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,020
Speaker 2:  you know, I really admire people who like gardening and I

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,780
Speaker 2:  kind of get why it could be cathartic and good and

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,380
Speaker 2:  whatever, and I guess like, yay for people who have green thumbs. But God,

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,300
Speaker 2:  I hate this. I've tried putting bleach out here. I've tried boiling

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,180
Speaker 2:  water, I've tried baking soda, I've tried all the weed be gone stuff.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,620
Speaker 2:  I just wanna like carpet bomb this patio, so nothing can

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,380
Speaker 2:  ever live back here again. But I understand why that's a bad idea.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,540
Speaker 2:  If you have suggestions though, or tips on how to make this a

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,260
Speaker 2:  less horrible process, I'm desperate. Please. Anyway,

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,060
Speaker 2:  in Happier News, we have a great show for you. Today we're gonna talk about

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,020
Speaker 2:  the FTC versus Microsoft trial and what it means for the future of video

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,860
Speaker 2:  games, plus what we're learning about the PlayStation versus Xbox fight.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,260
Speaker 2:  There's been a lot of really good drama the last few days. Then we're gonna

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,060
Speaker 2:  talk about the latest attempts at passing legislation to protect kids online

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,540
Speaker 2:  and why we haven't really been able to do that in more than two decades.

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,940
Speaker 2:  And after that we'll talk about the Pixel Fold, the Razr Plus, and the folding

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,020
Speaker 2:  flipping future of smartphones. All that's coming in just a sec, but I

22
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,860
Speaker 2:  promised myself I would at least weed this back corner before I get

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,540
Speaker 2:  grumpy and quit. And I'm almost done. This is The Verge guest.

24
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,380
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

Speaker 4:  who know them best.

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,600
Speaker 5:  We didn't believe in setting fires cause that was too dangerous. We were,

36
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,360
Speaker 5:  you know, a kind, a gentler kind of crooks so to speak.

37
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,200
Speaker 4:  So the best plan you had was that you'd LaSow it?

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,080
Speaker 6:  Yes. Never imagined I'd use it for a camel.

39
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,360
Speaker 4:  I'm Phoebe Judge and this is criminal. Did you have to say what

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,280
Speaker 4:  was in the box

41
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,200
Speaker 7:  Phoebe? We told lies,

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,960
Speaker 4:  Listen to criminal every week, wherever you get your podcasts.

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,590
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. I did it back corner's done. Only most

44
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,550
Speaker 2:  of the patio to go. But let's get to it. As of right now, as you're

45
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,510
Speaker 2:  hearing this, we're on day four of a supposedly five day trial between

46
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,340
Speaker 2:  Microsoft and the FTC, which will determine the future of Microsoft's

47
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,060
Speaker 2:  68.7 billion acquisition of Activision

48
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,140
Speaker 2:  Blizzard. Microsoft only has a few weeks left to get this deal done

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,100
Speaker 2:  or renegotiated entirely. The UK has already decided to block the deal

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,220
Speaker 2:  and the last few days at this trial has basically been a

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,180
Speaker 2:  parade of gaming executives dishing about the state of the industry.

52
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,220
Speaker 2:  We've learned a ton from this trial. So we grabbed the verges, Tom Warren

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,660
Speaker 2:  to walk us through it and tell us what's coming next. Hi Tom.

54
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,260
Speaker 8:  Hello.

55
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,140
Speaker 2:  Thank you for taking a break from like the deep, deep chaos of the last several

56
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,180
Speaker 2:  days to do this with us. I know,

57
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,300
Speaker 8:  I, I need a break. I need a beer, an holiday and yeah, just

58
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,700
Speaker 8:  everything.

59
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,540
Speaker 2:  Okay, so this trial is not over, like we said at the top. There's more to

60
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,260
Speaker 2:  come, but let's rewind a little bit because obviously this

61
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,660
Speaker 2:  Microsoft Activision Blizzard thing has been going on for a while. Coming

62
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,380
Speaker 2:  into the trial though I don't wanna start it all the way at the beginning,

63
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,820
Speaker 2:  but I do wanna go back six days ago,

64
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,300
Speaker 8:  Right,

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,220
Speaker 2:  Coming into the trial. What was your sense of sort of the leading theory

66
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,780
Speaker 2:  about what might happen? Obviously this, this deal has been litigated

67
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,140
Speaker 2:  elsewhere, which we should get into. There have been lots of questions. There

68
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,220
Speaker 2:  have been sort of pieces of evidence coming out for a long time. Was there

69
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,180
Speaker 2:  kind of a running theory as to who was more likely to win this

70
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,900
Speaker 2:  case coming in?

71
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,940
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think, I think most people probably assume that the FTC will lose,

72
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,020
Speaker 8:  but then most people assumed that the cma, the Competition Markets

73
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,220
Speaker 8:  authority in the UK would approve the deal and they didn't. so like interesting

74
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,460
Speaker 8:  and I think in this case from following it from January, 2022 when

75
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,940
Speaker 8:  they first announced it to, to now is like anything can happen. It's is the,

76
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,780
Speaker 8:  it is the main thing I've learned anything and everything cause it's such

77
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,420
Speaker 8:  a big acquisition, it's like Michael's biggest acquisition

78
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,580
Speaker 8:  and there's obviously regulators in the US wanna crack down on big

79
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,340
Speaker 8:  tech. So this is like a test case almost for it. And yeah, I,

80
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,420
Speaker 8:  I think the feeling is still that the FTC could potentially lose the

81
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,060
Speaker 8:  case just because it's, it's quite hard to win a preliminary injunction

82
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,700
Speaker 8:  cuz you, you have to prove that there's gonna be immediate harm or

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,020
Speaker 8:  you know that this is gonna cause anti-competitive effects if, if Microsoft

84
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,540
Speaker 8:  goes and closes the deal. The reason it's all kind of come about right now

85
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,420
Speaker 8:  is because Microsoft has a cutoff date of July 18th the, the terms of the

86
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,620
Speaker 8:  deal of Activision. So there's a sense of a bit of rush there

87
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,220
Speaker 8:  and a sense of some behind the scenes sort of Microsoft perhaps

88
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,140
Speaker 8:  saying to the cma, we're gonna close overview and maybe

89
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,020
Speaker 8:  potentially separate the exports business in the UK and the FTC hearing

90
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,740
Speaker 8:  about that in press reports panicking and finding the pre preliminary

91
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,220
Speaker 8:  junction. But I still feel like it's gonna be difficult for them to win it

92
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,540
Speaker 8:  and on on on their sort of merits of what they're trying to argue. And I

93
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,740
Speaker 8:  don't think they're, I think from what we've heard as well, they're not necessarily

94
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,860
Speaker 8:  making a good case. I think they're, some of their arguments are really sound

95
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,020
Speaker 8:  but some of them just aren't. And it's like those ones that aren't are the

96
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,260
Speaker 8:  ones that the judges kind of feels like she's most interested in like Call

97
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,740
Speaker 8:  of Duty and stuff because obviously that's been a a running thing over the

98
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,380
Speaker 8:  past sort of year or so as well.

99
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,860
Speaker 2:  Yeah, so it seems to me, and I want to get into some of the specific things

100
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,700
Speaker 2:  we found, cuz I think this case more than most has been full of like really

101
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,980
Speaker 2:  fascinating sort of small details. But it seems to me that the big

102
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,740
Speaker 2:  story that this trial has turned into, and I guess it's kind of

103
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,100
Speaker 2:  two stories, but it's also sort of one story is basically

104
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,300
Speaker 2:  PlayStation versus Xbox and yeah, on on one level it's about

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,260
Speaker 2:  the competition between those two things and their respective consoles. And

106
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,140
Speaker 2:  then on the other level it's about whether Nintendo is a real

107
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,060
Speaker 2:  competitor to those two as well. So it's kind of w who is

108
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,980
Speaker 2:  winning this fight and then who is winning that larger fight and

109
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,100
Speaker 2:  is that larger fight the same as this fight and this is where it gets messy,

110
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,740
Speaker 2:  but like why did this become PlayStation versus

111
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,660
Speaker 2:  Xbox so quickly and so aggressively.

112
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,780
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean that's obviously emerged sort of with regulatory filings in

113
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,500
Speaker 8:  the UK and some of the EU stuff that we've seen

114
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,460
Speaker 8:  back and forth over the sort of past year as well that Sony's obviously opposed

115
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,900
Speaker 8:  the deal and has been very vocal about that in their filings, which

116
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,500
Speaker 2:  It would Right. Just people keep seeming surprised that Sony would be mad

117
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,140
Speaker 2:  about Microsoft buying Activision, but like of course it is, right? Yeah,

118
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,340
Speaker 8:  You'd assume so, right, but I think so that the day one sort of

119
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,500
Speaker 8:  how it all went down on day one was there was this bond show email from

120
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,580
Speaker 8:  Sony PlayStation chief Jim Ryan who apparently said a few days

121
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,140
Speaker 8:  after the deal was announced by Microsoft that you know, it's not an

122
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,300
Speaker 8:  Xbox exclusivity play and that he doesn't have to worry about Call

123
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,180
Speaker 8:  of Duty being exclusive and that Microsoft's thinking bigger than that. And

124
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,740
Speaker 8:  he basically said that in an email to a former c Sony CEO who he's obviously

125
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,660
Speaker 8:  friends with and has known for years, who's, I think he was his previous

126
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,300
Speaker 8:  boss in, you know, decades ago. But yeah, so he had that sort of

127
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,100
Speaker 8:  impression that Jim Ryan knew all along that it wasn't about Xbox

128
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,060
Speaker 8:  exclusivity and that Sony was never really worried about that all along.

129
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,260
Speaker 8:  So that's kind of where Mikes was coming at it from, Sony's been moaning

130
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,940
Speaker 8:  to regulators, all this sort of stuff. And then on day two actually we'll

131
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,460
Speaker 8:  get back to the rest of day one, but on day two we actually had an exchange,

132
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,060
Speaker 8:  another exchange around that email where it was brought up again and then

133
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,860
Speaker 8:  there was like dates where there was some email back and forth and then

134
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,580
Speaker 8:  basically Microsoft insinuating that Jim Ryan and Sony

135
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,300
Speaker 8:  hadn't complained to regulators until after a specific

136
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,340
Speaker 8:  email in on the August 26th, 2022. Now that date is kind of

137
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,100
Speaker 8:  important because before then we hadn't heard about Sony being

138
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,900
Speaker 8:  against the deal. There's obviously talk and and press and all that sort

139
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,820
Speaker 8:  of stuff, but apparently Phil Spencer, so the export chief sent a list

140
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,300
Speaker 8:  of games that would be available in PlayStation to to Jim Ryan

141
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,060
Speaker 2:  And it was not an impressive list of games.

142
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,460
Speaker 8:  No, yeah, he wasn't, he wasn't impressed with the games cuz one of them was

143
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,100
Speaker 8:  Overwatch, but Overwatch two wasn't on there even though Overwatch two

144
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,220
Speaker 8:  hadn't totally come out at that time, but whatever. But the point was that

145
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,700
Speaker 8:  they didn't include all the games that they would expect to be on there.

146
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,660
Speaker 8:  So that's, that triggered the alarm bells. Just days after that

147
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,540
Speaker 8:  email was sent, Phil Spencer said to The Verge that called G was

148
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,020
Speaker 8:  gonna remain on PlayStation for a few more years. That kicked off another

149
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,100
Speaker 8:  sort of public thing with between them. So obviously the communication had

150
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,940
Speaker 8:  broken down over that 26th of August email and it all went, started

151
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,180
Speaker 8:  going public. And what Mike's are saying is, well, Sony didn't have a problem

152
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,380
Speaker 8:  with this deal. We, we were, we were sort of working out a deal between us

153
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,380
Speaker 8:  for the six months or or more. And then they just went rogue and went to

154
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,860
Speaker 8:  regulators and started complaining and saying, yeah, cool. Review's gonna

155
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,340
Speaker 8:  be exclusive even though they knew all along it wouldn't be and all this.

156
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,420
Speaker 8:  So that's Microsoft's argument. So it has descended into this whole Sony

157
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,540
Speaker 8:  versus Microsoft thing pretty much every day. And then the Nintendo Switch

158
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,540
Speaker 8:  part is kind of interesting also really annoying to hear every day.

159
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,980
Speaker 2:  It just comes like every 10 minutes, somebody keeps bringing up the switch

160
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,340
Speaker 2:  it seems

161
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,700
Speaker 8:  Like. Yeah, swear someone's gonna like just butt in and be like Switch, just

162
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,980
Speaker 8:  shout it from the audience or something one day. But the, the core argument

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,740
Speaker 8:  of that is that basically the FTC is defined the console market as a high

164
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,420
Speaker 8:  performance one between Sony and Microsoft, say Xbox and PlayStation. It

165
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,020
Speaker 8:  excludes the switch in that argument saying that it's a mobile sort of device,

166
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,460
Speaker 8:  you know, a portable game console, which it is. And that it doesn't compete

167
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,100
Speaker 8:  with Xbox and PlayStation, which it does, let's be honest. They, they all

168
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,780
Speaker 8:  compete with each other, it's just a little bit different.

169
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,300
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I feel like that's one of those where they, they've spent all this

170
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,180
Speaker 2:  time sort of very carefully litigating whether it does or doesn't,

171
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,140
Speaker 2:  but I feel like yeah, the much more useful thing would just be like ask a

172
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,060
Speaker 2:  hundred people if they're competitive and I suspect 99 of them at least would

173
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,260
Speaker 2:  say, yeah, of course they're competitive,

174
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,980
Speaker 8:  But all those 99 people also agree they're very different. Sure. Those those

175
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,460
Speaker 8:  consoles. Right. So, and I think that's what they're kind of trying to lean

176
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,500
Speaker 8:  on to say that they don't compete. Sure. And then, then there's some Microsoft

177
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,100
Speaker 8:  internal analysis which where they just compete against PlayStation and it's

178
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,260
Speaker 8:  clear that Microsoft and Sony are sort of goes head to head cuz the switch,

179
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,620
Speaker 8:  the power of the switch is slightly behind anyway for, for the sort of game.

180
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,540
Speaker 8:  So, so that has been a running theme cause you f TOC has been adamant

181
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,300
Speaker 8:  about proving that because it is very key because it, it it, it defines the

182
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,860
Speaker 8:  market and it means whether Microsoft has nearly 50% of the market in the

183
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,620
Speaker 8:  US so they're not talking globally or whether it has, you know, it's in a

184
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,420
Speaker 8:  distant third according to Phil Spencer globally. So it does,

185
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,420
Speaker 8:  it does matter like that, that is a key point and it's why they keep hammering

186
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,340
Speaker 8:  it every single time you, you'll get through an hour of testimonial and then

187
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,220
Speaker 8:  it'll come up, you get through an hour round, then it'll come up like it,

188
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,100
Speaker 8:  there's this constant back and forth throughout this case. I'm sure it'll

189
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,820
Speaker 8:  come up again today cuz Nvidia are there talking about cloud gaming. You

190
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,660
Speaker 8:  got Satya Nadella and Bobby Kotick, so there's definitely gonna

191
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,860
Speaker 8:  be some more stuff about the switch in there. Yeah.

192
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,780
Speaker 2:  But it seems like Microsoft's the, the switch is so useful to Microsoft

193
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,340
Speaker 2:  because it seems like the biggest thing Microsoft is trying to do here is

194
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,820
Speaker 2:  play this like, woe is us, we're so tiny,

195
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,980
Speaker 2:  the Xbox is a miserable failure, everybody hates it. And we're,

196
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,020
Speaker 2:  we're buying this company in order to give ourselves

197
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,900
Speaker 2:  just like a tiny little fighting chance in the gaming

198
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,980
Speaker 2:  wars. And on the one hand there are like numbers that

199
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,740
Speaker 2:  support some of that narrative, but on the other hand, like

200
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,300
Speaker 2:  this is Microsoft, it is one of the largest, most successful companies on

201
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,460
Speaker 2:  earth. Xbox has been around for a long time, they're spending 70 billion,

202
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,340
Speaker 2:  which is not what you do with your like failing tiny little business. Is

203
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,620
Speaker 2:  that argument working at all? Like, do you get any sense that Microsoft is

204
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,220
Speaker 2:  successfully painting itself as like the hapless loser in the gaming industry?

205
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,700
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I I don't think that argument really washes. Does it like it it it

206
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,460
Speaker 8:  does in certain circumstances like sure they are probably third in the console

207
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,980
Speaker 8:  market. Like I think that's, that's clear. They're, they're behind the switch,

208
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,780
Speaker 8:  behind the PlayStation, but they also, like the Xbox business isn't terrible,

209
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,540
Speaker 8:  right? Like, he had Phil Spencer saying, you know, we're distant third,

210
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,940
Speaker 8:  we haven't able to compete with PlayStation. But then a week before that,

211
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,460
Speaker 8:  you know, behind closed door meeting, he's saying the exports

212
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,260
Speaker 8:  revenues now are, are more than they were in the 360 era. And they have all

213
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,820
Speaker 8:  these crazy targets that they're hitting, they're doing going for PC game

214
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,420
Speaker 8:  pass growth. And it's like all the positives that investors want hear.

215
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,060
Speaker 8:  So where is the middle line essentially? Like what, what's the reality

216
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,900
Speaker 8:  of the situation? I I think it's like the exports business is, is healthy,

217
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,220
Speaker 8:  but Microsoft has way bigger targets for it internally. And in

218
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,980
Speaker 8:  that respect it's not competing with, with PlayStation. So what

219
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,660
Speaker 8:  they've been trying to say, like Phil Spencer's obviously tried to target

220
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,140
Speaker 8:  buying zinger. They had some talks with, with them for mobile.

221
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,780
Speaker 8:  They've also looked at Sega as well potentially for mobile and

222
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,500
Speaker 8:  and console. But ultimately they're, they're saying that their strategy came

223
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,220
Speaker 8:  around Activision Blizzard for mobile for like Call of Duty mobile

224
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,700
Speaker 8:  and the sort of Candy Crush games that King makes. So they're, they're trying

225
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,340
Speaker 8:  to center it around that, that's our opportunity going forward. So

226
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,660
Speaker 8:  they're trying to say that it's not really gonna make a big difference in

227
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,620
Speaker 8:  consoles, although it probably will because they're gonna have control of

228
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,500
Speaker 8:  Call of Duty and the FTC argues if they have control of Call

229
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,420
Speaker 8:  of Duty and Sony argues as well that will they, you know,

230
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,260
Speaker 8:  essentially make it worse on the PlayStation or, or make it less, you know,

231
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,540
Speaker 8:  even putting it on Game Pass is gonna make it more appealing for

232
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,820
Speaker 8:  you to switch to exports. Right. I think we can all agree that that's probably

233
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,860
Speaker 8:  a thing that you might think, do I wanna pay 70 bucks or should I get a,

234
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,580
Speaker 8:  like should I get an export? So you have to, as someone who likes Call Duty

235
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,340
Speaker 8:  might start thinking that way and then, and then they've had some economic

236
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,100
Speaker 8:  analysis around that. But nothing, nothing that I would say is you could

237
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,820
Speaker 8:  prove it your way. You, you can use analysis models, financial models,

238
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,420
Speaker 8:  all sorts of stuff to sort of guess stuff, but who knows really what's gonna

239
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,060
Speaker 8:  happen. Right.

240
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,020
Speaker 2:  But the College of Duty piece of this does seem important because I think

241
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,140
Speaker 2:  one of my questions coming into this was why is this

242
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,740
Speaker 2:  specific acquisition the one that's being litigated? And I think this question

243
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,100
Speaker 2:  has come up over and over, right? Because there is this question of we're

244
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,420
Speaker 2:  arguing about game exclusives and, and like everyone on all sides keeps

245
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,300
Speaker 2:  reminding the judge in this case that every company has exclusives, gaming

246
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,180
Speaker 2:  exclusives are like foundational to how the gaming industry works. Sony

247
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,820
Speaker 2:  has them, Nintendo has them, Microsoft has them. Like this is just, this

248
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,580
Speaker 2:  is just how business is done in the gaming industry. So it's like, okay,

249
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,140
Speaker 2:  why are we mad at Microsoft for trying to get itself some

250
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,820
Speaker 2:  exclusives? And it's, that's complicated. And I think it's mostly just because

251
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,660
Speaker 2:  the FTCs only move to be mad about it is when acquisitions like this happen.

252
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,180
Speaker 2:  So it's just sort of picked its moment to have this bigger fight. Yeah. But

253
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,980
Speaker 2:  then it does seem like there is something potentially unique

254
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,820
Speaker 2:  about Call of Duty, both as like an economic engine and also just like

255
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,780
Speaker 2:  the place it holds in the gaming industry. Yeah. It's just

256
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,820
Speaker 2:  so specifically important to this industry that it, it can

257
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,100
Speaker 2:  actually make those changes in a way that other exclusives can't.

258
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,820
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think, I think there's a couple of things. So Call of Duty is obviously

259
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,340
Speaker 8:  massive and it is, it's, it's also the fact that they deliver a, a version

260
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,140
Speaker 8:  of Call of Duty pretty much every year. Mm. As a AA game that's kind of

261
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,540
Speaker 8:  unheard of in the industry. I mean you have like FIFA and Madden and stuff

262
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,220
Speaker 8:  like that. It to fair

263
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,420
Speaker 2:  To fair it's basically the same game every year most of the time. Exactly.

264
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:39,900
Speaker 2:  But it is

265
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,540
Speaker 8:  Still a game. They changed the crowd, you know? Right. Yeah. It's very iterative

266
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,340
Speaker 8:  isn't it? But the but, but Call of Duty has a narrative driven story

267
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,100
Speaker 8:  content every year without fail pretty much. And that, that is very different

268
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,500
Speaker 8:  of a game to, to sort of other games really in such, in such

269
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,700
Speaker 8:  a way that they do it as where it's so popular as well. So it is different.

270
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,260
Speaker 8:  I would totally agree there. But it's also the other aspect to all of this

271
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,860
Speaker 8:  is Microsoft only Call of Duty is they're only Activision, they're only a

272
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,420
Speaker 8:  big publisher, right? Like that's, Microsoft is obviously a publisher but

273
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,980
Speaker 8:  they are a platform holder as well. They own exports. So if they own

274
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,740
Speaker 8:  a lot of the content as well and that's obviously what they're trying to

275
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,660
Speaker 8:  build for Game Pass and cloud streaming eventually is that the, the power

276
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,820
Speaker 8:  shifts sort switch it switches and network where, where Sony's been buying

277
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,700
Speaker 8:  up individual studios, not necessarily big publishers. Microsoft's obviously

278
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,220
Speaker 8:  going after the publishers like Division Blizzard is, is is a giant one for

279
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,060
Speaker 8:  them. Like if they, if they have that they own such a wider range of

280
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,860
Speaker 8:  content that they can, they can license that they can do it, do what they

281
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,260
Speaker 8:  want with it really. And it really enforces their content library.

282
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,940
Speaker 8:  So Jim Ryan testified yesterday that he doesn't think cloud gaming will be

283
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,860
Speaker 8:  a thing until like 2025 between 2025 and 2035. So

284
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,380
Speaker 8:  he's not thinking it's, it's gonna be a thing for a while. But obviously

285
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,020
Speaker 8:  Microsoft's thinking, well they were and now they claim they're not. But

286
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,780
Speaker 8:  they that that Microsoft is thinking ahead to this cloud era

287
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,460
Speaker 8:  and obviously in that cloud cloud era you need this content and content is

288
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,340
Speaker 8:  key. Call of Duty is obviously key there. If they can deliver that every

289
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,100
Speaker 8:  year from, from now on and ca carry on that cadence and, and get people

290
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,740
Speaker 8:  into Game Pass and and paying for that subscription, then the fear from the

291
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,620
Speaker 8:  FTC side is well what happens when they raise prices down the line? What

292
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,620
Speaker 8:  happens when it's monopolist behavior when they've got all this content?

293
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,740
Speaker 8:  That's the fear. It's not necessarily about impacting consoles cause it's

294
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,540
Speaker 8:  such a small market, but it's how does it affect cloud and in into the mobile

295
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,860
Speaker 8:  gaming market If, if Microsoft's ever able to sort of stream these games

296
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,540
Speaker 8:  reliably to mobile phones, if Apple lets them in the app store or is forced

297
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,420
Speaker 8:  to, eventually that opens up a bigger market. Microsofts looking

298
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,340
Speaker 8:  at by the building and exports game store as well for mobile. So they

299
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,020
Speaker 8:  obviously have big broad ambitions for, for mobile and how that plays into

300
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,980
Speaker 8:  the cloud and stuff. But

301
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,940
Speaker 2:  They've spent a bunch of time during this trial playing those down,

302
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,060
Speaker 2:  right? Like Phil, Phil Spencer and others have kind of come out and said,

303
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,740
Speaker 2:  well we had these big cloud plans, now we're walking them back.

304
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,660
Speaker 2:  Apple won't let us. Like I Is that more of the sort of apples

305
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,380
Speaker 2:  loser strategy or is there actually something there?

306
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,180
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I I mean. So, so there was some testimony from Sarah Bond on the first

307
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,660
Speaker 8:  day where the FTC brought up that last year they were looking at a separate

308
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,660
Speaker 8:  skew, a dedicated version of X cloud exports, cloud gaming, which I think

309
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,820
Speaker 8:  we all kind of assumed would happen. It's been interesting over the past

310
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,060
Speaker 8:  year of X Cloud, Microsoft kind of went, they, they announced a bunch of

311
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,780
Speaker 8:  stuff they were gonna do this streaming device, Xbox cloud gaming on the

312
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,580
Speaker 8:  tv, all of you have content library in X Cloud. And then

313
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,580
Speaker 8:  since the regulators have kind of been involved with this deal, it's all

314
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,500
Speaker 8:  gone quite like that, that that whole library that was supposed to come,

315
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,300
Speaker 8:  supposed to be here by the end of the next year at end of last year, we haven't

316
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,540
Speaker 8:  heard anything about it. That, that that streaming console was

317
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,380
Speaker 8:  mysteriously canceled even though Microsoft was about to announce it.

318
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,020
Speaker 8:  Like they were definitely ready to announce it.

319
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,460
Speaker 2:  We saw it like sitting above behind Phil Spencer in a video, right? Like

320
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Speaker 2:  it was real, it was there.

321
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,100
Speaker 8:  You could argue they've had the strategy shift cuz that that's what Sarah

322
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,900
Speaker 8:  Bon argues, that they looked at the pricing for it and the usage and they

323
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,620
Speaker 8:  thought, okay, we can't introduce this now. Which is probably fair. They,

324
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,140
Speaker 8:  the I mean, let's be honest, no one really uses cloud. Microsoft says

325
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,620
Speaker 8:  they think most people just use it to try games before they download them,

326
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,540
Speaker 8:  which is probably true. That's it's likely true. But at the same time

327
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,100
Speaker 8:  it's are they just pausing work on this stuff until regulators are outta

328
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,820
Speaker 8:  the question and then, and then they can spin it all up again. And at the

329
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,020
Speaker 8:  same time, you've obviously got Sony who hasn't really built a cloud network

330
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,420
Speaker 8:  for PS five, but now they're saying, oh we've, we were building it and testing

331
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,860
Speaker 8:  it now and we're gonna bring it to our subscriptions first. Our subscribers

332
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,700
Speaker 8:  at some point and they're also creating a, a handheld that only plays PS

333
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,380
Speaker 8:  five games that streamed over wifi and presumably over this, this cloud service

334
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,460
Speaker 8:  that they're building now. so like there's, there's obviously they're both

335
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,380
Speaker 8:  putting in sort of a lot of work leading to this

336
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,100
Speaker 8:  cloud sort of war even though everyone's play clouds and they think it sucks

337
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,980
Speaker 8:  now, but it's not gonna forever be like that. Right? So streaming

338
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,900
Speaker 8:  videos on the internet in the early days was terrible until YouTube came

339
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,460
Speaker 8:  along pretty upended everything.

340
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,620
Speaker 2:  So even as Microsoft is saying cloud is the future, we think the

341
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,300
Speaker 2:  console market is small and the cloud market is huge and this is the thing,

342
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,140
Speaker 2:  this is how we get to mobile, all this stuff. They're also saying outside

343
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,980
Speaker 2:  out the other side of their mouth, the console market is small and we're

344
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,420
Speaker 2:  not doing anything else. Why are you so worried about it? Right? Like that's

345
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,820
Speaker 2:  the regulatory story. While they're saying to investors, there's this bigger

346
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,540
Speaker 2:  thing on the horizon.

347
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,220
Speaker 8:  Yeah they, they're saying like the console market is is stagnant essentially

348
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,500
Speaker 8:  and they can't compete in it because obviously Sony's got a bunch of exclusives

349
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,540
Speaker 8:  and they don't, so they need to buy out that content for that. But that the

350
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,100
Speaker 8:  bigger argument is that they're doing it for mobile and then if, if you,

351
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,020
Speaker 8:  if you believe that argument then they're a really small player in mobile

352
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,260
Speaker 8:  right now, so, so who cares. But if you think they're just saying that, that

353
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,140
Speaker 8:  they're going into mobile I mean obviously they are because that's a big

354
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,900
Speaker 8:  revenue opportunity. But also you could still pull back some of that console

355
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,420
Speaker 8:  revenue at the same time as well. Right. They're not surely they don't think

356
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,020
Speaker 8:  that they're not gonna sell more exports consoles if they have a bunch of

357
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,660
Speaker 8:  Activision exclusives, you know, and if they don't have to compete with Sony

358
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,340
Speaker 8:  having a marketing agreement for Call of Duty like, like they do

359
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,380
Speaker 8:  until 2025. So it is always, it's always in the middle, right? These arguments.

360
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,220
Speaker 8:  So, but I, I feel like they're definitely still gearing up for that

361
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,980
Speaker 8:  cloud gaming thing that's not something that they've just suddenly given

362
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,780
Speaker 8:  up on. They've probably slowed it down a bit. The reasons behind that you

363
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,420
Speaker 8:  can take it of one of two ways. Was it regulator pressure

364
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,380
Speaker 8:  or was it you know, strategy and or was it a mix of both? Probably a mix

365
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,300
Speaker 8:  of both arguably. But yeah like they're not

366
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,620
Speaker 8:  gonna take the, the pedal off of that cloud work that's for sure.

367
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,340
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no that makes a lot of sense. I wanna talk about Pete Heinz who I think

368
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,980
Speaker 2:  was one of the most interesting piece of

369
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,180
Speaker 2:  testimony from this whole week. He is like a publishing executive

370
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,300
Speaker 2:  at Bethesda, is that right?

371
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:45,900
Speaker 8:  Yeah, yeah.

372
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,820
Speaker 2:  Which is a big Microsoft publisher. Like this is, this is the last one that

373
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,260
Speaker 2:  they could have done this for before this one. He said a few things that

374
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,340
Speaker 2:  I thought were really interesting. One was he just, he I mean he just shredded

375
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,940
Speaker 2:  the red fall game to bits like over and over and over again.

376
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,180
Speaker 8:  He's like some people might call it a triple A but I don't know.

377
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,780
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then he was like, oh yeah basically this game sucked so don't hold

378
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,860
Speaker 2:  it against us. Sorry everybody. Yeah but the other thing he said that I thought

379
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,220
Speaker 2:  was really interesting was talking about, well A then he also said that the

380
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,060
Speaker 2:  Indiana Jones game is gonna be an Xbox and PC exclusive, which seems

381
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,860
Speaker 2:  like a bad look for Microsoft trying to

382
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,460
Speaker 2:  prove its point because that's presumably gonna be a big game that a lot

383
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,300
Speaker 2:  of people care about, right? Definitely. But then he also just talked about

384
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,060
Speaker 2:  kind of how Bethesda came to be a Microsoft company, which I thought was

385
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,620
Speaker 2:  really interesting and that was when a lot of this kind of debate about how

386
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,580
Speaker 2:  Sony handles third parties and what Sony is doing with its

387
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,300
Speaker 2:  exclusive stuff came up. Like what did we learn from his testimony on that

388
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:40,460
Speaker 2:  front?

389
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,660
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think we learned that Pete Hees was a bit

390
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,460
Speaker 8:  uncomfortable having to do Xbox exclusives initially,

391
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,380
Speaker 8:  although on the stand he wasn't in in the emails and stuff, it paints a

392
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,340
Speaker 8:  picture of him being like, I think, I think a lot of it is when you get acquired

393
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,780
Speaker 8:  by a big company and you go, you know, they try to integrate you in Microsoft

394
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,700
Speaker 8:  hasn't really necessarily integrated Bethesda in fully yet. So there's that

395
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,100
Speaker 8:  like us and them mentality still cuz it's still very

396
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,500
Speaker 8:  run separately and stuff. So I think some of it was like well hang on,

397
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,460
Speaker 8:  Microsoft's promised Sony that they're gonna keep Call of Duty on

398
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,060
Speaker 8:  PlayStation. This was like an email. And he's like, but that's

399
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,020
Speaker 8:  one's you know, opposite to what they said to us, we we were gonna you know,

400
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,220
Speaker 8:  make Redford and Starfield exclusive cause they obviously came in, we know

401
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,900
Speaker 8:  cuz one of the Redford developers said that they yanked the PS five version

402
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,740
Speaker 8:  of the game and obviously we know from this testimony that it was also

403
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,860
Speaker 8:  possibly gonna be a timed or some sort of exclusivity for PS five

404
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,180
Speaker 8:  for for Starfield. So obviously Moses has come in and said no

405
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,420
Speaker 8:  you ain't doing PlayStation, it's Xbox now. So I

406
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,940
Speaker 8:  think we learned that he was not necessarily comfortable with that and he

407
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,460
Speaker 8:  FTC brought up some, some YouTube interview, I think it was with

408
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,260
Speaker 8:  GameSpot when they said that they, you know, was gonna, Starfield was gonna

409
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,940
Speaker 8:  be Xbox exclusive and how he was apologizing to PS five players

410
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,700
Speaker 8:  about it. Right. Which is like ooh, you know at the time it was

411
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,060
Speaker 8:  ooh but when you read all the emails it kind of like makes sense. It's that

412
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,580
Speaker 8:  uneasiness of doing exclusives. But then at the same time when he was on

413
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,460
Speaker 8:  the stand he then defended exclusives which was yeah, what Microsoft

414
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,300
Speaker 8:  would expect him to do, right for Indiana Jones for example. That was obviously

415
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,100
Speaker 8:  that had a, a contract with Disney for it to be on multiple consoles

416
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,300
Speaker 8:  and then obviously Microsoft acquired Bethesda then that changed

417
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,380
Speaker 8:  and it became Xbox and PC and he defended it saying you know,

418
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,180
Speaker 8:  like essentially it makes it more streamlined for us to dev

419
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,260
Speaker 8:  develop this game for which is true, you know, sure you didn't have to worry

420
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,740
Speaker 8:  about multiple consoles, all that sort of stuff. That is, that is true and

421
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,580
Speaker 8:  he defended it in that sort of way and he, he said

422
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,700
Speaker 8:  something to the effect of like, we wouldn't be shipping Starfield, you know,

423
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,580
Speaker 8:  however many weeks it is, eight weeks or whatever it is. If we were

424
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,260
Speaker 8:  also on PlayStation insinuating and the, you know, having those mob platforms

425
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,500
Speaker 8:  slows down the game development which obviously is is true as well.

426
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,380
Speaker 8:  So yeah, so it's obviously he's slightly changed his mind

427
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,780
Speaker 8:  from from the emails but I think some of these emails were just frustration

428
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,300
Speaker 8:  right at at having to explain this stuff to play to to players and gamers

429
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,620
Speaker 8:  for sure.

430
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,580
Speaker 2:  But I do think if I'm the FTC lawyers, that's one piece of it where

431
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,940
Speaker 2:  you're like, yes we got one because yeah, the, the case they're trying to

432
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,900
Speaker 2:  make here essentially is that Microsoft can say all the right things for

433
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,940
Speaker 2:  as long as it wants until the acquisition closes and then it can just change

434
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,580
Speaker 2:  its mind about how all of this works and there's really nothing to

435
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,300
Speaker 2:  prevent it from making all of those changes. Like Phil Spencer,

436
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,980
Speaker 2:  what like literally raised his hand and was like we will keep Call of Duty

437
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,780
Speaker 2:  on the PlayStation five and it's like the number five is doing a lot of work

438
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,980
Speaker 2:  in that sentence but also like they can say this stuff all they want but

439
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,620
Speaker 2:  there's very little to prevent them from making this change other than if

440
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,020
Speaker 2:  there is sort of an economic benefit to it. And what the Bethesda example

441
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,780
Speaker 2:  seems to prove is that maybe even if there is, there are things that outweigh

442
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,780
Speaker 2:  that economic benefit. So if I'm the FTC it's like look, they've done this

443
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,300
Speaker 2:  before, this is the worst case scenario. The thing we're trying to avoid

444
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,220
Speaker 8:  And I think that's like Microsoft is happy for the conversation to be all

445
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,580
Speaker 8:  about Call of Duty cuz they can have Phil Spencer stand there on oath and

446
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,820
Speaker 8:  say you know, I swear I'll put my hand up, this is gonna be on PlayStation,

447
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,380
Speaker 8:  you don't have to worry about it. But as soon as it veers into like all of

448
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,780
Speaker 8:  Activision games then it starts to get murky, right? Cuz they obviously wanna

449
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,180
Speaker 8:  pick and choose which ones like they did with Bethesda, which ones to make

450
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,340
Speaker 8:  exclusive and then which ones to say okay yeah we have to have that on the

451
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,900
Speaker 8:  PlayStation because in their best interests for revenue, right? Like they're

452
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,340
Speaker 8:  not gonna pull a game. Like they're not gonna pull call a G from PlayStation

453
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,460
Speaker 8:  are they, when there's tons of revenue opportunity there,

454
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,540
Speaker 2:  It's like capitalist suicide to not sell to Call of Duty to most

455
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,500
Speaker 2:  people. Yeah that's, it would be a terrible idea

456
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,260
Speaker 8:  But, but over the years when they try and sort of sway pull people towards

457
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,540
Speaker 8:  Game Pass with those incentives and they have all the market, they, they're

458
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,860
Speaker 8:  not gonna give Sony a marketing deal for court of duty are they, you know,

459
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,300
Speaker 8:  in in those commercials you see at the end of like football games and stuff

460
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,980
Speaker 8:  like that. You're not, this is going be all experts now. So that will

461
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,300
Speaker 8:  eventually push people over I think is the FTCs argument as well.

462
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,580
Speaker 2:  Let's come back to the cloud and mobile thing really fast because that seems

463
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,380
Speaker 2:  to be as we kind of look out to the next few years of where

464
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,820
Speaker 2:  this would go, that seems to be kind of the big open question, right? It's

465
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,020
Speaker 2:  like the, is Nintendo a real competitor is the sort of right now question

466
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,100
Speaker 2:  but like how big is cloud and how much is Xbox gonna matter

467
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,140
Speaker 2:  on mobile in the next like 10 years is kind of the the unknown thing everybody's

468
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,100
Speaker 2:  trying to figure out. And Nvidia ended up playing a surprisingly big

469
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,660
Speaker 2:  role in this in a way that I really didn't know any of the history of

470
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,140
Speaker 2:  how did it come to be that Nvidia ended up on the stand here at all?

471
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,340
Speaker 8:  Yeah, so Nvidia was on the stand briefly yesterday but they've been referenced

472
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,020
Speaker 8:  a bunch throughout the day. So essentially when they first did

473
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,940
Speaker 8:  G-Force, now they, their cloud gaming streaming service and they had

474
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,180
Speaker 8:  a beta of it and it had a bunch of television games on it including Call

475
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,620
Speaker 8:  of Duty and they had some sort of weird agreement with Blizzard

476
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,620
Speaker 8:  around those games apparently and that they were there on beta

477
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,020
Speaker 8:  and then Activision were like now we're gonna pull it. So they pulled those

478
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,060
Speaker 8:  games off of off of there and that was their stance cause they obviously

479
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,660
Speaker 8:  were happy to play around with it and be part of this new thing

480
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,580
Speaker 8:  cuz it was emerging there. I mean obviously cloud is still very nascent but,

481
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,540
Speaker 8:  but they were obviously happy to be there early on but then they were like,

482
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,140
Speaker 8:  hang on a minute, we can make some money here, we should lock this up. Like

483
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,220
Speaker 2:  It reminds me of like the early days of Netflix when everybody, Netflix is

484
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,500
Speaker 2:  like, we wanna stream stuff on the internet and all the studios were like

485
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,460
Speaker 2:  whatever, okay here you go, give us $10, we'll call it a day. And then everybody's

486
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,980
Speaker 2:  like, oh this is actually successful and might be a thing like hold on, yeah

487
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,740
Speaker 2:  let's let's have a new conversation. Yeah, it feels like that's what happened

488
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,580
Speaker 2:  here too. Exactly.

489
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,580
Speaker 8:  Yeah so, so they were involved obviously there and then you had Matt

490
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,500
Speaker 8:  Buty the experts, game studios chief who had recommended

491
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,060
Speaker 8:  once they acquired Bethesda to pull their games off of GForce now

492
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,340
Speaker 8:  and that they'd already pulled their own ones. The Microsoft first party

493
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,860
Speaker 8:  one Xbox ones not as, not to compete with X Cloud

494
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,740
Speaker 8:  but it was the quote so it's obviously they don't, they don't want those

495
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,300
Speaker 8:  games on there cause they compete with their own streaming service and that

496
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,900
Speaker 8:  was the strategy back in, I think that was 2021, that email and then obviously

497
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,540
Speaker 8:  you come to this year when regulatory pressure,

498
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,340
Speaker 8:  particularly the CMA of obviously blocked over cloud concerns this deal

499
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,060
Speaker 8:  and the EU was sort of hinting at cloud concerns as well. Microsoft went

500
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,820
Speaker 8:  out and done a bunch of deals with cloud gaming companies like Boost Steroid

501
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,900
Speaker 8:  and Nvidia. So basically offer them their own export PC games

502
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,460
Speaker 8:  on the service and you know, if the deal closes Call of Duty and other ads

503
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,180
Speaker 8:  provision titles. So they've obviously played a key role because they were

504
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,100
Speaker 8:  opposed to the deal initially when the FTC and the CMA and all

505
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,900
Speaker 8:  that were doing, you know, talking to Nvidia, they were like, yeah we

506
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,300
Speaker 8:  don't want this deal because obviously they've had their games pulled off

507
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,660
Speaker 8:  the service but in Microsoft swooped in, I was like here's a deal. And then

508
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,580
Speaker 8:  they were like, we love you Microsoft, please whatever

509
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,500
Speaker 8:  we said before to the FTC, it is irrelevant, right? So obviously the

510
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,020
Speaker 8:  FTC is trying to say that, you know, like Microsoft has got this deal but

511
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,620
Speaker 8:  interestingly the FTC kind of causes deals like irrelevant and the terms

512
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,220
Speaker 8:  of them aren't very good. We don't really know the terms obviously we haven't,

513
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,340
Speaker 8:  you know, we haven't got the, the deal sort of documented in front of us.

514
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,380
Speaker 8:  So it is interesting to see that. But they have argued in a roundabout way

515
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,260
Speaker 8:  that the deals obviously mean people still have to have a Windows license

516
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,900
Speaker 8:  like the the, the actual companies have to a Windows server license to serve

517
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,780
Speaker 8:  these games and they brought sort of stadia on the stand to say that as well.

518
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,380
Speaker 8:  And obviously Chief Horse now we've seen a little bit of testimony

519
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,100
Speaker 8:  around that, not too much, it was like a nine minute video but it kind of

520
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,940
Speaker 8:  like half backed the FTC a little bit and then it was like Microsoft

521
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,740
Speaker 8:  came in and just said well you know, we signed these deals and they're like

522
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,660
Speaker 8:  yeah it is great, it solves our problems literally. So it's like

523
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,540
Speaker 8:  they've had an interesting role to play for sure but, but based on the fact

524
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,300
Speaker 8:  that their games were blocked initially by big publishers.

525
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,500
Speaker 2:  Okay, so we have one more day of real testimony including like you said Satya

526
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,060
Speaker 2:  Nadella and Bobby Kodak and then we have closing arguments on Thursday. A

527
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,020
Speaker 2:  any, any sort of big things you're expecting big like unknown

528
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,020
Speaker 2:  open questions left for the next day or so of this.

529
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,060
Speaker 8:  Well I guess we had Jim Ryan yesterday who basically testified

530
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,060
Speaker 8:  that he spoke to Bobby Kotick at some European Commission

531
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,300
Speaker 8:  meetings earlier this year and he said he just wanted to block the deal and

532
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,940
Speaker 8:  that Bobby was trying to negotiate some sort of Call of Duty deal

533
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,740
Speaker 8:  if their transaction failed. So obviously Bobby's paying to both sides, right?

534
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,620
Speaker 8:  Yeah because sure business, which was interesting. So I dunno whether Bobby

535
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,300
Speaker 8:  Kotick will be questioned about that potentially I, I'd assume and some of

536
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,540
Speaker 8:  the, some of the deals but also Sarah Bond mentioned in her

537
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,500
Speaker 8:  testimony that Activision almost forced Microsoft into

538
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,460
Speaker 8:  renegotiating the rate that they give publishers. So

539
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,220
Speaker 8:  it's usually a 70 30 split, right? That's pretty typical. Apple does it Google

540
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,180
Speaker 8:  every, everyone does that split right to a certain degree and they've actually

541
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,500
Speaker 8:  been negotiating 80 twenties with some publishers and

542
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,060
Speaker 8:  apparently Activision to force them to negotiate that split to get Call of

543
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,620
Speaker 8:  Duty optimized for export series X at launch when they'd already

544
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,860
Speaker 8:  negotiated with Sony. So they were kind of using it as a beating stick saying,

545
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,620
Speaker 8:  you know, PS five's gonna have an optimized version of Call of Duty but you

546
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,500
Speaker 8:  won't unless you give us more revenue from every game sale. So that'll be

547
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,540
Speaker 8:  interesting to hear whether that comes up. So I think that the Bobby code

548
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,180
Speaker 8:  te testimony could be interesting. Satya Nadella, as much as I love him,

549
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,300
Speaker 8:  is not the most interesting to hear from

550
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,460
Speaker 2:  Not a gamer that man I don't

551
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,820
Speaker 8:  Think. Not a gamer, no. So I, I'm not sure, I'm not entirely sure how his

552
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,540
Speaker 8:  testimony is gonna go, but I mean he's, he's obviously, he's a very intelligent

553
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,660
Speaker 8:  and he speaks very well and he, he's very aware of

554
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,500
Speaker 8:  the I mean he might not be a gamer but he's very aware of the gaming market.

555
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,380
Speaker 8:  So I think we're gonna get some interesting insights into exactly why

556
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,900
Speaker 8:  he is willing to give the company or the, the exports division

557
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,860
Speaker 8:  his biggest ever acquisition when apparently they're third place in consoles

558
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,740
Speaker 8:  and struggling and all that sort of stuff. So I think we, we, we get some

559
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,420
Speaker 8:  sort of color around that. But yeah, today's obviously the big day with the

560
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,300
Speaker 8:  big CEOs but I think we have had the other big days with the fact

561
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,660
Speaker 8:  the Phil Spencer testimony and the Jim Ryan testimony that those, Jim Ryans

562
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,420
Speaker 8:  was quite kind of small but Phil's was quite large and quite a lot of stuff

563
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,020
Speaker 8:  covered in that. So it's particularly his feelings about Sony's, you know,

564
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,700
Speaker 8:  evil competition, all this sort of stuff. So I feel like we're recap on some

565
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,340
Speaker 8:  of that sort of stuff and yeah, it could be an interesting day, but I think

566
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,420
Speaker 8:  the biggest testimony we've already had, I think personally

567
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,580
Speaker 2:  Makes sense. All right, well you gotta go get ready for that and we need

568
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,060
Speaker 2:  to take a break, but thank you Tom as always, good luck. I hope this doesn't

569
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,060
Speaker 2:  end at midnight for you. We're all

570
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,860
Speaker 8:  Root for, you know, I'm gonna be like crying if it does. All right

571
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,180
Speaker 1:  Soon.

572
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,320
Speaker 9:  I'm Nam Aza and I produce and I'm on the podcast on with Kara

573
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,640
Speaker 9:  Swisher. Last week Kara and I went out to Martha Stewart's house

574
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,120
Speaker 9:  and it was, well just have a listen. It's great. Let's

575
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,880
Speaker 9:  set the scene a little bit.

576
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,520
Speaker 10:  Okay. The scene is we come in, we get taken in another vehicle throughout

577
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,000
Speaker 10:  the estate. There's chickens, there's peacocks,

578
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,440
Speaker 9:  There's horses, there's horses,

579
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,200
Speaker 10:  There's

580
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,000
Speaker 9:  Stables, and there's a giant copper pot, which is the size of you actually

581
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,880
Speaker 9:  get in the copper pot. It's ly size of you.

582
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,680
Speaker 10:  I'm not leaving here.

583
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,920
Speaker 9:  She could cook us into chili and that thing she might, if the interview gets

584
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,400
Speaker 9:  too tough, she

585
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,240
Speaker 10:  Would and it would be delicious.

586
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,640
Speaker 9:  Don't worry, we didn't get cooked in the cold cauldron. But thanks to Martha Stewart,

587
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,880
Speaker 9:  the interview did get spicy.

588
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,400
Speaker 11:  I was hired by Mark Burnett to fire Donald.

589
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,720
Speaker 11:  Oh okay. To say you fired just Like. he had said to hundreds of

590
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,520
Speaker 11:  people right during his apprentice I was to fire him and take

591
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:23,720
Speaker 11:  over,

592
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,120
Speaker 9:  Oh Martha, to hear why she says she didn't get to fire Trump. Listen to

593
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,920
Speaker 9:  On with Kara Swisher, wherever you get your podcasts,

594
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,780
Speaker 12:  We have clients that are Titanic enthusiasts, which we refer

595
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,620
Speaker 12:  to as Titanics. We've had people who have mortgaged their home

596
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,460
Speaker 12:  to come and do the trip and we have people who don't think twice about

597
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,060
Speaker 12:  a trip of this, this cost.

598
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,660
Speaker 13:  For the record, the trip cost $250,000.

599
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,060
Speaker 13:  That was Stockton Rush, the founder of Ocean Gate Expeditions and one of

600
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,740
Speaker 13:  five men who died when a submersible bound for the wreckage of the

601
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,660
Speaker 13:  Titanic imploded on today explained a deep sea explorer and a friend

602
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,180
Speaker 13:  of one of the passengers tells us that he saw this coming

603
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,180
Speaker 14:  The old line that says, A man needs to know his limitations

604
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,260
Speaker 14:  and you just can't fix stupid and stupid games will win you

605
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,060
Speaker 14:  stupid prizes. It was unnecessary. Everyone in the industry

606
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,940
Speaker 14:  knew that this vessel had no business being out there,

607
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,620
Speaker 14:  had no business being on the Titanic,

608
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:29,340
Speaker 14:  none

609
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,540
Speaker 13:  Today explained in your feeds every weekday at 2:00 PM

610
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,820
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Congress is back in session in the US and one of the

611
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,260
Speaker 2:  issues being most hotly debated right now is child safety

612
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,940
Speaker 2:  Online. We have a bunch of new bills in play. There are some big

613
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:51,780
Speaker 2:  ideas about technically speaking how kids can be protected online.

614
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,540
Speaker 2:  And, as always, there's some fiery talk about who's to blame and

615
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,540
Speaker 2:  what has gone wrong online. The verges, Makena Kelly has been following all

616
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,940
Speaker 2:  of these efforts and talking to the folks trying to get these new bills passed

617
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,060
Speaker 2:  and she's here to tell us what's going on and whether any of it might

618
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,140
Speaker 2:  amount to anything. Makena, hello, Welcome back. It's

619
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,660
Speaker 15:  Great to be here.

620
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,780
Speaker 2:  We have a bunch to talk about, but I realized in prepping for this, that

621
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,940
Speaker 2:  coppa, which is this big bill about this big law,

622
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,980
Speaker 2:  about child protection online is way older than I realized. So

623
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,540
Speaker 2:  I wanted to start with not quite a history lesson, but like

624
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,700
Speaker 2:  let's look back at coppa, right? So this thing was passed in 1999, went into

625
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,620
Speaker 2:  effect in 2000 and has basically governed the way we think

626
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,460
Speaker 2:  about child protection online for 23 years

627
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,220
Speaker 2:  now. It's still everywhere. We still talk about it all the time. Is this

628
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,740
Speaker 2:  a good law? Like what, what is the sort of vibe around what

629
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,500
Speaker 2:  Kapa is doing to the internet 23 years later?

630
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,620
Speaker 15:  So yeah, the wild thing that you bring up about coppa, which stands for

631
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,860
Speaker 15:  the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act is, yeah, it's been around

632
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,740
Speaker 15:  forever and most importantly it's like the only real

633
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,620
Speaker 15:  privacy law on the books. Like we talk about, you know, having some

634
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,340
Speaker 15:  kind of nationwide privacy framework, all of that COPPA is pretty much what

635
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,820
Speaker 15:  we got other than, you know, some minor things here and there and then maybe

636
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,940
Speaker 15:  some stronger things at the state level. I don't know if you remember, this

637
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,740
Speaker 15:  is what I say when I try and explain it, but when I signed up for a

638
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,860
Speaker 15:  Neopets account in like 2009 Yep. I

639
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,780
Speaker 15:  had to click some box that said I

640
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,780
Speaker 15:  am over 13 years old. Yep. I think people have had

641
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,100
Speaker 15:  that kind of relationship with the internet that, or even there was, there

642
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,700
Speaker 15:  was some websites where I had to put in my parents' email

643
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,620
Speaker 15:  before I could have access to it and they had to like say, okay, yeah, they're

644
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,660
Speaker 15:  whatever and they can use this. So that was essentially put in place by

645
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,220
Speaker 15:  COPPA and that's how online platforms were using it at the time.

646
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,580
Speaker 15:  It's still kind of that way now, but essentially like Facebook does

647
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,060
Speaker 15:  the same thing. Like you're not supposed to have a Facebook page unless

648
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,820
Speaker 15:  you're like over 13. So it's stayed pretty much the same for like you said,

649
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,540
Speaker 15:  23 years. And the important thing about COPPA is

650
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,940
Speaker 15:  that when we talk about the companies that we talk about on the site

651
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,420
Speaker 15:  constantly meta, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok,

652
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,540
Speaker 15:  Amazon, so many of them when it comes to being

653
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,980
Speaker 15:  sued or having settlements with the government, it comes from Kapa

654
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,980
Speaker 15:  multimillion dollar settlements for breaching certain parts of

655
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,900
Speaker 15:  Kapa and doing things that the government deems harmful to

656
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,020
Speaker 15:  children. So COPPA is basically the biggest weapon that the federal

657
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,620
Speaker 15:  government has on data privacy and it's only, you know, protecting kids

658
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,300
Speaker 15:  under 13.

659
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,660
Speaker 2:  By the way, I love the idea of thinking about laws as what

660
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,700
Speaker 2:  check boxes do they introduce to the internet? Like that's, that's just a

661
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,260
Speaker 2:  very good way of thinking about privacy laws, like what check boxes do they

662
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,180
Speaker 2:  add and what pop-ups are required As a result, you can kind of sort 25

663
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,300
Speaker 2:  years of tech legal fighting by check boxes and pop-ups,

664
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,980
Speaker 2:  but there's been fights and debates over changing

665
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:59,140
Speaker 2:  Kapa and updating it and having new things over the years. But

666
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,820
Speaker 2:  what I can't tell I guess is whether this is like a very sort of prescient

667
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,940
Speaker 2:  and durable law in a way that I think Section two 30 has been

668
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,260
Speaker 2:  over time, like Section two 30 has grown to do a lot more work than anyone

669
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,300
Speaker 2:  expected it to, but still kind of does its work, right? Or if Kapa is like

670
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,300
Speaker 2:  hopelessly outdated and we should have changed it a long time ago. It's just

671
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,340
Speaker 2:  that this is the kind of law that takes forever to change. Do you have a

672
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,540
Speaker 2:  sense of which one it is?

673
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,380
Speaker 15:  I think most Democrats, if they don't support

674
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,740
Speaker 15:  stronger child protections that come in a different law,

675
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,820
Speaker 15:  they want COPPA to be updated. COPPA is strong,

676
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,660
Speaker 15:  it's proven. This is the thing that's really important is that it's already

677
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,180
Speaker 15:  proven to be constitutional. It's held up in the courts, you know, it's

678
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,860
Speaker 15:  already been litigated. So COPPA is something that they don't really have

679
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,740
Speaker 15:  to worry about updating it. Whereas when you think about new laws

680
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,220
Speaker 15:  like the Kids Online Safety Act, things that we'll talk about later, these

681
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,020
Speaker 15:  could be put up to legal challenges for being unconstitutional.

682
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,780
Speaker 15:  I think when you talk to lawmakers, COPPA is just extremely durable. It

683
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,300
Speaker 15:  is a law that's withstood litigation, it's proved to be constitutional,

684
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:07,060
Speaker 15:  there's bills out there to update it. I think it's the easiest path forward,

685
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,420
Speaker 15:  but if it's the right move that's currently what's being debated in Congress

686
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:11,900
Speaker 15:  right now.

687
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,140
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. So yeah, let's talk about what's happening in Congress right

688
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,780
Speaker 2:  now. You wrote a story I think in May, basically saying there's

689
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,940
Speaker 2:  a lot of energy around child privacy online again, and this seems to

690
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,700
Speaker 2:  happen in waves kind of based on what's coming in the news and usually

691
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,660
Speaker 2:  like a Facebook scandal of some kind. A lot of people get excited and then

692
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,100
Speaker 2:  it fades as we talk about other things and then it comes back and right now

693
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,940
Speaker 2:  it is back in like a very big way. What is kind of leading the debate

694
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,020
Speaker 2:  at this particular moment as we talk about child safety again?

695
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,140
Speaker 15:  Right? So when we talk about regulating tech, there

696
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,020
Speaker 15:  is a series of things that normally happens, something bad happens, a tech

697
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,860
Speaker 15:  company does something, Congress freaks out, they talk about it

698
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,340
Speaker 15:  for a little bit until they forget and another really big bad thing happens

699
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,380
Speaker 15:  and draws them away.

700
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,140
Speaker 2:  Well you're forgetting the part where Josh Hawley introduces legislation.

701
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,060
Speaker 2:  That's one very important necessary step that

702
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,340
Speaker 15:  Josh Hawley introduces a bill to allow you to sue for things. Yeah, exactly.

703
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,540
Speaker 15:  That man loves to sue. He loves to sue.

704
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,420
Speaker 15:  So while that new big bad thing is happening, like I said, the states

705
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,580
Speaker 15:  are still a little bit behind and they're still working on what that big

706
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,060
Speaker 15:  tech company did that was bad. And right now we're in this part

707
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:24,580
Speaker 15:  where the states have already put out so

708
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,260
Speaker 15:  much legislation that has become law, basically childproofing the

709
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,020
Speaker 15:  internet in many, many ways. and Congress is looking at that

710
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,300
Speaker 15:  and being like, oh crap, we need to do something now. And so there's

711
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,980
Speaker 15:  a handful of bills that have been put out and the wild thing is,

712
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,660
Speaker 15:  yeah, I, I, when I look at this, it's like this is the one thing tech-wise

713
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,580
Speaker 15:  that I can imagine Congress doing this year. It sounds like a very admirable

714
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,460
Speaker 15:  thing to protect children online, but when you do these things and

715
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,420
Speaker 15:  like we've seen with the state laws, they have a real impact

716
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,220
Speaker 15:  and could I should say, could have a real impact on civil rights

717
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,060
Speaker 15:  for not just children, right, but for everyone on the internet.

718
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,540
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. So big picture, like you said, there are a bunch of bills and

719
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,980
Speaker 2:  I want to get into some of the specific ones, but do we

720
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,140
Speaker 2:  agree on kind of big picture what the

721
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,620
Speaker 2:  solutions are to this problem? Like you say, childproofing the internet,

722
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,940
Speaker 2:  right? That's sort of a big vague term that I think most people kind of agree

723
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,740
Speaker 2:  on. Do we have a sense of what everybody actually wants

724
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,420
Speaker 2:  to do, even sort of in broad strokes here?

725
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,820
Speaker 15:  I think the best answer to that is just protect kids. What protect

726
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,740
Speaker 15:  kids means is very different. So there are some

727
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,980
Speaker 15:  laws like the ones that have gone into effect in Texas and Louisiana

728
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,180
Speaker 15:  that is just strictly restricting a minor's access to the internet. You

729
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,060
Speaker 15:  cannot create certain accounts with social media platforms without

730
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,980
Speaker 15:  explicit permission from your parents. In some instances that sounds great

731
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,300
Speaker 15:  for lawmakers, but then you kind of peel back the layers of this and

732
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,020
Speaker 15:  you look at, oh my gosh, well what if a child is in an abusive

733
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,860
Speaker 15:  situation with their parents? What if a queer kid is looking for

734
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,820
Speaker 15:  resources online? They, they can't sign up for these

735
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,980
Speaker 15:  websites, they can't go into these forums, they can't receive these resources

736
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:14,180
Speaker 15:  without basically outing themselves to their parents, which is so

737
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,100
Speaker 15:  oftentimes the last thing they want to do. And so that gets

738
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,980
Speaker 15:  at the heart of the problem of these bills and what they end up doing. When

739
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,100
Speaker 15:  we talk about what is the solution, it's a, it's a handful of different

740
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,020
Speaker 15:  things that people have proposed and there's a handful of issues. So

741
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,980
Speaker 15:  the one thing is just like making sure kids aren't accessing really bad

742
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,340
Speaker 15:  content and they can't see it. We've heard a lot about disordered eating

743
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,500
Speaker 15:  content, basically, you know, pro ana stuff. Anyone who's on

744
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,340
Speaker 15:  Tumblr in the 2010s has seen this like prota content and

745
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,340
Speaker 15:  having social media platforms over moderate that and

746
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,020
Speaker 15:  that, yeah, that might sound great at face. Like I don't wanna see prota

747
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,420
Speaker 15:  content that can be triggering to a lot of people, but then it's like, oh,

748
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,060
Speaker 15:  how does a tech platform actually moderate that?

749
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,180
Speaker 15:  They might just be going ahead and removing all content

750
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:06,500
Speaker 15:  related to eating disorders. Stuff that is actually like resources like

751
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,380
Speaker 15:  we said, or people posting TikTok being like, this is how I

752
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,300
Speaker 15:  overcame this eating disorder. And it could encourage platforms to

753
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,620
Speaker 15:  over moderate in a way that could be challenged as being

754
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,580
Speaker 15:  unconstitutional and violating the first amendment.

755
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,220
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then it, it does seem like we've been in this place for a long

756
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,140
Speaker 2:  time where those are the trade-offs and that seems to be, at least from my

757
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,420
Speaker 2:  perspective, what has held this up over and over and over again is it's like,

758
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,180
Speaker 2:  okay, this stuff is like you said, sort of admirable and in the

759
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,180
Speaker 2:  positive case everybody kind of agrees this is what we should do, right?

760
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,980
Speaker 2:  Like we, we should have better controls for what kids see. Parents

761
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,900
Speaker 2:  should have more, but then it's like there's just edge case after edge case

762
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,740
Speaker 2:  after edge case after edge case. And it seems like that has bogged all of

763
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:51,580
Speaker 2:  this down, but you've been talking to people about this new run of bills.

764
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,420
Speaker 2:  You talked to Ed Markey, I know, and a couple of other folks I think, and

765
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,500
Speaker 2:  I'm guessing after, or at least I'm hoping after all of

766
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,260
Speaker 2:  these other tries to do this and we've been back and forth through all of

767
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,420
Speaker 2:  this that maybe we have found some new

768
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,100
Speaker 2:  strategies and nuances that we can figure out here. Like walk

769
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,300
Speaker 2:  me through kind of what you've heard from these folks this time around.

770
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,700
Speaker 15:  So Senator Ed Markey is the senator from Massachusetts and he was the

771
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,260
Speaker 15:  original author of coppa, the bill that we've been talking about that has

772
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,820
Speaker 15:  been used, you know, hundreds of times. He, for the last couple years

773
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,060
Speaker 15:  has been putting out something called COPPA 2.0. I spoke to him a couple

774
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,580
Speaker 15:  weeks ago about that and what that bill exactly does.

775
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,580
Speaker 16:  COPPA 2.0, it says very

776
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,900
Speaker 16:  specifically that companies must get consent before

777
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,500
Speaker 16:  collecting data about users age 13 to 16

778
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,020
Speaker 16:  bans targeted ads to children and teens, which are

779
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:51,740
Speaker 16:  inherently manipulative and it actually creates an online

780
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,540
Speaker 16:  eraser button so kids and parents can tell companies to delete

781
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,340
Speaker 16:  the data they've collected about child users. It

782
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,220
Speaker 16:  ultimately then creates a digital privacy bill of rights for children

783
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,700
Speaker 16:  and teens in our country.

784
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,020
Speaker 15:  Sounds great.

785
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,060
Speaker 2:  It

786
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,980
Speaker 15:  Does compared to a lot of what's being proposed in Congress. And I

787
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,220
Speaker 15:  think when you look at Markey's bill, it is one of the bills that makes

788
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:19,180
Speaker 15:  fewer changes that would do fewer things. When we look at

789
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,860
Speaker 15:  other bills with the potential to be passed, there's the Kids Online Safety

790
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,140
Speaker 15:  Act that was introduced, that's a bipartisan bill introduced by Senator

791
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,980
Speaker 15:  Marsha Blackburn and Senator Richard Blumenthal that does a wide variety

792
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,060
Speaker 15:  of things. It touches on the moderation stuff that we talked about before,

793
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,060
Speaker 15:  which the bill could encourage platforms to over moderate

794
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,380
Speaker 15:  content that the bill decides could be harmful for kids.

795
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:43,940
Speaker 15:  Then there's another bill that Senator Brian Schatz put out called the Protecting

796
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,500
Speaker 15:  Kids Online Act. And that starts

797
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,260
Speaker 15:  something that has spooked a lot of people, which is like a nationwide pilot

798
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,860
Speaker 15:  program on age verification. Ah, yes. So making

799
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,860
Speaker 15:  counts online, you would have to basically

800
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:03,220
Speaker 15:  show your ID to show that you are above the above a certain age

801
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,900
Speaker 15:  and that has spooked a lot of people

802
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,260
Speaker 2:  What could go wrong,

803
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:11,340
Speaker 15:  Right? Basically just uploading your ID to platforms

804
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,500
Speaker 15:  that who knows where that data could go. So that would be a

805
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,300
Speaker 15:  pilot program. The marque build does not do age verification. It

806
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,300
Speaker 15:  basically follows through on like a lot of what the initial COPPA does,

807
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:26,340
Speaker 15:  which is if a content is, looks like it should

808
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,300
Speaker 15:  be for a kid, you just, you know, abide by COPPA from that. It's more of

809
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,060
Speaker 15:  like an assumption rather than a confirmation. And

810
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,380
Speaker 15:  yeah, that spooked folks pretty bad because when

811
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,220
Speaker 15:  we talk about protecting privacy, you don't want to make

812
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,100
Speaker 15:  people offer up even more data to protect kids. You're

813
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,300
Speaker 15:  then requiring even more data from people

814
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,460
Speaker 15:  25, 35 45, you know, anybody on the internet.

815
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,620
Speaker 2:  One thing Marky said in that clip you played is the age

816
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:00,700
Speaker 2:  16, which feels like I, I think I've seen this come up in

817
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,260
Speaker 2:  a bunch of these discussions that 13, and I actually, I don't know if Kapa

818
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,300
Speaker 2:  did this or not, but there was at some point where 13 was sort of established

819
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,660
Speaker 2:  as like the the age at which you were allowed to use the internet. And I

820
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,060
Speaker 2:  think we can have lots of interesting arguments over whether that is too

821
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,820
Speaker 2:  young or too old or whatever. But it seems like more recently, and you've

822
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,460
Speaker 2:  covered this a bunch, there's been a push to make that age 16 and instead

823
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,340
Speaker 2:  of 13 is that marquee is that somebody else? Like what's going on here?

824
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,460
Speaker 15:  So the Markey bill moves it up to 16 I think with the Francis Hogan

825
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,940
Speaker 15:  revelations about how Instagram and Facebook

826
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,540
Speaker 15:  has inflicted, you know, actual real harm on kids that's

827
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,140
Speaker 15:  kind of had senators and lawmakers thinking about, oh my gosh, well

828
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,180
Speaker 15:  you have a ton of kids online with unfettered access to the

829
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,740
Speaker 15:  internet, seeing things that they necessar that could be really

830
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,580
Speaker 15:  damaging. And what's changed since CAPA

831
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,660
Speaker 15:  and what's been really pressing for lawmakers is that we're actually undergoing

832
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,820
Speaker 15:  a nationwide mental health crisis for youth.

833
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,660
Speaker 15:  We can debate like what is actually causing this, but the surgeon General,

834
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,780
Speaker 15:  for example, has put out social media as one of these reasons.

835
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,860
Speaker 15:  And so that, you know, when we talk about a youth mental health health crisis,

836
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:17,060
Speaker 15:  that is everyone under the age of 18 and those kids lawmakers

837
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,580
Speaker 15:  seeing need the same protections.

838
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,020
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. Folks on the other side of this who have been, you know, the

839
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,460
Speaker 2:  civil liberties groups and the internet freedom groups and the sort of free

840
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,180
Speaker 2:  speech maximalist, what do they make of this

841
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,460
Speaker 2:  new round of bills? I mean? It seems like Ed Markey in particular with COPPA

842
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,020
Speaker 2:  2.0 is trying to do kind of as little as possible in order to

843
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:39,220
Speaker 2:  make some changes without sort of blowing up the whole thing. Which I guess

844
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,260
Speaker 2:  probably goes back to what you're talking about, about Kapa being kind of

845
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,220
Speaker 2:  tested and proven and constitutional and it's like, okay, how much

846
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,180
Speaker 2:  can we change that without having to sort of reinvent the wheel and do this

847
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:54,140
Speaker 2:  all over again? Is it possible to do that stuff without making this other

848
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,060
Speaker 2:  side angry? Like are are, what do they make of this new round

849
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,380
Speaker 2:  of things?

850
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:02,700
Speaker 15:  Experts are really freaked out by this. Okay. For a

851
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,220
Speaker 15:  wide variety of reasons. I spoke to India

852
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,380
Speaker 15:  McKinney from the Electronic Frontier Foundation about these bills

853
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,220
Speaker 15:  and I got the answer that I think everyone has been thinking about

854
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,460
Speaker 15:  this is we need a strong comprehensive

855
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,060
Speaker 15:  data privacy framework for everyone.

856
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,540
Speaker 17:  A strong, comprehensive, federal consumer data privacy

857
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:29,020
Speaker 17:  bill that is consumer driven, consumer focused that gives power to

858
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,700
Speaker 17:  consumers that will actually help everybody including children.

859
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,740
Speaker 17:  And it may sound like it's harder, like children's privacy

860
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,900
Speaker 17:  sounds easier because who was gonna argue with children's privacy?

861
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,300
Speaker 17:  But as soon as you introduce this new additional component of determining

862
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,340
Speaker 17:  who is a child that ups the difficulty level, you don't have

863
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,180
Speaker 17:  to do that. You could just go back to doing privacy for everyone and

864
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,700
Speaker 17:  a rising tide lifts all boats.

865
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:58,820
Speaker 2:  Okay, I have two thoughts on this and I'm curious what you think. One, this

866
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,260
Speaker 2:  makes me think we're still in this phase of, it's just

867
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:06,220
Speaker 2:  impossible to suit everybody that if you say the sort of buzzwords like

868
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,140
Speaker 2:  comprehensive privacy framework, everyone's like, oh cool, good idea. And

869
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,500
Speaker 2:  then as soon as you drill one level further down, it all falls apart because

870
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,420
Speaker 2:  everything is tradeoffs and nobody agrees. It also makes me think that the

871
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,940
Speaker 2:  one thing India gets wrong there in that the

872
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:24,140
Speaker 2:  only bipartisan thing in Congress in tech for years, and I

873
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,300
Speaker 2:  don't know if this is still true, I'm curious what you think, but you could

874
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,820
Speaker 2:  say children need to be protected online and everyone in Congress would agree

875
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,780
Speaker 2:  with you. There's like no other sentence in America that you can say that

876
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,820
Speaker 2:  everyone in Congress agrees with. But on that one, everybody agreed, and

877
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,540
Speaker 2:  it seems to me that's why there's been energy to do this because it

878
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,380
Speaker 2:  is an actually functional bipartisan thing and

879
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,060
Speaker 2:  it's small enough and narrow enough that you can maybe possibly do something

880
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,540
Speaker 2:  about it. Whereas if you say privacy online for everybody,

881
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:54,900
Speaker 2:  like that becomes the size of the universe and everything explodes. What

882
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,060
Speaker 2:  do you think? Like, am I, am I thinking about this the wrong way or is she

883
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,220
Speaker 2:  kind of maybe not giving it as much credit as it needs?

884
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:05,540
Speaker 15:  Yeah, I, when you talk to people you know who are digital rights advocates,

885
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:09,180
Speaker 15:  they are, they wanna shoot for the moon. you know, they want

886
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:13,260
Speaker 15:  what they see as the best solution. Now that solution is

887
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:17,060
Speaker 15:  actually viable. That's, you know, that's the real question actually. When

888
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,740
Speaker 15:  I was talking to Markie, I asked him specifically, I said, well why

889
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:24,740
Speaker 15:  COPPA 2.0? why not a, you know, a comprehensive data privacy framework?

890
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,460
Speaker 15:  And he basically said that it's so much more difficult and he doesn't imagine

891
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,260
Speaker 15:  it happening anytime soon.

892
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,780
Speaker 16:  The better target for now is to yes, worry about people

893
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,620
Speaker 16:  who are 25, 35, 45, 55, et cetera, but know that the

894
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,220
Speaker 16:  politics of getting that done are much more difficult in my opinion, in

895
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:46,020
Speaker 16:  this environment than protecting kids 16 and under

896
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:50,140
Speaker 16:  because that's always been a special category that

897
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,460
Speaker 16:  has been singled out in the courts

898
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,100
Speaker 16:  in political life for special protections while young

899
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,980
Speaker 16:  people's brains develop. So we want a comprehensive bill,

900
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,340
Speaker 16:  but my position is the least we can do this year is to

901
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,620
Speaker 16:  protect teenagers and children from the pernicious

902
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,140
Speaker 16:  strategies of the big tech companies.

903
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,540
Speaker 15:  I think that's the same sentiment from a lot of Democrats as well, especially

904
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:20,300
Speaker 15:  because President Biden, the White House has made it a priority

905
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,820
Speaker 15:  to do something on this front. In the past two state of the Union

906
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:27,780
Speaker 15:  addresses, Biden has explicitly called for child

907
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,340
Speaker 15:  protections.

908
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,820
Speaker 18:  We must finally hold social media companies accountable for

909
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,700
Speaker 18:  experimenting or doing running children for profit. There's

910
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,580
Speaker 18:  time to pass bipartisan legislation.

911
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:42,780
Speaker 15:  They see this as like you were saying something that Republicans and

912
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:46,740
Speaker 15:  Democrats can get behind and as something they can maybe do

913
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,740
Speaker 15:  before Biden's term is over.

914
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,060
Speaker 2:  So given all that, what do you think is the most likely outcome

915
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,980
Speaker 2:  this year we're about to head into a campaign season. So I think like prognosticating

916
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,460
Speaker 2:  basically anything after like six months from now I think is, is sort of

917
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,820
Speaker 2:  crazy. But like you said, there is real energy to do this right now and there

918
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,860
Speaker 2:  is a possibility of doing something this year. Do you think we're likely

919
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,700
Speaker 2:  to see one of these bills pass? Are we likely to see sort of an amalgam of

920
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,500
Speaker 2:  them come together? What's your sense,

921
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,540
Speaker 15:  Right. When we see lawmakers introduce these bills, they are

922
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,500
Speaker 15:  not going to be the same as they were introduced if they were to be

923
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:24,460
Speaker 15:  voted on on the floor at any, you know, that's just what happens. A lot

924
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,580
Speaker 15:  of bills being introduced is a senator putting out their

925
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,580
Speaker 15:  position publicly in language that they can then edit and work with

926
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,500
Speaker 15:  other people to get it done. When we see bills with a lot of energy behind

927
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,260
Speaker 15:  them, Marques is not being

928
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,500
Speaker 15:  talked about as much, which is why I wanted to talk to him specifically,

929
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,740
Speaker 15:  it's the Kids Online Safety Act, the one that has all these moderation

930
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,180
Speaker 15:  requirements that has a lot of people supporting it, it's

931
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,020
Speaker 15:  bipartisan in nature, it looks PR fairly viable. But the

932
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,060
Speaker 15:  funny thing about this is that Blackburn and Blumenthal have been having

933
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,780
Speaker 15:  all of these press conferences with parents and kids who support this bill

934
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,700
Speaker 15:  and support something being done. But at the same time you have all of

935
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,100
Speaker 15:  these civil liberties groups being like, this is too far. This could have

936
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,580
Speaker 15:  drastic consequences for everyone on the internet. And

937
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:16,940
Speaker 15:  over the last couple months, CSA has been edited

938
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:21,020
Speaker 15:  a bit to dampen down these concerns to make certain

939
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,300
Speaker 15:  language changes that would better protect everyone and the kids.

940
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,900
Speaker 15:  I imagine that is still ongoing. So when I look at

941
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,740
Speaker 15:  the timeline for this year, we are currently in June. I don't know

942
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,540
Speaker 15:  if listeners no, but Congress doesn't really follow

943
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,460
Speaker 15:  the Schoolhouse rock framework where things go through committee,

944
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,780
Speaker 15:  they go to the floor and everyone's so happy and they vote on it. That doesn't

945
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,580
Speaker 15:  want, that doesn't really happen anymore. Bills get attached to certain

946
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:52,580
Speaker 15:  must pass vehicles. So there's like a defense authorization

947
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:56,700
Speaker 15:  that basically authorizes all the money that we give to the defense department

948
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,300
Speaker 15:  and the military every year people love to stick things on that because

949
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:04,020
Speaker 15:  they have to pass that otherwise the military doesn't get funded. And then

950
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,460
Speaker 15:  there's also another option when it comes to appropriating money to make

951
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,060
Speaker 15:  sure all federal employees get paid, that all the federal

952
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,420
Speaker 15:  agencies get paid. And that's normally done in the fall. So I imagine

953
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,860
Speaker 15:  that if they want to get this done and they wanna get it done before the

954
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:22,380
Speaker 15:  end of the year, the best solution would be to spend

955
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,420
Speaker 15:  the next couple working periods editing down csa, maybe

956
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,300
Speaker 15:  implementing some COPPA 2.0 language, whatever that happens to

957
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,060
Speaker 15:  be, and then attaching it to some kind of

958
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,780
Speaker 15:  appropriation spill in the fall that gets included in, you know, all that

959
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:41,740
Speaker 15:  stuff. And that's how it gets passed. The final language just won't be clear

960
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:46,140
Speaker 15:  until it gets dropped in the fall. But I do imagine if they

961
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,540
Speaker 15:  want to get this done and if, if this is a priority for Biden, if this is

962
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:53,260
Speaker 15:  something he wants to run on, it's a kitchen table issue. We have seen Biden

963
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,660
Speaker 15:  focus on kitchen table issues. I'm sure listeners know the

964
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,340
Speaker 15:  Ticketmaster stuff that happened about junk fees recently. Biden

965
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,380
Speaker 15:  is looking at these issues that people see every day and they get

966
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:08,220
Speaker 15:  pissed about every day and they want that to be front of

967
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:12,060
Speaker 15:  mind to democratic voters and all voters technically. So

968
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,020
Speaker 15:  I see if this is a priority, it'll get done around that timeframe. So

969
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,540
Speaker 2:  The real question here is how do we get Taylor Swift really riled up about

970
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,020
Speaker 2:  children's privacy online? Cuz that's how we get this done.

971
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,820
Speaker 15:  Organize the swifties. Yeah. Oh my goodness. They

972
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,700
Speaker 2:  Can do anything they want,

973
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,180
Speaker 15:  You know, and that's, that's kind of the funny thing too because Taylor

974
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,020
Speaker 15:  Swift actually got Congress upset enough to do something about Ticketmaster,

975
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,740
Speaker 15:  like talked about a bunch of legislation and basically asked

976
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,620
Speaker 15:  the FTC or in the DOJ to investigate Ticketmaster for an

977
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:44,140
Speaker 15:  antitrust case to break it up. There's a lot of action there after Taylor

978
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:48,020
Speaker 15:  Swift said some stuff, I don't know who would

979
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,420
Speaker 15:  be the major figure here. The only person coming to mind is

980
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,460
Speaker 15:  I'm imagining like Blippy getting really upset about this. Sure. Perhaps

981
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,060
Speaker 15:  or Bluey, maybe there's a bluey episode where Bluey is like, kids

982
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:02,580
Speaker 15:  need to be protected. I don't know, I haven't seen Bluey, I just know kids

983
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,380
Speaker 15:  love it. That

984
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,660
Speaker 2:  Was a perfect bluey impression. That's all. That's all I'll tell you. So,

985
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,900
Speaker 2:  okay, so the last thing and then I'll let you go here is I wonder how

986
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,580
Speaker 2:  we're coming to think about this even like structurally. Cuz I think part

987
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,060
Speaker 2:  of the question is, is there a middle ground between these questions about

988
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,140
Speaker 2:  you know, encryption and free speech and privacy and protection,

989
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:24,580
Speaker 2:  which feels like it's this, that's also the debate about privacy

990
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:28,100
Speaker 2:  frameworks for everybody. It's a question of like does one side or the other

991
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,580
Speaker 2:  win or is there a middle ground? And then there's the question of like who

992
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,540
Speaker 2:  is responsible for this? And I think one of the things that's been interesting

993
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:39,140
Speaker 2:  to me about this round of bills is that some are still out there saying

994
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,980
Speaker 2:  the companies that run these platforms ought to be responsible and the way

995
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,460
Speaker 2:  that we held them responsible is by punishing them. And then there are other

996
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,740
Speaker 2:  people out there saying, you know, we need age verification system that works

997
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,980
Speaker 2:  across the whole internet and that's its own thing. But that's different

998
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,580
Speaker 2:  from saying like, YouTube's job is to fix this, right? Or the

999
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,820
Speaker 2:  questions about the online eraser button that's different from saying each

1000
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,380
Speaker 2:  individual platform has to just do it themselves, but that also introduces

1001
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,540
Speaker 2:  all other kinds of complexity. so like are we still in this kind of

1002
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:10,100
Speaker 2:  spaghetti throwing phase of trying to figure out how all this works or are

1003
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,020
Speaker 2:  we gonna land on sort of broader ideas about how

1004
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,420
Speaker 2:  to even go about making some of this legislation? Does that make sense?

1005
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:20,940
Speaker 15:  Yeah. I wanna point out the Ticketmaster thing again because

1006
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,260
Speaker 15:  how did Biden move something and have like this meeting at the White House

1007
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,940
Speaker 15:  with Ticketmaster Live Nation Airbnb and everyone celebrating this?

1008
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:33,220
Speaker 15:  Well it wasn't actually a lot that they agreed to. They

1009
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:36,820
Speaker 15:  basically agreed they don't get rid of junk fees, but they agreed

1010
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,820
Speaker 15:  to show them upfront nothing gets less expensive, you just aren't

1011
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:44,740
Speaker 15:  surprised by it later. So when we think about this, maybe the

1012
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:48,540
Speaker 15:  most practical and real scenario is that there's some kind of

1013
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,180
Speaker 15:  little change that happens. Maybe something updating Kapa a little bit,

1014
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:56,020
Speaker 15:  maybe just moving the age, I don't know what it could be. That could

1015
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,020
Speaker 15:  be the end game here. And I love that you brought up enforcement of this.

1016
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,380
Speaker 15:  How do you enforce something like this? Because that gets at another really

1017
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:07,980
Speaker 15:  consequential issue to all of this legislation frankly,

1018
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:11,260
Speaker 15:  because you look at a lot of these bills and the language of these bills,

1019
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:15,260
Speaker 15:  there's a Texas one for example that does some

1020
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,740
Speaker 15:  similar stuff like COSA where there is additional moderation requirements

1021
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,300
Speaker 15:  and kids can't see certain content. Everyone agrees that, you know,

1022
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,260
Speaker 15:  CS Sam gone should be eradicated from the internet. But

1023
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,260
Speaker 15:  in the law there is language explicitly calling

1024
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,700
Speaker 15:  grooming bad content that needs to not be

1025
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,860
Speaker 15:  online. And we've seen with the culture wars

1026
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:41,540
Speaker 15:  over the last however long grooming being

1027
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:45,100
Speaker 15:  used as an excuse to

1028
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,740
Speaker 15:  discriminate against queer people essentially. And

1029
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,140
Speaker 15:  I could see in interpretations of that, and the interpretation is really

1030
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,300
Speaker 15:  important here because the people who are enforcing this, it could be the

1031
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,180
Speaker 15:  FTC, it could be the D O J, but most of these bills

1032
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:04,500
Speaker 15:  allow state attorney generals to enforce this. So imagine

1033
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,540
Speaker 15:  a red state like Texas getting a law that has something about

1034
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,260
Speaker 15:  grooming and going after Facebook, Instagram,

1035
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,060
Speaker 15:  whoever for just having queer people on their

1036
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,540
Speaker 15:  platforms or maybe saying that kids cannot see this content.

1037
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,580
Speaker 15:  It just gets into all of these conversations when we look at like drag queen

1038
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:27,340
Speaker 15:  story hours, all of this stuff, those culture war elements that we see

1039
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:31,100
Speaker 15:  played out, book banning all of this, this is a

1040
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,740
Speaker 15:  way to bring all of that to the internet and for it to be enforced

1041
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,620
Speaker 15:  by red states. And that's what spooked people a lot.

1042
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,420
Speaker 2:  All right, well Congress is back in session. This is all moving really fast.

1043
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,740
Speaker 2:  I suspect we're gonna have more to talk about on this front very soon. But

1044
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,060
Speaker 2:  for now we need to take a break and then we are going to get into the Google

1045
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,820
Speaker 2:  Pixel Fold review and finally decide once and for all,

1046
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:56,420
Speaker 2:  whether flippable or foldable phones or neither or both

1047
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,260
Speaker 2:  or whatever are the future. We'll be right back

1048
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:07,180
Speaker 19:  This September. The code conference enters the new era. Join

1049
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,500
Speaker 19:  me Nili Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge and my two

1050
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:14,260
Speaker 19:  co-hosts, platformers Casey Newton and CNBC's Julia Bors.

1051
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,940
Speaker 19:  As we talk to the leaders making headlines in tech, business,

1052
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:22,100
Speaker 19:  politics, and the messy collision between them all, we'll dig

1053
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,060
Speaker 19:  deep into the topics that are shaping our world like AI streaming

1054
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,060
Speaker 19:  and the future of social media. And as always, with code no one will

1055
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:33,220
Speaker 19:  be saved from the hot seat. You can apply to attend the code

1056
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:36,860
Speaker 19:  conference@vvoxmedia.com slash code. That's

1057
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,340
Speaker 19:  vox media.com/code

1058
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:46,220
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. We've had two reviews on The Verge dot com the last couple

1059
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,180
Speaker 2:  of weeks that I think are a really big deal. The Motorola Razr Plus and

1060
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,940
Speaker 2:  the Google Pixel Fold. The Razr Plus is a flip phone and the Pixel Fold is

1061
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:57,820
Speaker 2:  a foldable phone and both have a chance to give us a

1062
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,700
Speaker 2:  new glimpse into the future of phones. Plus we're likely to see

1063
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,540
Speaker 2:  new flippables and foldables from Samsung this summer. So we've gotta figure

1064
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:09,020
Speaker 2:  out what's really the future here. What do we want from these devices? What

1065
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:12,140
Speaker 2:  are they supposed to be? How do they change the way that we think about our

1066
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,900
Speaker 2:  phones? The Verges, Allison Johnson and Dan Seifert have been using these

1067
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,580
Speaker 2:  phones for a while now, so I brought them both in and we're gonna get into

1068
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,060
Speaker 2:  all of it. Allison Hello.

1069
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:21,820
Speaker 20:  Hello

1070
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,820
Speaker 2:  Dan. Hello, hello. So we have a lot of things to talk about. I wanna talk

1071
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:29,300
Speaker 2:  about the Pixel Fold first and then I want to have a very long drawn out

1072
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,100
Speaker 2:  fight about flippable phones and foldable phones and which one is

1073
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,460
Speaker 2:  the future?

1074
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:34,460
Speaker 20:  So ready

1075
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:38,340
Speaker 2:  Because I have feelings that I, I feel more deeply every day

1076
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,340
Speaker 2:  and we're gonna talk about them.

1077
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:42,460
Speaker 21:  This is when hot foldable summer gets real sweaty. Oh yeah,

1078
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:45,380
Speaker 2:  It's exactly right. It's, it's about, it's about to get real fiery up in

1079
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:49,340
Speaker 2:  here. Let's start with the Pixel Fold because you both wrote stories about

1080
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:52,220
Speaker 2:  the Pixel Fold, you've been testing it for a while. This phone is a big deal,

1081
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,140
Speaker 2:  a lot of people have been talking about it and I think I wanna start with

1082
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:59,020
Speaker 2:  just like what it is like to figure out how to live life with a

1083
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,940
Speaker 2:  foldable phone. Because one of the things I got from both of the stories

1084
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,100
Speaker 2:  you guys have written and the stuff you've written about foldable phones

1085
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,820
Speaker 2:  over the last couple of years is that these are fundamentally sort of different

1086
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,260
Speaker 2:  kinds of devices. It's not like you like bought a phone with a bigger screen

1087
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:15,180
Speaker 2:  like you, you bought a different thing when you get a foldable device.

1088
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,540
Speaker 2:  So Allison, you go first. Dan is the, the foldable phone sicko here.

1089
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:22,500
Speaker 2:  So, we'll, we'll leave him alone for a second, but tell me about like what

1090
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,420
Speaker 2:  it's like to live with and review a foldable phone as opposed to some of

1091
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,380
Speaker 2:  the other sort of more standard devices you spend most of your time with.

1092
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:33,740
Speaker 20:  Yeah, the way I keep thinking of like, and this is sort of falling apart

1093
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,260
Speaker 20:  with the thing Motorola just announced, but like a flip style phone,

1094
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:41,460
Speaker 20:  it feels like a foldable plus. It's like a regular phone plus a smartwatch.

1095
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,300
Speaker 20:  The Galaxy Fold, the Pixel Fold, those are like

1096
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:49,180
Speaker 20:  a phone plus tablet. So that kind of dictates like

1097
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:53,580
Speaker 20:  what is enjoyable to do with it, what you get out of it. So really

1098
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:57,540
Speaker 20:  the Pixel Fold, it is a normal phone when you have it closed and it

1099
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:01,300
Speaker 20:  has that like lovely kind of normal phone

1100
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:04,940
Speaker 20:  shape as opposed to the the remote control that is the

1101
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,780
Speaker 20:  Galaxy Fold. So that's where you do your like quick

1102
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,620
Speaker 20:  texting notification stuff and then you

1103
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:16,580
Speaker 20:  open it up and in the case of the Pixel Fold you have kind of like a

1104
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:20,740
Speaker 20:  landscape oriented tablet out of the gate as opposed to the

1105
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,820
Speaker 20:  Galaxy folder, which is more portrait oriented. Okay. So,

1106
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,940
Speaker 20:  and that's where you, you multitask, you play a game, you watch your

1107
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,700
Speaker 20:  video, you set it up in the little laptop position and

1108
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:36,740
Speaker 20:  play Elmo so your kid will brush their teeth. All kinds of

1109
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,380
Speaker 20:  fun to be had.

1110
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,820
Speaker 2:  And thi this kind of gets at like the big sort of philosophical question.

1111
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,740
Speaker 2:  I feel like you're both reckoning within these stories, which is like, what

1112
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,380
Speaker 2:  are, what are these things for? And I feel like Dan, you kind of commit this

1113
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:51,300
Speaker 2:  from the point of view of like, I want do as much stuff on this as

1114
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:55,140
Speaker 2:  I can. I have more screen. Yeah, more stuff to do. Give me like a

1115
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,180
Speaker 2:  computer. I feel like you're, you're the person who is like, I use the iPad

1116
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,060
Speaker 2:  as my primary computing device. Right? And then Allison, I feel like you

1117
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,860
Speaker 2:  come at this as like the iPad is like a thing for my kid to hold and

1118
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:07,860
Speaker 2:  a thing for watching movies, right? Like it's, it's a bigger screen and that's

1119
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:11,380
Speaker 2:  like, it is sort of the tablet debate in a nutshell, right? And I feel like

1120
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:15,580
Speaker 2:  what a foldable phone should be is just like fundamentally the tablet debate

1121
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:19,300
Speaker 2:  again, right? And it feels like as we look at the Pixel Fold, which I think

1122
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,540
Speaker 2:  the, the sort of tldr of your review Allison was basically like good first

1123
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:25,820
Speaker 2:  generation device missing some stuff. And I want to get into all the stuff

1124
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:29,340
Speaker 2:  that's missing, but it does still feel like it has a very different idea

1125
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:33,220
Speaker 2:  about what a foldable phone like is supposed to do than something like

1126
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,100
Speaker 2:  the Samsung devices.

1127
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:38,340
Speaker 20:  Yeah, I Dan, I'm, I'm gonna steal your line, but you

1128
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:41,460
Speaker 20:  mentioned that like the Samsung phone just feels like a little computer

1129
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:44,180
Speaker 20:  that you have in your pocket. You can do like an incredible number of things

1130
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,140
Speaker 20:  on it. And what I ended up doing with it was

1131
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,940
Speaker 20:  sitting on the couch and when you're having that moment of like, oh I

1132
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,780
Speaker 20:  need to put this expense report together, I need to get up and get my

1133
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,340
Speaker 20:  computer. You're like ha, no I don't have to.

1134
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,020
Speaker 20:  I can run four apps on this thing and keep

1135
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,620
Speaker 20:  sitting here and and do that. And the kind of person who wants to do that

1136
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:12,060
Speaker 20:  is a Samsung foldable person. The Pixel Fold is more

1137
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,780
Speaker 20:  like, I just found it more approachable and

1138
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:19,620
Speaker 20:  it's, it's sort of like a friendlier, more like guardrail device

1139
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:23,660
Speaker 20:  where you can only run two apps side by side and split screen. So that

1140
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:27,420
Speaker 20:  just kind of like cuts down what you're gonna do with it,

1141
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:31,180
Speaker 20:  like productivity wise. But then there's, there's really useful stuff. Like

1142
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,820
Speaker 20:  I'm looking at Google Maps and I'm opening up a restaurant website

1143
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,940
Speaker 20:  in Chrome is right next to it. I don't have to like tab around

1144
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,860
Speaker 20:  it. It's good for stuff like that, but the gist of it that I kind of got

1145
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,780
Speaker 20:  is like this is nice. I enjoy being able to do these things.

1146
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,140
Speaker 20:  I do not care to spend $1,800 on it and

1147
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:54,460
Speaker 20:  carry around like a very heavy phone for these moments.

1148
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:58,620
Speaker 20:  Whereas with the Galaxy Fold it sort of felt like,

1149
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,580
Speaker 20:  wow, this is, this is a lot like I am getting a lot of

1150
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:04,180
Speaker 20:  value for $1,800.

1151
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:07,700
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah. Dan, I feel like the guardrails Allison is talking about sort

1152
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,460
Speaker 2:  of drove you slowly nuts over the course of testing this phone.

1153
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:13,500
Speaker 21:  Yeah, and I, I think Allison really hit it on the head with the price of

1154
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,420
Speaker 21:  the thing. Like the reason that I wanna do so much or try to get so much

1155
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:20,780
Speaker 21:  out of a device like this is one because it's always gonna be on my person,

1156
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,700
Speaker 21:  but the other is because I'm paying $1,800 or if I'm getting more storage

1157
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,460
Speaker 21:  like almost $2,000 for this phone, which is like a lot of money. So

1158
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:32,540
Speaker 21:  I wanna be able to use it as much as possible. And for me at

1159
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:35,900
Speaker 21:  least, if you're buying a folding phone like this that turns into a small

1160
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:39,780
Speaker 21:  tablet, the whole appeal is the big screen that fits in your

1161
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,020
Speaker 21:  pocket and all the things that you can do on that big screen. And I think

1162
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:46,740
Speaker 21:  it's like a lot of people are looking at the Pixel Fold and they say, oh

1163
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:50,500
Speaker 21:  that outside screen is more usable because it's more normal

1164
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:54,340
Speaker 21:  looking. It looks right because it's like normal proportions and things

1165
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:58,220
Speaker 21:  like that. And yes, I agree to all of those things, it's easier to use the

1166
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:02,140
Speaker 21:  outside screen and it's like more normal looking. But then

1167
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,620
Speaker 21:  when you open the phone and Allison kind of gets into this in her piece,

1168
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,980
Speaker 21:  the landscape orientation of the inside screen and the limitation

1169
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,940
Speaker 21:  with the software means that you could just do a whole lot less with the

1170
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,900
Speaker 21:  inside screen than you can on the Samsung. I think

1171
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,860
Speaker 21:  maybe an analogy that might make sense is the Pixel Fold feels like

1172
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,900
Speaker 21:  an iPad in terms of like the guardrails that are sent around you and like

1173
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,260
Speaker 21:  obviously Apple is like kind of changing this on its high end iPads but

1174
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,420
Speaker 21:  if you buy a base model iPad you're pretty limited with your multitasking

1175
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:35,020
Speaker 21:  abilities. You're limited with what you can do and things like that. It's

1176
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:35,100
Speaker 21:  a

1177
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,900
Speaker 2:  Big screen for watching things like that's what the base iPad is. Yeah,

1178
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,220
Speaker 21:  It's a big screen for watching things and the Pixel Fold is really great,

1179
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,420
Speaker 21:  a big screen for watching things. If you wanna watch video on it, you want

1180
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,540
Speaker 21:  to play games on it. I think Allison pointed out both of those things as

1181
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:50,340
Speaker 21:  really excellent use cases. The Z Fold is like a PC

1182
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,580
Speaker 21:  in like every single way. Sure that can be, it means it's

1183
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:58,540
Speaker 21:  like super powerful. You can run four apps at the same time. You can

1184
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:02,100
Speaker 21:  be in your banking app and pop open a calculator on top of it and run calculations

1185
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,780
Speaker 21:  without ever reliving your banking app. And you can do all these things

1186
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,540
Speaker 21:  and you can split the screen multiple ways and then you can save that setup.

1187
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,100
Speaker 21:  So you can always jump back to that setup quickly. And then you take out

1188
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,020
Speaker 21:  the yes pen and you can doodle things and you like the list goes on and

1189
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:16,340
Speaker 21:  on and on. You can literally plug it into an external screen and run a whole

1190
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,060
Speaker 21:  desktop environment off of it, turn it into a pc. And I think Allison is

1191
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,940
Speaker 21:  like very correct in saying that like the approachability of that

1192
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,820
Speaker 21:  is way lower than sure the

1193
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,300
Speaker 2:  Approachability

1194
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,260
Speaker 21:  Of the Pixel phone where it's like, oh I've got a thing that's twice the

1195
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,220
Speaker 21:  size of the screen that's on the outside and now I can run two apps side

1196
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:37,060
Speaker 21:  by side and I can watch a, a video on this bigger screen. And so

1197
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:40,660
Speaker 21:  like introducing people to this concept, I think the Pixel Fold to

1198
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:44,380
Speaker 21:  Alison's point does a really good job of that. But it just like, once you

1199
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,700
Speaker 21:  get there and once you figure it out, it doesn't take long to be like, oh

1200
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,860
Speaker 21:  I wanted to do something else or oh, I could like make more use of this

1201
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,900
Speaker 21:  than it's letting me do. And that's the same problem that like everyone's

1202
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:56,300
Speaker 21:  had with the iPad for forever is like, I wanna do more with this and the

1203
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:57,460
Speaker 21:  software's not letting me well and

1204
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:01,460
Speaker 2:  It's $1,800 not to keep putting a fine point on

1205
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:04,740
Speaker 2:  this, but like I would be very into the idea of like, let's have sort of

1206
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:08,700
Speaker 2:  a sliding scale of power of these devices and like

1207
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,180
Speaker 2:  the, the iPad is actually a good example, right? You can get the souped up

1208
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:16,220
Speaker 2:  ultra bonkers 12.9 inch iPad Pro and it will cost you

1209
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:19,260
Speaker 2:  $1 million and you, you essentially know what you're getting, right? Like

1210
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:23,140
Speaker 2:  you, you get the iPad Pro, you get the magic keyboard, you get the Apple

1211
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:27,060
Speaker 2:  pencil and it costs as much as a car and that, but like you

1212
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,060
Speaker 2:  know what you're getting. And then on the flip side you can spend $329 and

1213
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,660
Speaker 2:  get an iPad and I feel like Samsung is doing the iPad Pro thing and Google

1214
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,420
Speaker 2:  is doing the iPad base model thing, but Google

1215
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,860
Speaker 2:  forgot to make it cheaper. Yeah. And I just feel like that to me is where

1216
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:44,700
Speaker 2:  the kind of value prop here falls apart is Google is like here's less phone

1217
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,900
Speaker 2:  for the same money and I have a hard time with that.

1218
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:52,140
Speaker 20:  Right? Yeah. And something else that just kind of bothers me is the

1219
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,060
Speaker 20:  durability is just a question mark. It's I p x

1220
01:11:56,110 --> 01:12:00,060
Speaker 20:  eight rated, so it's like waterproof to like full

1221
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,940
Speaker 20:  water immersion, which is really good, but it is a first

1222
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,820
Speaker 20:  gen product, you know repairs, you can't just waltz it into any

1223
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,420
Speaker 20:  repair shop on the street. Not that that's a great idea anyway,

1224
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:15,380
Speaker 20:  but yeah, there's more of a process, there's more cost involved. I got,

1225
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:18,900
Speaker 20:  I have a little tiny scratch on the screen protector

1226
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:22,860
Speaker 20:  inside my review unit and I was, I didn't baby it but I didn't like

1227
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,940
Speaker 20:  put it, you know, next to my car keys. Right. With

1228
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:30,540
Speaker 20:  this screen unfolded, what does that look like after a year of using it?

1229
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:34,660
Speaker 20:  It's when you come back to like keep coming back to $1,800,

1230
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,340
Speaker 20:  you're like well that that doesn't seem great.

1231
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:41,420
Speaker 2:  Yeah, so the Pixel Fold I would say on the, so like Samsung has had four

1232
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,740
Speaker 2:  tries at this, right? We think the the next one is coming in August or in

1233
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:48,620
Speaker 2:  July or August sometime this summer. Where on that history

1234
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:51,660
Speaker 2:  would you put the Pixel Fold because it seems to be clearly better than the

1235
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:55,420
Speaker 2:  first Galaxy Fold, which was a mess. Yeah. Hardware wise.

1236
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:55,780
Speaker 2:  Oh

1237
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:56,020
Speaker 21:  Totally.

1238
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,580
Speaker 2:  Is it like the Z Fold, the Fold two, the Fold three, the Fold four? Like

1239
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,900
Speaker 2:  where would we put the Pixel Fold?

1240
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,340
Speaker 21:  I would put it at 2.5 or three. Okay. Like

1241
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:09,060
Speaker 21:  there's like it's, it's, it's a much better first generation start

1242
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,660
Speaker 21:  than Samsung had for very obvious reasons.

1243
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,100
Speaker 2:  It doesn't instantly break as soon as you start using it,

1244
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,500
Speaker 21:  It doesn't instantly break. You don't, it doesn't look, you don't look at

1245
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,980
Speaker 21:  it wrong in it like you know, the screen explodes but Samsung fixed that

1246
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:24,180
Speaker 21:  pretty quickly. But the Z Fold two, which was the next generation, the

1247
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,260
Speaker 21:  the screen hinge was made much better. They started introducing some things

1248
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:30,420
Speaker 21:  to mitigate dust and water resistance and things like that. Google's already

1249
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:34,060
Speaker 21:  starting at that point so they have the same as Allison mentioned the I

1250
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,340
Speaker 21:  P X eight rating as Samsung, which means you can get it wet, you can even

1251
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:41,300
Speaker 21:  submerge it, which is kind of fascinating for a phone that folds with moving

1252
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:45,060
Speaker 21:  parts and everything and and it has that level of water resistance and the,

1253
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:49,020
Speaker 21:  the hinge is very smooth, it's strong enough to hold the phone open like

1254
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,940
Speaker 21:  Allison mentioned in like a laptop mode if you wanna prop it up to to watch

1255
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:56,540
Speaker 21:  a video or something like that. Which Samsung didn't have on its first generation

1256
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:00,300
Speaker 21:  things. So it's clear that Google has been paying attention to what

1257
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:03,820
Speaker 21:  Samsung was doing and learning from it and, and that's great love to see

1258
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:07,180
Speaker 21:  it. There are areas though, even in the hardware I mean we talked a lot

1259
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,740
Speaker 21:  about the software experience but even in the hardware experience where

1260
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:13,790
Speaker 21:  Samsung is just kind of ahead just because it's had so many

1261
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:17,750
Speaker 21:  years to iterate on this idea, one of them is the screens. Samsung's screens

1262
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:21,350
Speaker 21:  are brighter. Like they're just brighter. Like there's, I don't know what

1263
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:25,110
Speaker 21:  else to put it and it feels like the Google screens are generation or two

1264
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,910
Speaker 21:  behind because if you look at Samsung's history, the Z Fold three to the

1265
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:32,230
Speaker 21:  Z Fold four, the big change was they made the screens brighter. So it's

1266
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:34,070
Speaker 21:  like oh this feels like the Z Fold three screens.

1267
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:38,150
Speaker 2:  Is Google just buying parts from Samsung from a year ago? Is that basically

1268
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:38,790
Speaker 2:  what's happening here?

1269
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:41,950
Speaker 21:  I mean it could be The Pixel folds been in development for a long time,

1270
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:44,830
Speaker 21:  they've been reporting rumors on this for like two years. Yeah. I mean these

1271
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:48,350
Speaker 21:  things take forever. And so it could be that like the panels that they secured

1272
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:52,190
Speaker 21:  were at the Z Fold three generation level or whatever. Or maybe Samsung

1273
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:55,190
Speaker 21:  is just kind of like hoarding the good stuff for itself, which would not

1274
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,910
Speaker 21:  be surprise anybody. Right. The other thing and and Allison made quite a

1275
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:02,350
Speaker 21:  few points about this in her review, the Pixel Fold is heavier than the

1276
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:06,270
Speaker 21:  Z Fold and on paper it doesn't sound like a lot, it's 20 grams

1277
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:10,430
Speaker 21:  but in use you notice it and you notice it every time you pick up the phone

1278
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:13,710
Speaker 21:  or put it in your pocket or put it in your bag or whatever. Older Z Fold

1279
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:17,390
Speaker 21:  phones were heavier, Samsung made them lighter over time. I believe the

1280
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,990
Speaker 21:  Z Fold five specks have now leaked and it looks like it's gonna be 10 grams

1281
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:24,310
Speaker 21:  lighter than the Z Fold four. so like Samsung's been doing these like very

1282
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:28,350
Speaker 21:  small iterative chipping away at these problems and making

1283
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:31,190
Speaker 21:  it a better overall experience that Google just hasn't been able to catch

1284
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:34,750
Speaker 21:  up with because it is it's first generation and I think Google will get

1285
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,510
Speaker 21:  there and if they start off this far ahead like at two and a half

1286
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:42,390
Speaker 21:  generations or three generations in and in a year or two if they stick at

1287
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:46,150
Speaker 21:  it they can very well keep up or surpass Samsung because

1288
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:49,790
Speaker 21:  Samsung's been moving very slow with the iteration on the, the Fold devices.

1289
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:53,190
Speaker 21:  So that's kind of where I'm, I'm placing it, it's a couple generations behind

1290
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:55,470
Speaker 21:  where it is. It's still a very strong start.

1291
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:58,350
Speaker 2:  Okay. Allison, let's talk about the weight thing cuz that was the thing in

1292
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:02,190
Speaker 2:  your review I think of, of all of the imperfections of the

1293
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:05,310
Speaker 2:  Pixel Fold, that was the thing that bummed me out the most because what you

1294
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:09,030
Speaker 2:  said was, it was so heavy that you found yourself not

1295
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:12,670
Speaker 2:  wanting to use it in one hand and so you end up sort of sitting down and

1296
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:16,510
Speaker 2:  opening the screen. And to me the thing that has been compelling all along

1297
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:20,390
Speaker 2:  about the Pixel Fold is it has a usable outside screen,

1298
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:24,510
Speaker 2:  not like the TV remote like the Fold is like we were talking about. But it

1299
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:27,870
Speaker 2:  almost sounds like you found yourself not wanting to use that much better

1300
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:31,590
Speaker 2:  outside screen just because of the actual physical size of the thing,

1301
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,230
Speaker 2:  which to me sort of kills the whole appeal. Was it as bad as it sounds?

1302
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:39,550
Speaker 20:  Yeah, I, I don't wanna make too much of it. It's like it'll,

1303
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:43,150
Speaker 20:  it'll bother people on different levels. I think maybe I'm more

1304
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:47,390
Speaker 20:  sensitive to a heavy phone but you know, I just found myself

1305
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:50,670
Speaker 20:  again and again, like you have it in one hand sitting on the couch

1306
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:54,910
Speaker 20:  and the way it just kind of weighs down on your pinky finger. I was like,

1307
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:57,550
Speaker 20:  I, I don't like this, I have to keep moving my hand.

1308
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:00,030
Speaker 2:  There's definitely that thing where you find yourself sort of stretching

1309
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:01,590
Speaker 2:  your hand every couple of minutes. Yeah you

1310
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,310
Speaker 21:  Get the divot in between your knuckles. Yeah.

1311
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:07,550
Speaker 20:  You're like ugh is that little divot there from using this bone

1312
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:11,140
Speaker 20:  too much it and it feels more balanced like you're

1313
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,860
Speaker 20:  distributing the weight more when you open it up. So I ended up doing that

1314
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:18,380
Speaker 20:  more in instances where I didn't really need the big screen.

1315
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:22,380
Speaker 20:  Yeah, I, I think I would like a phone I could use more

1316
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:26,180
Speaker 20:  comfortably, you know, with this screen folded and I feel like I'm asking

1317
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,420
Speaker 20:  for a lot. Like I don't wanna, you know, be like oh a phone

1318
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:34,180
Speaker 20:  that folds in half, it's too heavy and like this is an

1319
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:38,100
Speaker 20:  accomplishment and it's right. It's a wonderful device to use

1320
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:42,100
Speaker 20:  in a lot of ways. For me personally for $1,800 I

1321
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:46,060
Speaker 20:  don't wanna feel like my phone is too heavy when I'm using it for

1322
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:47,780
Speaker 20:  five or 10 minutes at a time.

1323
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:50,780
Speaker 2:  Well and I think this comes back to like Dan what you're talking about with

1324
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:54,420
Speaker 2:  this sort of philosophy of it all right? Because I think the way you think

1325
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:58,300
Speaker 2:  about it would be that the goal is to kind of get to the inside

1326
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,900
Speaker 2:  screen as much as possible because that's why you bought this thing, that's

1327
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:04,660
Speaker 2:  what it's for. Did the size of kind of holding the thing

1328
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,100
Speaker 2:  bother you in the same way or are you just like yeah whatever, just let me

1329
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,380
Speaker 2:  open up the thing, who cares?

1330
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,860
Speaker 21:  It absolutely did. I think there's like a couple of factors with it. One

1331
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:16,620
Speaker 21:  the weight, which I noticed right away. Two just kind of like if you look

1332
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,700
Speaker 21:  at the really nitty gritty design differences, the Pixel Fold

1333
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:23,660
Speaker 21:  folds flat closed which is really awesome. There's no gap between the halves,

1334
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:27,500
Speaker 21:  which Samsung hasn't done yet. We expect the Z Fold five will based on the

1335
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,260
Speaker 21:  leak so far. But for now the Z Fold four has a little gap. It's

1336
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:34,500
Speaker 21:  also thicker when it's closed. The z the Pixel Fold is nice and thin when

1337
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:38,260
Speaker 21:  it's closed, but like the bottom bevel or edge of the Pixel Fold is

1338
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:42,380
Speaker 21:  not smooth and flat and that kinda like hurts the comfort when you're

1339
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,860
Speaker 21:  holding it on your pinky and things like that. The weight is noticeably

1340
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:49,140
Speaker 21:  different. The other difference is the Pixel Fold has this like kind of

1341
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:52,780
Speaker 21:  noticeable bezel around the screen. So it's footprint is larger,

1342
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:55,940
Speaker 21:  which means that it's more that you have to like deal with and wrangle in

1343
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,700
Speaker 21:  your hands, especially when it's open. That's, that's mostly noticeable

1344
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:02,220
Speaker 21:  when it's open. And like we talked about landscape versus portrait

1345
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,740
Speaker 21:  orientation, you end up turning the Pixel Fold into portrait

1346
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:08,940
Speaker 21:  orientation a lot in order to get the best experience because

1347
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:13,260
Speaker 21:  Android apps don't expect you to be using a landscape screen. So when they

1348
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:16,820
Speaker 21:  open on the Pixel Fold, a lot of them will open with black bars on the side

1349
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,460
Speaker 21:  or they will stretch weirdly across the screen because it's like a landscape

1350
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:23,980
Speaker 21:  screen that it's trying to switch to. But if you rotate at 90 degrees, the

1351
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:27,620
Speaker 21:  app kind of knows what to do. It fills the screen vast majority of the time

1352
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,540
Speaker 21:  and it just looks more normal. The, the layout makes more sense. It's a

1353
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,780
Speaker 21:  vertically scrolling app which is like the vast majority of the of apps

1354
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,860
Speaker 21:  that we use today have that kind of vertical scrolling interaction. So portrait

1355
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,860
Speaker 21:  kind of makes sense for a lot of things and when you turn the Pixel Fold

1356
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:44,380
Speaker 21:  to portrait, not only is that like annoying to do all day long, it's like

1357
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:48,300
Speaker 21:  a big platter that you're holding, whereas the Z Fold is much more comfortable

1358
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:51,180
Speaker 21:  to hold in that orientation and much easier to hold in that orientation

1359
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:54,140
Speaker 21:  just because it's a little bit more compact even though they both have the

1360
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,500
Speaker 21:  exact same size screen on the inside.

1361
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,460
Speaker 2:  So did you get to the point where you're using it where you kind of, you

1362
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:01,260
Speaker 2:  hold the phone in one hand normally and it's like holding a phone and then

1363
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:04,540
Speaker 2:  as you're opening it you're like also kind of turning it 90 degrees in your

1364
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,900
Speaker 2:  hand? I do that all the time. It's just like the natural way of Yeah. Interacting

1365
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:08,660
Speaker 2:  with it now. Yeah

1366
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:11,940
Speaker 21:  Like I I mean I would like basically I would open it, I would unlock it

1367
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:15,020
Speaker 21:  with the fingerprint scanner or whatever. I would open the app I want to

1368
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:18,140
Speaker 21:  use and then I would rotate the phone and hold it and then try and like

1369
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:21,500
Speaker 21:  prop it up on my finger and like that's how I used it the vast majority

1370
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:24,980
Speaker 21:  of the time. And then occasionally I'd wanna split screen like Alison mentioned,

1371
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:29,020
Speaker 21:  put maps next to a browser, whatever. Or I'd, if I was watching a video

1372
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,660
Speaker 21:  I'd rotate it back to landscape. But the majority of my use case is in portrait

1373
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,860
Speaker 21:  orientation because that's what most apps are.

1374
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:38,540
Speaker 2:  Allison. Does that match your use? Like as you find yourself just sort of

1375
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,620
Speaker 2:  using it day to day? Is that, is that what you're doing too?

1376
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,820
Speaker 20:  Well I wasn't as smart, I didn't like rotate it as much but

1377
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:48,420
Speaker 20:  yeah when I would open it up I would find myself, you get the like black

1378
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:52,380
Speaker 20:  bars on either side of Instagram or whatever, it just made me

1379
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:56,100
Speaker 20:  wanna open more apps just to put something there. Oh

1380
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:56,900
Speaker 20:  interesting. Which I was

1381
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,100
Speaker 2:  Like, so you end up just like side by sighting apps just because it yeah

1382
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,340
Speaker 2:  like that's what looks better.

1383
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:04,980
Speaker 20:  Yeah I'm like well I might, as I've got this space I might as well open

1384
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:08,780
Speaker 20:  something else and then I'm sort of like scrolling two things at once and

1385
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,020
Speaker 20:  I don't know, I think my mindset is just sort of, I wanna be like

1386
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:17,260
Speaker 20:  a little less engaged with my phone overall or like feel like I'm

1387
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:20,580
Speaker 20:  just more in control and

1388
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:24,740
Speaker 20:  yeah, just in that kind of scenario with a Pixel Fold I was like this is,

1389
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:26,700
Speaker 20:  I do not need more phone here.

1390
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,900
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's very fair. The last thing we should talk about before we get

1391
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,740
Speaker 2:  to Flip versus Fold and all of my strong feelings, y'all can leave for that

1392
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,220
Speaker 2:  part. I'm just gonna yell into the microphone for about 45 minutes but we

1393
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:40,180
Speaker 2:  should talk a little bit about Android cuz I think my general stance on

1394
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:44,260
Speaker 2:  phones has always been that Samsung goes about 250%

1395
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,540
Speaker 2:  too far with its stuff. It just adds a lot of things you don't need and one

1396
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:50,700
Speaker 2:  of the reasons I have always defaulted to telling people to buy pixels is

1397
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:54,420
Speaker 2:  that Google's version of Android is just still the best one out there.

1398
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:57,780
Speaker 2:  That seems less true here. It seems like the Pixel Fold

1399
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:02,300
Speaker 2:  has some good ideas about larger screens and foldable devices. Android seems

1400
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:05,340
Speaker 2:  to have gotten a lot better, Google's own apps work better, but it seems

1401
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:09,020
Speaker 2:  like both of you are kind of, of the opinion that all the crap Samsung

1402
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:13,060
Speaker 2:  has added is actually mostly a good thing in the actual Android

1403
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,020
Speaker 2:  has some catching up to do on how foldables work. Is

1404
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:18,740
Speaker 2:  that Allison, is that that your take?

1405
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:23,340
Speaker 20:  Yeah, it's, there's kind of a maximal list like ethos

1406
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,580
Speaker 20:  to the, to the folding phone and that vibes really well

1407
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,620
Speaker 20:  with Samsung I think. And that's where it makes sense is

1408
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:33,380
Speaker 2:  Samsung never met a feature it doesn't want to shift. Yeah, right.

1409
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,540
Speaker 21:  The full Samsung experience can only be had on a folding phone and

1410
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,820
Speaker 21:  and they're gonna give you everything.

1411
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:41,380
Speaker 20:  It's the ultimate Samsung experience.

1412
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:45,220
Speaker 2:  Yeah, but is Google catching up there do you think? Because again, like we

1413
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,220
Speaker 2:  were talking about with the sort of slightly more guardrail, less chaotic

1414
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,780
Speaker 2:  way, it does seem like there's a middle ground there that I believe in Google

1415
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,700
Speaker 2:  for and it seems like at least with like the maps and some of the other Google

1416
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:59,660
Speaker 2:  apps, it's pushing in a good direction. It just kind of needs, I guess the

1417
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:03,340
Speaker 2:  rest of I Android to catch up, which is the same story of a decade of larger

1418
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:06,860
Speaker 2:  screen devices. But is there, does it feel like progress now? At least

1419
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:11,380
Speaker 20:  It does. Yeah. And there's there's a lot. Yeah the work they put

1420
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:15,260
Speaker 20:  into optimizing a lot of the Google apps for

1421
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,860
Speaker 20:  the folding phone is really good. I mean, I, you know, I opened up Google

1422
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:22,580
Speaker 20:  Meet, which we all love and you, you Fold the phone and

1423
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,900
Speaker 20:  the content just kind of flows into the right place in your, in

1424
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:30,780
Speaker 20:  your meeting. Like that is great. I think what they're approaching is,

1425
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:35,100
Speaker 20:  is a folding device that a lot of people can come to and pick up

1426
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:39,220
Speaker 20:  and just and feel like welcome and I think

1427
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,620
Speaker 20:  I'm gonna really like that in a few generations when maybe

1428
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:47,380
Speaker 20:  it's less expensive and doesn't weigh as much as a

1429
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:47,580
Speaker 20:  break.

1430
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:51,660
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that is very fair. Dan, you even more than Allison

1431
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:53,900
Speaker 2:  seem to appreciate the full Samsung

1432
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:58,460
Speaker 21:  In this context. Yes. And like I don't appreciate experiencing the full

1433
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:02,020
Speaker 21:  Samsung all the time and when I say the full Samsung I mean like you are

1434
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:05,020
Speaker 21:  running the three apps and then you put the popup app up and then you pull

1435
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:07,180
Speaker 21:  out your si like I don't recommend people do

1436
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,700
Speaker 2:  That and then Bixby shows up and is like, do you want help with your phone?

1437
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:10,660
Speaker 2:  It's good times. Yeah.

1438
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:14,900
Speaker 21:  What I, what I appreciate is the ability to do that if I so want it. If

1439
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,940
Speaker 21:  I don't want go the full Samsung, maybe I want the half Samsung or like

1440
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:21,060
Speaker 21:  the three quarter Samsung for whatever job I need to do and like the Pixel

1441
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:24,060
Speaker 21:  just doesn't let you get there because they, they put those guardrails in

1442
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:27,700
Speaker 21:  place that means that you can only do certain things. Like one thing that

1443
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:31,460
Speaker 21:  kind of blew my mind was like no Pixel phone allows you to plug into an

1444
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:35,220
Speaker 21:  external display. You can't mirror the screen, you can't put your video

1445
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,980
Speaker 21:  on a bigger screen or whatever over A U S B C cable rumors are saying that

1446
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:42,180
Speaker 21:  like the Pixel eight line will change that, but we're not there yet. So

1447
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:45,620
Speaker 21:  those are like kind of like small productivity things, but they all add

1448
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,700
Speaker 21:  up and like they, they make a difference when you're thinking of like I

1449
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:52,420
Speaker 21:  could live with a Z Fold four is my only computer, I couldn't

1450
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,860
Speaker 21:  really get there with a Pixel Fold at least for my needs and my desires.

1451
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,900
Speaker 21:  And again, $1,800, that is like a big ask

1452
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:04,220
Speaker 21:  for something that like only does certain things and doesn't do everything

1453
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,220
Speaker 21:  I wanna do with it. Yeah.

1454
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,700
Speaker 2:  I, I just, I really am so I'm so much more hung up on the price with this

1455
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:12,340
Speaker 2:  device than most because just at this price it is such a

1456
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:16,020
Speaker 2:  self-selecting thing for people who are

1457
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:20,180
Speaker 2:  going to want to do a lot more stuff with this device. Like no one

1458
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:24,060
Speaker 2:  is buying it to just like put it in a case and look

1459
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,820
Speaker 2:  at TikTok like if that's what you're buying this for, you're, you're insane.

1460
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:30,100
Speaker 2:  Like don't buy that in this phone. These people are going to want to do more

1461
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:33,220
Speaker 2:  stuff and I think Google is trying to build a phone that seems like it's

1462
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:35,940
Speaker 2:  gonna be way more compelling. Like you were saying Allison like in three

1463
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:39,500
Speaker 2:  years at half the price. Whereas Samsung I feel like might

1464
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,700
Speaker 2:  continue to be able to make an interesting case for a device that costs this

1465
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,860
Speaker 2:  much just because of all the stuff that it can do for you. And I like, I

1466
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,940
Speaker 2:  kind of hope they both stay on that path because they'll end up in really

1467
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:52,500
Speaker 2:  different really interesting places in Foldables.

1468
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:56,420
Speaker 20:  Yeah, I think like software wise the Pixel Fold is the kind of phone I would

1469
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:59,780
Speaker 20:  recommend to a lot of people. Like if my dad, you know, I think he would

1470
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,580
Speaker 20:  get a lot out of using all those apps on the big screen but there's, there's

1471
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:07,420
Speaker 20:  just no way in hell I'm gonna town to buy an $1,800 phone. Right.

1472
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:08,380
Speaker 20:  So someday.

1473
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,660
Speaker 2:  All right, let's switch gears just for a minute and talk flip phones because

1474
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:16,380
Speaker 2:  the other phone you just reviewed Allison is the Motorola Razr Plus, which

1475
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,580
Speaker 2:  is a phone. I have been eagerly looking forward to your review for a very

1476
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:23,500
Speaker 2:  long time and it seems like it's great. It's like the perfect flip phone

1477
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:27,500
Speaker 2:  does not exist yet, but we're getting much closer

1478
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:31,340
Speaker 2:  very quickly. The price is good, the phone is good. It seems like the, the

1479
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,500
Speaker 2:  Razr Plus is like, it's a, it's a good thing, right?

1480
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:37,940
Speaker 20:  Yeah, yeah. And I was kind of waiting for it to betray me a

1481
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:41,220
Speaker 20:  little bit cuz everything did seem so promising.

1482
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,820
Speaker 20:  But yeah, it, it pretty much delivers, the really notable

1483
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:49,140
Speaker 20:  thing of course is the outer screen is that big

1484
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:52,660
Speaker 20:  3.6 inch, like big, relatively speaking right?

1485
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:56,580
Speaker 20:  Small but big. It's just a full kind of phone on its own.

1486
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,220
Speaker 20:  You can run any app you want, like speaking of

1487
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:04,020
Speaker 20:  guardrails, Motorola is like go for it. You have

1488
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:07,900
Speaker 20:  to tap on a little tiny text box that says like, this

1489
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:11,780
Speaker 20:  app might not look great on this little tiny screen but you can do it.

1490
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,860
Speaker 20:  It's just like you gotta live with your choices there.

1491
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:18,220
Speaker 2:  I always like to think that if I call that the the hey idiot popup

1492
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:19,140
Speaker 20:  Yeah.

1493
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:22,380
Speaker 2:  Where they can't say like, you're stupid and this is a bad idea, but they're

1494
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,340
Speaker 2:  just like, this is stupid, don't do this. Yeah,

1495
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:25,460
Speaker 20:  Please don't, but

1496
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:27,780
Speaker 2:  Okay. And and Allison's just here being like whatever.

1497
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:31,420
Speaker 20:  Yeah, I'm like, you don't tell me how to live my life Motorola.

1498
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,140
Speaker 2:  But I think, and you said this with the foldable phone too, that one of the

1499
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:39,220
Speaker 2:  things that you like about this new kind of device is like control over

1500
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:43,220
Speaker 2:  your experience with devices and to me that's the whole appeal of flip phones,

1501
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:47,060
Speaker 2:  right? Is there is there's something real about this idea that

1502
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:50,540
Speaker 2:  like I can close my phone and even on the smaller screen you can sort of

1503
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,180
Speaker 2:  tap at a text message. I loved the screenshot that you had that it was the

1504
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:57,180
Speaker 2:  keyboard takes up the whole screen on the ERs display really the whole screen,

1505
01:27:57,350 --> 01:28:00,900
Speaker 2:  which is like a little bit ridiculous but also kind of

1506
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:03,860
Speaker 2:  works and it works just well enough that I'm gonna like respond to my text

1507
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:06,900
Speaker 2:  message and then put my phone down and move on as opposed to just like swiping

1508
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:09,340
Speaker 2:  back to the home screen. Yeah. And then getting lost in Instagram for three

1509
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:13,100
Speaker 2:  and a half hours. But it, it does feel like, I think running full apps

1510
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:16,340
Speaker 2:  on your outer screen is insane and we, no one should be allowed to do that

1511
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,980
Speaker 2:  and you should be thrown in prison for doing that. But the idea of having

1512
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:23,900
Speaker 2:  this sort of not quite phone, like you said, it's a smartwatch on the outside

1513
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,900
Speaker 2:  and a and a smartphone on the inside that really works for me. Dan,

1514
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:30,340
Speaker 2:  I feel like you and I are probably very different on this, given that you

1515
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,780
Speaker 2:  just spent the whole weekend with your phone plugged into an external monitor.

1516
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:37,660
Speaker 2:  What, what's your, how do you feel about flip phones as a, as a

1517
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:38,020
Speaker 2:  concern?

1518
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:40,620
Speaker 21:  I, I think they're really cool. I don't know if they're the right device

1519
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:44,020
Speaker 21:  for me, if we're talking just like flip phones versus foldables or whatever,

1520
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,980
Speaker 21:  I kind of will lean towards the one that gives me the, the biggest screen

1521
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:51,100
Speaker 21:  possible in my pocket. But I think to Allison's point, the

1522
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:54,820
Speaker 21:  Razr is the first flip phone that's actually intrigued me. I

1523
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:58,220
Speaker 21:  think I reviewed one of the Z flip models one of the earlier generations

1524
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,580
Speaker 21:  and that one really annoyed me because the outside screen was so useless

1525
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,540
Speaker 21:  and then in order to do anything with the phone you had to open it up and

1526
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:09,380
Speaker 21:  it requires two hands to open it and like then it's just a, you

1527
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:12,780
Speaker 21:  know, S 20 or S 21 at the time once you open it and then there was not,

1528
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:16,660
Speaker 21:  there's no novel novelty about that. Whereas the Razr to Allison's point,

1529
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,820
Speaker 21:  you can do things on that outside screen and you can be more intentional

1530
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:23,220
Speaker 21:  with your actions on the phone and actually respond to the message or check

1531
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,740
Speaker 21:  you know, the upcoming directions or skip a track on your music or whatever

1532
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:30,140
Speaker 21:  it is that you're doing really quickly without getting like sucked into

1533
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:34,220
Speaker 21:  whatever distraction might be there. If you're using the full-size screen

1534
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,980
Speaker 21:  all the time, I end up picking my phone with a specific reason,

1535
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:42,980
Speaker 21:  like I need to like add something to our shopping list or look up the price

1536
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:45,620
Speaker 21:  of something or whatever and I pick it up and I get distracted by notification

1537
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,660
Speaker 21:  and then like five minutes later I'm like standing there like not remembering

1538
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:52,020
Speaker 21:  what I wanted to do on my phone. I feel like that's less likely to happen

1539
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:56,180
Speaker 21:  if you have to be so intentional to open up the phone but you

1540
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:59,580
Speaker 21:  can still, you know, have a useful device that's like the level of a smartwatch

1541
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,540
Speaker 21:  in capability on the outside. And I think that the Razr is really

1542
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:07,180
Speaker 21:  interesting on that front. It's also like it's about a thousand dollars,

1543
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:11,180
Speaker 21:  which is premium and expensive but not $2,000. So it's much

1544
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:14,580
Speaker 21:  more approachable. I think it makes a lot of sense for a lot of people at

1545
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:18,220
Speaker 21:  that level, you know, to be, people already spend that much on most phones

1546
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:22,260
Speaker 21:  now, so it's not like a reach to to get this like more

1547
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:26,380
Speaker 21:  intentional compact experience and actually still be useful

1548
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,180
Speaker 21:  and still be usable.

1549
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:31,100
Speaker 2:  Totally. Yeah. And I also Allison, I appreciate that you keep banging the

1550
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:35,060
Speaker 2:  drum in all of these reviews that the fact that you can put it down

1551
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:38,900
Speaker 2:  on a table, flip the screen up and either like look at something or

1552
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,500
Speaker 2:  use it as a camera. And this is true of foldables and flippables, but the

1553
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:46,180
Speaker 2:  thing where it's like halfway its own kickstand is awesome and it sounds

1554
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:50,100
Speaker 2:  so stupid and so small, especially for a device that expensive. But it's

1555
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:53,900
Speaker 2:  great and I love it and I appreciate that you do too.

1556
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,380
Speaker 20:  I mean I, I take a lot of pictures of my child, like all of us do.

1557
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,500
Speaker 2:  I also take a lot of pictures of your child. Yeah.

1558
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:06,140
Speaker 20:  I mean he's pretty cute so no, you can prop it up like

1559
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:09,700
Speaker 20:  that and like w and you can stay engaged in what's going on.

1560
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:13,860
Speaker 20:  Like it's not, it's not gonna work in every situation, but it's just

1561
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:17,620
Speaker 20:  nice to have the option. You're like, oh I can, I don't have to be

1562
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:21,020
Speaker 20:  like glued to having my phone in front of me. I can set it here,

1563
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:24,660
Speaker 20:  play with stickers, whatever we're doing and yeah, it's just nice.

1564
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,740
Speaker 2:  It does seem like the big holdup for both the flip phones and the

1565
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:32,700
Speaker 2:  foldable phones is durability both in terms of like real

1566
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:36,500
Speaker 2:  sort of measurable things like the IP ratings and the scratchiness

1567
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:40,340
Speaker 2:  of the internal screens, but also just the, the the sort of

1568
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:44,060
Speaker 2:  feeling that you get using them and the like we're all used to

1569
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:47,260
Speaker 2:  carrying slabs of glass in our pocket but there is something about these

1570
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:50,620
Speaker 2:  devices, they have the crease, they, you feel something using the hinges

1571
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:53,540
Speaker 2:  like Allison, you talked about that last little push to kind of go from like

1572
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:57,380
Speaker 2:  160 degrees to 180 degrees open and it feels bad. It's like I

1573
01:31:57,380 --> 01:32:01,300
Speaker 2:  wonder if it's just gonna take a while both for us and for the technology

1574
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:04,580
Speaker 2:  to get to the point where like I don't have to treat this thing like it is

1575
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:06,020
Speaker 2:  a very fragile object.

1576
01:32:06,650 --> 01:32:10,220
Speaker 20:  Yeah. Something that people are always asking me about when they see a Fold

1577
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:13,460
Speaker 20:  foldable for the first time. Like, oh, so you can open it with one hand.

1578
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:17,580
Speaker 20:  I'm like, no, no, no, that actually feels

1579
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:21,700
Speaker 20:  terrible. Like it, it, I think it will take some adjustment like just even

1580
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:25,420
Speaker 20:  in our mindset of like what we expect to be able to do with them and what

1581
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:28,980
Speaker 20:  they're actually capable like up for right now.

1582
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:33,220
Speaker 21:  I, I think as a price comes down that becomes easier to manage as well.

1583
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:37,620
Speaker 21:  I mean again, $1,800 phone in six months, you don't want

1584
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:41,300
Speaker 21:  to have the hinge breaking or the screen breaking or whatever. I think that

1585
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:45,220
Speaker 21:  all of the companies can do a lot better with support not only just like

1586
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:49,060
Speaker 21:  giving you places to go and options if your folding device breaks,

1587
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:52,540
Speaker 21:  but making them in a way that it is easier to repair them

1588
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:56,420
Speaker 21:  when you know, the inevitable happens. Because we've had

1589
01:32:56,850 --> 01:33:00,700
Speaker 21:  Samsung's foldables for about four years now, but there

1590
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:04,220
Speaker 21:  were lots of reports in the early generations of like the screens just randomly

1591
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:08,060
Speaker 21:  cracking or you know, failing and things like that. You can look back to

1592
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:11,660
Speaker 21:  lots of user reports about those things and I think Samsung has slowly been

1593
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:15,060
Speaker 21:  addressing those as the generation's moved on, but that requires buying

1594
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:18,900
Speaker 21:  a new $1,800 phone every time. So it's like, it is how iteration works and

1595
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:21,540
Speaker 21:  improvement works, but we're not there where it's just like you can just

1596
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:25,660
Speaker 21:  carelessly or not carelessly but like not worry about it

1597
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,660
Speaker 21:  as much. It is something that you think about like when I go to the beach

1598
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:32,180
Speaker 21:  this summer, probably won't be bringing my foldable phone to read something

1599
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,980
Speaker 21:  on the beach, right? Because I'm terrified of getting a grain of sand in

1600
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:38,900
Speaker 21:  there still after four years. so like there, there's definitely lots of

1601
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:42,900
Speaker 21:  progress that needs to to happen on that front, both in the how

1602
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:46,420
Speaker 21:  durable the things are, how easy it is to get them fixed and how we're parable

1603
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,900
Speaker 21:  the devices are in the long run.

1604
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:50,940
Speaker 2:  Yeah, and the thing that gives me hope on all of those fronts is that both

1605
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:54,620
Speaker 2:  the Pixel Fold and the Razr Plus represent like real competition in those

1606
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:57,980
Speaker 2:  spaces kind of for the first time it's just been sort of Samsung off on its

1607
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:01,020
Speaker 2:  own island. There are a bunch of Chinese manufacturers doing really interesting

1608
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:04,580
Speaker 2:  work, but especially in the US it's just basically been Samsung and nobody.

1609
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:08,140
Speaker 2:  And now it feels like there is at least a good alternative

1610
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,300
Speaker 2:  in both Foldables and flippables and I'm very excited about that fact.

1611
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,700
Speaker 2:  I'm also just glad the Razr is back. Like I'm realizing as I talk about this,

1612
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:19,660
Speaker 2:  just saying the Razr like brings me joy as a person who grew up

1613
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,980
Speaker 2:  in the time the razors were the coolest. Like this just makes me happy. The

1614
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:26,700
Speaker 21:  Best part about the new Razors, David, is that you can launch the old Razr

1615
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:30,020
Speaker 21:  experience complete with the key tag. Wait, can you really? And the apps

1616
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,180
Speaker 21:  and everything, you can make it what? Oh yes, on the inside look like a

1617
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,580
Speaker 21:  2003 Razr. Yes.

1618
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:37,500
Speaker 2:  Oh, okay. Well done. I have to buy one now that I didn't know this. This

1619
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:41,420
Speaker 2:  changes everything. All right, well we need to wrap this up, but before we

1620
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:45,020
Speaker 2:  do, there are three of us, so we get to decide right now, majority rules

1621
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:49,060
Speaker 2:  once and for all flippable phones, foldable phones, both will exist

1622
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:53,020
Speaker 2:  forever, but only one gets to be the like default phone choice

1623
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,740
Speaker 2:  for everyone forever. Which one is it? Allison, you go first.

1624
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:58,740
Speaker 2:  Flip Dan.

1625
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:00,380
Speaker 22:  I gotta go with foldable

1626
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,540
Speaker 2:  Two to one. Flip phones win. I love it. Yeah,

1627
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,620
Speaker 1:  I knew I was losing this one.

1628
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:13,500
Speaker 2:  All right, before we go, let's get to The Vergecast hotline. And a reminder,

1632
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:29,300
Speaker 23:  Hi, my name is Rob, calling to see if you guys have some suggestions

1633
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,460
Speaker 23:  as to how to best play my PC games

1634
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:38,220
Speaker 23:  on my tv. I built a really great

1635
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:42,380
Speaker 23:  computer, but I find that sometimes I just want to sit back on the couch,

1636
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:45,940
Speaker 23:  relax and play some video games on my tv

1637
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,900
Speaker 23:  I'm hoping you guys have some suggestions on how to do that. Thanks.

1638
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,460
Speaker 2:  All right. True story, as soon as this one came in, Liam James, our producer

1639
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:58,500
Speaker 2:  was like, oh me, pick me. Pick me. I have to do this one. So here we go,

1640
01:35:58,650 --> 01:35:59,820
Speaker 2:  Liam. Take it away, my friend.

1641
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:03,910
Speaker 22:  Hey Rob. Thanks so much for this question and for calling in. Okay, so I

1642
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:07,230
Speaker 22:  just built a gaming pc so you have perfect timing. I had to answer this

1643
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:10,790
Speaker 22:  very same question, and it turns out that the answer is

1644
01:36:11,490 --> 01:36:15,070
Speaker 22:  the same. No matter what your situation, let's say your gaming PC is in

1645
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:18,830
Speaker 22:  your living room or across the room or in another room, a

1646
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:22,390
Speaker 22:  long H D M I cable is still gonna be the best way to go. It is the most

1647
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:25,830
Speaker 22:  reliable, the lowest latency, and obviously those things are really important

1648
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:29,750
Speaker 22:  for gaming. It's the only thing that's going to not

1649
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:33,150
Speaker 22:  give you headaches. There are some wireless solutions out there. They're

1650
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:36,190
Speaker 22:  expensive, they're flaky, they're unreliable. I can't recommend them.

1651
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:40,790
Speaker 22:  As far as controlling your gaming pc though, from the couch,

1652
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:44,870
Speaker 22:  you may have heard of Steam's big picture mode, but if you haven't, it's

1653
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:48,030
Speaker 22:  a great solution. If you're, especially if you're buying games in Steam,

1654
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:51,470
Speaker 22:  it just lets you navigate your library and pull up games and start them

1655
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:54,990
Speaker 22:  and, and move around without needing a mouse on a keyboard. Okay, hope that

1656
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:55,190
Speaker 22:  helps.

1657
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:59,390
Speaker 2:  Good stuff. All right. That is it for The Vergecast today. Thanks to everyone
