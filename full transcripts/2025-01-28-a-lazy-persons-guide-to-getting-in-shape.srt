Description: The Verge’s Victoria Song joins the show to talk about the most popular and most-bailed-on New Year’s Resolution of all: getting in shape. She tells us about the apps that help you work out more without being rude about it, the data you really need to care about in your fitness tracker, and much more. After that, we talk to Anna Valtonen, one of the curators and researchers behind the new Nokia Design Archive. She tells us about the concepts, presentations, and overall culture that made Nokia such an important company in the history of phones. Finally, we answer another question on the Vergecast Hotline about how audio works on your phone. It’s all still too complicated.

00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:07,035
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of immediately giving up

3
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:11,235
Speaker 2:  on every single one of your New Year's resolutions. It's the best way. Can't

4
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:14,875
Speaker 2:  recommend it highly enough. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and I am in sunny

5
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:18,515
Speaker 2:  West Palm Beach, Florida, where I'm here to see a thing called TGL Golf,

6
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:22,155
Speaker 2:  which is basically trying to take the game of golf, which is, you know, famously

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,515
Speaker 2:  played outside on grass and move it inside and make it

8
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:29,395
Speaker 2:  really technologically advanced with big screens and complicated

9
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:33,435
Speaker 2:  actuators and all kinds of new ideas about what watching

10
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:36,555
Speaker 2:  and playing golf can be like. We're gonna have more to say about that on

11
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:39,875
Speaker 2:  this show and on The Verge dot com in a couple of weeks, so stay tuned for

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,835
Speaker 2:  that. But it's nice to be outside. Whatcha gonna do. Anyway, we

13
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,715
Speaker 2:  have an awesome show coming up for you today. We're gonna do two things.

14
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:50,955
Speaker 2:  First, we're gonna talk to Vong about New Year's resolutions. She is a

15
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:54,435
Speaker 2:  person who thinks a lot about exercise and how people can do better

16
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:58,555
Speaker 2:  without making it so much work to do better. And right now

17
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:01,555
Speaker 2:  is the time of your people want to be healthier and want to get in better

18
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:05,155
Speaker 2:  shape and want to exercise more. So v and I are gonna try to figure out how

19
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:08,995
Speaker 2:  you can do that in a safe, sane, healthy way. It's gonna be great.

20
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:12,715
Speaker 2:  After that, we're gonna talk about this incredible new thing called The Nokia

21
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:16,595
Speaker 2:  Design Archive, which is this huge repository of

22
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:21,155
Speaker 2:  concepts, presentations, lifestyle videos, all

23
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:24,675
Speaker 2:  these different ideas back when Nokia was at the peak of its powers trying

24
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:28,235
Speaker 2:  to figure out the future of cell phones. Super fun and we're gonna get into

25
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:31,835
Speaker 2:  what's inside all of it. We also have a question on The Vergecast hotline

26
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:35,115
Speaker 2:  that's kind of a follow up to last week's question on The Vergecast hotline

27
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:39,195
Speaker 2:  about how audio comes and goes on your phone. Really fun one. Thank

28
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:43,075
Speaker 2:  you again to everybody who emails and calls. All that is coming

29
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:46,235
Speaker 2:  up in just a second. But first I honestly, I have to get outta the sun 'cause

30
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:49,115
Speaker 2:  this is the first time I've been outside in like three months and I think

31
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:52,275
Speaker 2:  I'm already starting to burn. This is The Vergecast, we'll be right back.

32
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:32,775
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. All right, I'm back from Florida. I have

33
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:36,735
Speaker 2:  suitably embarrassed myself trying to play on that gigantic simulator

34
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:40,495
Speaker 2:  in West Palm Beach. Let's get into it. So last week

35
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:44,535
Speaker 2:  I talked to Kevin Nguyen about how to read more books. It's a New Year's

36
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:47,495
Speaker 2:  resolution. A lot of people have, I think in a bunch of different directions,

37
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:50,695
Speaker 2:  right? There's the, I wanna read more books. There's also the, I wanna spend

38
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:53,855
Speaker 2:  less of my time scrolling on my phone and more of my time doing something

39
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:57,695
Speaker 2:  useful on my phone. So I talked to Kevin, who is the best

40
00:03:57,715 --> 00:04:01,135
Speaker 2:  and most accomplished book reader I know about how all that worked. Super

41
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:04,055
Speaker 2:  fun. We got a lot of great feedback from people. Thank you to everybody who

42
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:07,455
Speaker 2:  enjoyed that and told us. So super fun to hear from all of you.

43
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:11,815
Speaker 2:  This week we're gonna do something similar on a very different topic. I

44
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:15,575
Speaker 2:  think If you had to pick a number one New Year's resolution, it is,

45
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:19,655
Speaker 2:  I want to get in shape. And again that comes in lots of different varieties.

46
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:23,935
Speaker 2:  Some people are like, I want to go for one walk. And

47
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,695
Speaker 2:  other people are like, I am going to get like Brad Pitt in

48
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:31,495
Speaker 2:  Fight Club level shredded in two weeks. Happy New Year,

49
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:35,655
Speaker 2:  let's go. I think most of those resolutions don't

50
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:39,535
Speaker 2:  work. People don't stick to them. Famously, there are

51
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:43,615
Speaker 2:  huge amounts of gym memberships that get bought the first two weeks of January

52
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:48,095
Speaker 2:  and canceled the second two weeks of January. Like this stuff is tough

53
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:51,935
Speaker 2:  and I think part of it is because we don't make it easy on people to

54
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:55,575
Speaker 2:  stick to these kinds of resolutions. So I recruited the Verges Victoria

55
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:59,415
Speaker 2:  song to come on and help me figure out how we can do a little

56
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:03,175
Speaker 2:  better. How you can use apps and wearables

57
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:06,935
Speaker 2:  and platforms and all of these different ideas about how to

58
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:11,055
Speaker 2:  exercise and be in better shape and do more healthy stuff in your

59
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:15,015
Speaker 2:  life to our advantage and not be sort of beaten down by them to the

60
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,375
Speaker 2:  point where we don't wanna use them anymore. V thinks about a lot of this

61
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:22,335
Speaker 2:  in a way that I really like. She is like the most happy

62
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:26,455
Speaker 2:  exerciser, but also thinks the whole idea of exercising is

63
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:29,815
Speaker 2:  absurd. And I love that. Like I think that's exactly right. So I knew she'd

64
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:33,095
Speaker 2:  be the right person to come on and do this with. So let's get into it. V

65
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:37,055
Speaker 2:  song, welcome back. Hello. Thanks for having me. There's just

66
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:40,055
Speaker 2:  a lot of stuff happening right now. I feel like we could talk about rings,

67
00:05:40,315 --> 00:05:43,255
Speaker 2:  we could talk about other, I don't wanna talk about any of that stuff. Yeah,

68
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,375
Speaker 2:  none of it.

69
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:50,215
Speaker 2:  So we did this thing with Kevin Wynn last week where we basically tried to

70
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:53,655
Speaker 2:  break down one of the very common years resolutions into something that is

71
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:57,645
Speaker 2:  like achievable for regular people. And I think you

72
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:00,805
Speaker 2:  have an even harder job, which is we're gonna do this again with everybody's

73
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:03,525
Speaker 2:  number one New Year's resolution, which is, I'm going to get in shape,

74
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,605
Speaker 2:  It's that time of year. So

75
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:11,365
Speaker 7:  It it, it is that time of year let's let's destroy the New Year's

76
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:14,565
Speaker 7:  resolution fitness industrial complex. I'm here for it.

77
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:18,525
Speaker 2:  I like, I like that we're doing this kind of at the end of January

78
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:22,285
Speaker 2:  because there are a lot of people who have already lapsed on the gym memberships

79
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:26,005
Speaker 2:  that they signed up for. A lot of people who have like,

80
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:29,565
Speaker 2:  you know, they went on six runs and they were like, this is it. And then

81
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:32,805
Speaker 2:  we, and then it got cold and it stopped. And to all those people, I just

82
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:36,565
Speaker 2:  want you to know big same, like same exact

83
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:36,925
Speaker 2:  same,

84
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:41,005
Speaker 7:  Same from me too and I'm the running lady at at The Verge.

85
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:45,125
Speaker 7:  So like big, same like it's, it's it's fine.

86
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:49,245
Speaker 7:  Don't worry about it. Like I, you know, like if I can go off

87
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:53,045
Speaker 7:  on New Year's resolutions, particularly with relation to fitness,

88
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:57,205
Speaker 7:  like this year was particularly annoying just because

89
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:01,165
Speaker 7:  it was Apple and I think also Ladder, which is the strength

90
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:04,885
Speaker 7:  training app that I use. They both had these ad

91
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:08,965
Speaker 7:  campaigns centered on this idea of Quitter's day. And Quitter's

92
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:12,805
Speaker 7:  Day is the second Friday in January and it's the

93
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:16,605
Speaker 7:  day that statistically all these fitness apps have determined is the day

94
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:20,005
Speaker 7:  that most people quit their New Year's resolutions with relation to fitness.

95
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:24,245
Speaker 7:  Oh, interesting. And I think it's the biggest hawk of bullshit in, in

96
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:27,565
Speaker 7:  the world quitters day because what, this year it was

97
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:31,365
Speaker 7:  January 10th, I was flying back home from CES What do you mean

98
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:35,725
Speaker 7:  that by the 10th of January I've quit and failed

99
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:39,895
Speaker 7:  my like entire 2025 New Year's

100
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:43,935
Speaker 7:  resolution. There's like 265 days left in

101
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:47,735
Speaker 7:  the year. What are we talking about here? What is the concept of this? So

102
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:50,455
Speaker 7:  yeah, yeah, like I'm I'm not a about

103
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:54,295
Speaker 2:  It. Yeah, I'm completely with you. The idea that If you haven't been to the

104
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:57,695
Speaker 2:  gym every single day so far, you've failed and you should give up

105
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:01,495
Speaker 2:  is like the source of everything that is wrong with everything.

106
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,175
Speaker 2:  And it's actually a good segue because what, what I want talk about, you

107
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:09,015
Speaker 2:  and I talked to the founder of Zombies Run a while ago and

108
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:12,935
Speaker 2:  talked a bunch about this, like how do we find a saner way to help

109
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:16,135
Speaker 2:  people exercise more thing? And we got a ton of feedback on that episode.

110
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:19,735
Speaker 2:  People really liked it. And so I'm gonna, I wanna help people in kind of

111
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:23,015
Speaker 2:  that same way here. So I've been thinking about my own like

112
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:27,935
Speaker 2:  chiller exercise system for a while and have been trying to figure

113
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:31,895
Speaker 2:  out a way to do it that a doesn't shame me when I don't exercise for a

114
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:35,695
Speaker 2:  while, but also like is good and helpful and and useful and

115
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:39,535
Speaker 2:  productive. But I wanna know yours. Like you, you have a like

116
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:43,415
Speaker 2:  psychopath version of exercise I would say, which

117
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:46,495
Speaker 2:  is like, you wear a bunch of, you wear a bunch of rings, you use a bunch

118
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:50,215
Speaker 2:  of apps, you're like forever trying all of this stuff. But like regular

119
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:53,495
Speaker 2:  humans should not do that. No. Like where would you start a regular human

120
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:54,175
Speaker 2:  in this world?

121
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:58,525
Speaker 7:  I would would start a regular human not doing anything digital

122
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,645
Speaker 7:  actually. I would start a regular human with maybe

123
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:07,325
Speaker 7:  just a pen and paper and ask them like what their actual goals are.

124
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:11,285
Speaker 7:  Mm. Like what, what do you actually want to do? Because goals like

125
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:12,605
Speaker 7:  get shredded by June.

126
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:18,165
Speaker 7:  If you have already 19% body fat, okay,

127
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:22,005
Speaker 7:  maybe we can do that for you. But If you like you kind of just have to take

128
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:25,885
Speaker 7:  stock of where you are very honestly, right? And then figure out what your

129
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:29,205
Speaker 7:  goals are and then how do we break that? Like really it's about

130
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,325
Speaker 7:  goal setting. So

131
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:36,885
Speaker 7:  I used to do things like in a year I'm gonna run a marathon. Well guess what

132
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:40,445
Speaker 7:  guys? That that didn't happen right? Because like that just wasn't

133
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:45,005
Speaker 7:  achievable. If you're going from couch to marathon,

134
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:48,685
Speaker 7:  like you'll see all these influencers online and they'll say things like,

135
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:52,685
Speaker 7:  hey, it's totally doable within a year. It's doable within a year If

136
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:56,485
Speaker 7:  you wanna suffer and like do it badly. Yeah. Like it's technically doable

137
00:09:56,485 --> 00:10:00,325
Speaker 7:  in a year, but do you wanna enjoy it? Like that's the thing that

138
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:04,485
Speaker 7:  none of these apps and digital things tell you is that they are just tools.

139
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:08,565
Speaker 7:  And my big beef is that all of the, all of them are coming out and saying

140
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:11,845
Speaker 7:  things like we have ai, we have an AI chat bot, it's gonna help you figure

141
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:15,045
Speaker 7:  out everything that you need to do that you don't know, which I'm empathetic

142
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:18,885
Speaker 7:  to because figuring out your own fitness routine, like, I

143
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,805
Speaker 7:  hate to tell you this, it's going to take you years. Yeah. It's not gonna

144
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:25,725
Speaker 7:  be something that happens in a few weeks. It's not gonna be something that

145
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,445
Speaker 7:  happens in a few months. It's gonna be a year's long

146
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:33,245
Speaker 7:  journey to get to absolutely shredded for that one summer.

147
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,365
Speaker 7:  So it's like, first of all, like slow your

148
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:40,445
Speaker 7:  role, figure out what your goals are and then once you've done that, like

149
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:44,125
Speaker 7:  just kinda look at yourself honestly and be like, how well do, like what

150
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:48,005
Speaker 7:  do I respond well to Hmm. In terms of coaching and in terms of

151
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:51,925
Speaker 7:  style. Because If you are looking for one of these apps to kind of help coach

152
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:55,725
Speaker 7:  you, like are you someone who responds well to drill sergeant stuff?

153
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:59,925
Speaker 7:  Are you someone who, like you just need your hand held and like be told

154
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,045
Speaker 7:  that you're great and that everything is wonderful and that it's okay?

155
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,605
Speaker 7:  I'm actually the latter. I don't respond well to drill sergeants. I was

156
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:07,765
Speaker 7:  just

157
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:10,245
Speaker 2:  About to guess that about you. I don't, yeah, I don't think yelling at you

158
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:12,005
Speaker 2:  is is the way to get you to succeed.

159
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:16,125
Speaker 7:  No, I actually was going to boxing classes for some period

160
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,485
Speaker 7:  of time a few years back and I had a drill sergeant in, in a class and he

161
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:19,685
Speaker 7:  is like,

162
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:24,085
Speaker 8:  I didn't say you could give up. And I was like, I didn't say I was giving

163
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:24,325
Speaker 8:  up.

164
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:28,605
Speaker 7:  And so I went really hard and then afterwards I vomited in

165
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,205
Speaker 7:  the locker room because I went too hard. I didn't listen to myself. Like,

166
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:35,645
Speaker 7:  I was like sweating and I like, my friend was like, are are you okay? I think

167
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,805
Speaker 7:  I think you went too hard. And it's like, yeah, 'cause the drill sergeant

168
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:38,445
Speaker 7:  made me angry.

169
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:43,805
Speaker 7:  So you have to be honest with yourself about like that sort of stuff. And

170
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:47,765
Speaker 7:  then from there you can kind of sort through the stuff that works

171
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:51,285
Speaker 7:  for you. And because I don't like drill sergeants because I don't like, I

172
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:55,125
Speaker 7:  am a perfectionist by nature, so I don't like feeling like I'm failing. I

173
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:58,885
Speaker 7:  do really well with the chill stuff. And so I have settled on using

174
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:03,005
Speaker 7:  an Apple watch or a Garmin depending on where I am in my testing cycle. This

175
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:06,965
Speaker 7:  is like, again, very specific to me that I only

176
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:10,805
Speaker 7:  have two wrists and I always have to be testing things. So I, I settle

177
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:14,645
Speaker 7:  on the trackers that for me as a runner offer me the

178
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:17,805
Speaker 7:  most running specific stuff that I can use

179
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,325
Speaker 7:  a running app which has like a, a little training program in there

180
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,965
Speaker 7:  for me. And I use gentler streaks a lot because

181
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:31,165
Speaker 7:  it uses the concept of streaks, but it also allows you to

182
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:35,965
Speaker 7:  take several breaks and you're not penalized for it. It

183
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:39,885
Speaker 7:  will basically be like, Hey, you pushed it really hard, maybe don't do that.

184
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:43,885
Speaker 7:  And then if you're kind of falling off it, it might pop up and say like,

185
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:47,885
Speaker 7:  Hey, you haven't done things for a while. How about we do something like

186
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:51,325
Speaker 7:  really fun and gentle to get back into things. And like I'll admit over,

187
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:54,685
Speaker 7:  over Christmas I got one of those notifications. I was like, no, shut up.

188
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:59,045
Speaker 7:  I thank you for reminding me that I forgot to put you on pause. I will be

189
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,245
Speaker 7:  going back to Christmas cookies presently. Right?

190
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:07,325
Speaker 2:  Somebody gave me advice one time that they, their, their like, main idea

191
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:11,125
Speaker 2:  for me was that If you have to lie to your exercise system, it's the wrong

192
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:14,885
Speaker 2:  exercise system and it goes for everything, right? Like If you, If you have

193
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:18,445
Speaker 2:  a personal trainer and you have to lie to your personal trainer, you have

194
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,485
Speaker 2:  the wrong, you either shouldn't have a personal trainer or you have the wrong

195
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:24,605
Speaker 2:  personal trainer. If you have to go in and like dial down the

196
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:28,445
Speaker 2:  settings in an app on your phone in order for you to be able to hit

197
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:32,285
Speaker 2:  your goal. You have, you haven't set up the incentives in the wrong

198
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:35,965
Speaker 2:  way. And I say this as somebody who has done both of those things and it

199
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:39,365
Speaker 2:  just, it, it should be a sign If you have to go into your streaks app and

200
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,965
Speaker 2:  be like, no, no, I did it yesterday. Wink wink. Just to keep the streak going.

201
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:44,245
Speaker 2:  Like this is a bad system for you.

202
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:47,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah, no. Like you should be able to pause. That's why I was so happy last

203
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:51,045
Speaker 7:  year when Apple introduced pausing your rings. Totally. 'cause it,

204
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:55,405
Speaker 7:  it basically kind of ensures that

205
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:59,485
Speaker 7:  you can take breaks and that you can take rests and like there's, there's

206
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:02,685
Speaker 7:  a lot of stuff out there about how you should never

207
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,125
Speaker 7:  break your streaks. And the, again, this is bullshit because

208
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:11,085
Speaker 7:  life is life. You will break your streaks. It's a matter of not if, but

209
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:11,445
Speaker 7:  when.

210
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:15,005
Speaker 2:  I think a lot about you saying to me a while ago that you break yours on

211
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:18,125
Speaker 2:  purpose sometimes Yes. When you find yourself getting too attached to them.

212
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:21,445
Speaker 2:  And I think that's actually like weirdly good life advice.

213
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:25,725
Speaker 7:  It's, no, you should like, 'cause here's the thing, If you are so obsessed

214
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:29,525
Speaker 7:  with your streaks, and this is like therapy with v about fitness, that's

215
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:32,645
Speaker 7:  what we're here for. If you're so obsessed with your streaks, then at some

216
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:36,125
Speaker 7:  level you do not have confidence in yourself that you will go back to it

217
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:39,965
Speaker 7:  Like you are depending on the streak to say that you are consistent.

218
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:43,605
Speaker 7:  Now break your streak and trust in yourself that you will go back to it.

219
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:47,685
Speaker 7:  Like that's, that's how you prove to yourself that like the streak isn't

220
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:51,400
Speaker 7:  what matters. It's the, the knowledge that you have have built

221
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:56,645
Speaker 7:  some sort of consistent routine. And like, this

222
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,805
Speaker 7:  is like fundamentally what we're going to get at though is that all of this,

223
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:03,765
Speaker 7:  all of these things, they're tools, they're tools that you use. You are the

224
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:07,685
Speaker 7:  captain of the ship. You get to decide like what is gonna work for

225
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:11,645
Speaker 7:  you and like what you enjoy and what, what, like, it

226
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:15,405
Speaker 7:  it's basically tricking yourself into deciding like,

227
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:19,605
Speaker 7:  I enjoy this and until it's actually true. So like I didn't start

228
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:23,485
Speaker 7:  out running enjoying it. I, I'm telling you I was, I was running and I was

229
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:26,965
Speaker 7:  like, this is freaking torture. Who are these people who do this? And now

230
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,725
Speaker 7:  I don't feel good if I don't run per week. And I don't like that.

231
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:34,845
Speaker 2:  Okay. But I agree with every single thing you just said, but you're

232
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:38,565
Speaker 2:  describing like an end state, right? Like this is, this is the thing you

233
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:41,405
Speaker 2:  should get to. And I think every I I agree that that is a, an achievable

234
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:45,165
Speaker 2:  place for everybody to get and it's easier than you think. I think to

235
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:48,485
Speaker 2:  me the the biggest challenge is like, it's the the trough of

236
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:51,525
Speaker 2:  disillusionment, right? The thing where I've been on four runs

237
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:56,345
Speaker 2:  because I have, I have some internal discipline. Hooray for me, running

238
00:15:56,435 --> 00:16:00,185
Speaker 2:  still sucks and I'm just gonna stop, right? And that is like

239
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:03,905
Speaker 2:  for me with, with exercise, that has been the thing that has killed me so

240
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:07,745
Speaker 2:  many times, right? Is like I get, I have, I have this much discipline and

241
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:11,585
Speaker 2:  so I will, I will use the discipline that I have to go out and

242
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:15,345
Speaker 2:  do something and then I, it doesn't immediately get

243
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:18,985
Speaker 2:  better or more fun or show results. And so I bail and I think

244
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,225
Speaker 2:  one of the things I have spent a huge amount of time looking for in

245
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:27,225
Speaker 2:  the fitness space as a result is the, like, the right

246
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:31,505
Speaker 2:  cadence of helping me improve and sort of reminding

247
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:34,785
Speaker 2:  me to improve. And one thing you mentioned the the like couch to marathon

248
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:38,825
Speaker 2:  pipeline. One thing that I have found that I love is couch to 5K

249
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:42,705
Speaker 2:  apps because like I, I actually, I I am,

250
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:46,105
Speaker 2:  I, I exercise enough that I'm not starting at the couch level, but having

251
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,745
Speaker 2:  the thing where it's just like, okay David, today what we're gonna do is

252
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:52,265
Speaker 2:  we're gonna go for a six minute walk and all you have to do is not die. Is

253
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:56,145
Speaker 2:  like, that's actually perfect for me. That it is like just the, the

254
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:59,705
Speaker 2:  tiniest bit of push to get out and then it's like, maybe I'll ignore the

255
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:02,065
Speaker 2:  app and keep running or maybe I'll do the six minute walk and go home and

256
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:04,185
Speaker 2:  feel good about myself because I've accomplished my goals for the day.

257
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,545
Speaker 2:  So few apps do that well because they're all either geared towards people

258
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:13,225
Speaker 2:  for whom fitness is like a lifestyle or they're trying to convince you that

259
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:16,545
Speaker 2:  fitness is a lifestyle because that's how they, you know, get you engaged

260
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:20,385
Speaker 2:  in buying merchant, buying their subscriptions and stuff. And this

261
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:24,265
Speaker 2:  like how to start and do better

262
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:28,145
Speaker 2:  without making it, your whole personality thing is so hard to find

263
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:30,865
Speaker 2:  in this space. And it is the thing that drives me the most crazy about it.

264
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,985
Speaker 7:  It is really hard. And so like I just, it's, it's difficult because

265
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:38,865
Speaker 7:  I don't think anyone does it particularly well for true beginners. Like

266
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:42,785
Speaker 7:  I think Fitness Plus does it Okay. Except for the fact that all

267
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:46,105
Speaker 7:  of their strength stuff still puts in pushups and like

268
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:50,565
Speaker 7:  no. Yeah. Just no. Like, excuse me. No. And they're like, you can

269
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:53,965
Speaker 7:  do it on your knees. No, we need to go to, to the part where you show someone

270
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:57,845
Speaker 7:  doing it on a wall because like wall pushups are like, where,

271
00:17:58,055 --> 00:17:59,965
Speaker 7:  let's be honest, a lot of people are gonna be starting,

272
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:03,165
Speaker 2:  I'm just gonna lie down while you do pushups. It's like, that's that's where

273
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:03,605
Speaker 2:  I'm at that's

274
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:06,965
Speaker 7:  Gonna like, I'm, I'm not at the point where I do knee pushups even still

275
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:10,925
Speaker 7:  like I'm, I'm at the wall like a lot of times And I think it's, it's just

276
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:16,085
Speaker 7:  allowing yourself to say, I'm going to do it so easy

277
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:19,885
Speaker 7:  that it feels like I'm not actually doing it. So like

278
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:23,805
Speaker 7:  one thing that I like from services like Fitness Plus is that you can do

279
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:27,685
Speaker 7:  10 minutes, you can do five, 10 minutes, just do five, 10

280
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:31,445
Speaker 7:  minutes three times a week. You can program it in there and you know, we

281
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:35,325
Speaker 7:  have this tendency to be like, go hard, go fast. No, go slow, go easy.

282
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:39,165
Speaker 7:  Like it should be easy. Like fitness should be easy. It should not be something

283
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:42,605
Speaker 7:  that is difficult. Like I all, like you

284
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,045
Speaker 7:  hear a lot of stuff about people saying things like, oh my god,

285
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:50,685
Speaker 7:  grind. Like no pain, no gain. And actually like I'm here to tell you

286
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:54,685
Speaker 7:  no do do a really easy thing. Like what I love about Couch to 5K apps, like

287
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:58,285
Speaker 7:  you said is that day one is a six minute walk. Yeah. Anybody can do a six

288
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:01,405
Speaker 7:  minute walk. And one of the things that really helped me out of a slump,

289
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:05,365
Speaker 7:  because it's a lie that If you are someone with established fitness

290
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:09,245
Speaker 7:  habits that you will not slump. I had a really bad slump last year where

291
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:12,965
Speaker 7:  I was just like not, I didn't wanna do any of it. I felt my fitness like

292
00:19:13,095 --> 00:19:16,925
Speaker 7:  completely like 2023. Like my fitness era

293
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:20,245
Speaker 7:  was just like going so down. And it was super depressing because all of these

294
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:24,125
Speaker 7:  apps were just showing me and quantified data how slow I was getting,

295
00:19:24,385 --> 00:19:28,125
Speaker 7:  how like the arrows were all down right. And I was not happy about it. And

296
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,085
Speaker 7:  so like one of the things you have to do is to be able to go like, this is

297
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:35,965
Speaker 7:  not working. An established system I have is not working. I then

298
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:39,525
Speaker 7:  went and downloaded this app called Fantasy Hike

299
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:44,245
Speaker 7:  and I love it. It's off-brand Lord of the Rings. You're

300
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:47,845
Speaker 7:  walking to Mount Mount Doom. Like

301
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:52,365
Speaker 7:  you're, you're competing with Mr. Underhill who's Frodo

302
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:56,445
Speaker 7:  but you know, copyright safe and you know, there's Harry Foot Potter

303
00:19:56,785 --> 00:19:59,085
Speaker 7:  and John Snowflake and

304
00:19:59,505 --> 00:20:03,365
Speaker 2:  So it's like a step tracker with like gentle competitiveness in

305
00:20:03,365 --> 00:20:06,645
Speaker 7:  It. Gentle competitiveness. Oh I like that. You can, like, you could only

306
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:10,765
Speaker 7:  compete against Frodo who like walks really fast

307
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:14,485
Speaker 7:  like and absurdly. You're not gonna beat Mr. Frodo but you can

308
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:19,045
Speaker 7:  absolutely beat Harry Foot Potter who like is so like

309
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:22,525
Speaker 7:  his little description is like, he's really tired from like his life and

310
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,325
Speaker 7:  he's just going real easy. Yeah, he's a lot to you definitely can beat him.

311
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:29,085
Speaker 7:  You definitely can beat him. And so like, I've been using this app for a

312
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:32,565
Speaker 7:  little over a year now and I'm almost at Mor Door. Nice. And it's so nice

313
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:36,245
Speaker 7:  because it's just whatever I do during a day, like

314
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:40,605
Speaker 7:  it's not anything. There's a little bit of competition in there. So

315
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:44,485
Speaker 7:  I use it to be like, I gotta beat Alice. I'm definitely not gonna beat

316
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:48,365
Speaker 7:  John Snow, but like, maybe I won't be beat by him by too much.

317
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:51,645
Speaker 7:  I definitely wanna finish in between those two. So that's kind of my goal.

318
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:56,125
Speaker 7:  And then I, I, some days I'll be like, oh, I've moved,

319
00:20:56,465 --> 00:21:00,325
Speaker 7:  not at all today. Let me just put a few miles between me and Alice

320
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:01,485
Speaker 7:  and it's great. Wait,

321
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:04,445
Speaker 2:  I really like that. So one of the things I was thinking about coming into

322
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:08,285
Speaker 2:  this is the, the thing that I have found is most

323
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:12,245
Speaker 2:  useful for myself is just step tracking. Like I find there's

324
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,605
Speaker 2:  a lot of like, you know, I wanna get stronger, I wanna get faster, whatever.

325
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,525
Speaker 2:  And like that you can focus on that. But in terms of like day to day

326
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:22,565
Speaker 2:  health maintenance, like it, it just is true that walking is very

327
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:23,525
Speaker 2:  good for your health.

328
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:25,285
Speaker 7:  Walking is the best.

329
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:29,415
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And like the 10,000 step thing is, is sort of

330
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,575
Speaker 2:  nonsense but is also like a useful bar. Like If you walk that much, it

331
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:37,375
Speaker 2:  is good for your body to do so. But what I've always struggled with is

332
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:41,255
Speaker 2:  I'm like, okay, I get in the like eight range

333
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:44,335
Speaker 2:  just kind of by being alive most days, right? Like I have a kid that I chase

334
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:48,135
Speaker 2:  around, there's a coffee shop that is the exact right distance that I go

335
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:52,015
Speaker 2:  there several times all the time. It's like I, I get there and

336
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:55,695
Speaker 2:  so I'm like, okay, I'm gonna get like 12 or 15. And I find even motivating

337
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:59,215
Speaker 2:  myself to do that requires going out and doing something sort of on purpose.

338
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:03,575
Speaker 2:  And I don't because I'm lazy and don't want to, but this idea of

339
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:07,415
Speaker 2:  like, I'm, I'm gonna, not only am I doing this like for the

340
00:22:07,415 --> 00:22:10,455
Speaker 2:  benefit of my health that there is this sort of game going on in the background.

341
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,255
Speaker 2:  I think that might work for me.

342
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,895
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's really great. 'cause every once in a while you hit a milestone,

343
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:19,615
Speaker 7:  I'm like, oh I hit the Dancing Pony or whatever the off-brand version is

344
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:23,495
Speaker 7:  like, right? It's like Riverdale, not Rivendale is

345
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:26,135
Speaker 7:  like the little castle and it's like, oh I've hit, I've hit the council.

346
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:30,135
Speaker 7:  Cool. So like love this. I'm, I'm in Mordor at the moment. I'm almost at,

347
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:34,215
Speaker 7:  I'm almost there and it's just like, oh and it, and like what I love about

348
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:37,575
Speaker 7:  that particular app, which is unfortunately it is iOS only and you do have

349
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:41,295
Speaker 7:  to pay to like move more than a mile a day. I find it worth it.

350
00:22:41,715 --> 00:22:45,655
Speaker 7:  But like the thing I love about it is that it kind of very

351
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:49,695
Speaker 7:  visualizes your, it's very visual in seeing your progress. Hmm.

352
00:22:49,695 --> 00:22:52,995
Speaker 7:  Because in a year I've walked maybe

353
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:56,755
Speaker 7:  1600 miles. Wow. All all I'm, I'm, I'm about to

354
00:22:56,995 --> 00:23:00,875
Speaker 7:  get to 1600 miles 'cause that's the distance that they go. So you can

355
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,875
Speaker 7:  kind of see like, oh no, I, I actually did walk

356
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:08,475
Speaker 7:  from the Shire to, you know, more like that is,

357
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:11,795
Speaker 7:  that is like a very visual thing and it works for me. It tickles my brain

358
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:12,955
Speaker 7:  in such a delightful way.

359
00:23:13,345 --> 00:23:16,955
Speaker 2:  It's such a good like context list number too because I have no idea

360
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:21,395
Speaker 2:  if in the scheme of things that is a lot or a little, but it sounds

361
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:24,195
Speaker 2:  like a lot and it feels like you've accomplished something and that's really

362
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:25,955
Speaker 2:  cool and that's kind of all it needs to do.

363
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:29,555
Speaker 7:  That's all it needs to do. Yeah. Because I love step tracking in the sense

364
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:33,155
Speaker 7:  that like I think it's a very, there there was like a push away from it because

365
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:36,875
Speaker 7:  like they said, 10,000 steps is just a number that they used for

366
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,995
Speaker 7:  marketing for a pedometer a long time ago. There's no scientific basis in

367
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:43,835
Speaker 7:  it. Which is, which is true. But it can feel mundane

368
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:47,605
Speaker 7:  to just like not hit your goal every day. Yes. Right. It can feel like a

369
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:51,565
Speaker 7:  little bit like failure. This there's, there's no daily prescription that

370
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:54,845
Speaker 7:  you have to do. You're just walking, you're just walking to more door. You're

371
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:58,325
Speaker 7:  just visualizing your progress over this time. And there's like a lot of

372
00:23:58,325 --> 00:24:01,685
Speaker 7:  different ways to do kind of step count. I think

373
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:06,085
Speaker 7:  a lot of times it's tweaking what you viewed the metrics to be. So instead

374
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:09,165
Speaker 7:  of a daily step count, maybe you do a weekly one because that gives you a

375
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:12,725
Speaker 7:  little flexibility to be a couch potato once in a while. Yeah. So like

376
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,525
Speaker 7:  finding something that will let you track your steps weekly and

377
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:20,805
Speaker 7:  putting those widgets upfront instead of like, you

378
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:24,165
Speaker 7:  know, like Fitbit lets you customize which widgets you see and what you do.

379
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:27,925
Speaker 7:  So some, for some people steps may not be it, but like activity minutes

380
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:31,965
Speaker 7:  are so, okay, you put activity minutes up and the guided goal

381
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:36,045
Speaker 7:  is like 150 minutes of moderate activity per week is all you

382
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:39,845
Speaker 7:  really need. And like whatever it is, I think it

383
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:43,445
Speaker 7:  should feel so easy when you're starting out that it feels like cheating.

384
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:48,125
Speaker 7:  Like this can't possibly be correct. It it, it's good, it's all good, it's

385
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:51,845
Speaker 7:  all good. And then eventually over time you build it up. But like, it should

386
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:55,565
Speaker 7:  be easy. It should be like so easy that you feel bad not doing it.

387
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:59,965
Speaker 7:  Like, you know, sometimes you're in bed and you're like, oh I

388
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,525
Speaker 7:  should really, I don't know, check the mail. Like it should be that

389
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:07,365
Speaker 7:  degree of, of easy and you just like build it into your day over time

390
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:10,805
Speaker 7:  because like we like you, you, you pointed out

391
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:15,135
Speaker 7:  we're so eager to get to the end state and then

392
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:18,775
Speaker 7:  I have some bad news. You're never gonna reach an end state.

393
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:22,495
Speaker 7:  It's like, like I, I don't know what to tell you. You just never reach an

394
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:25,695
Speaker 7:  end state 'cause you hit one goal and then you're gonna wanna do another

395
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:29,655
Speaker 7:  because like that's just not what it's about. So

396
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:33,615
Speaker 7:  like for my quote unquote New Year's resolution, like my goal, which is a

397
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,655
Speaker 7:  carryover from last year is to do a 5K and under 30 minutes

398
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:41,255
Speaker 7:  I'm at 32 minutes for a 5K.

399
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:45,175
Speaker 7:  Which is great because I had had a slump way before and I

400
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:48,815
Speaker 7:  was like much slower than that for a while. And you know, there is a past

401
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:52,455
Speaker 7:  version of myself that was much faster. Like I was at one point doing five

402
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:56,615
Speaker 7:  Ks in 27, 28 minutes and I'm not that at that point anymore. And

403
00:25:56,615 --> 00:26:00,495
Speaker 7:  I could feel bad about myself or I could just be like, oh this

404
00:26:00,495 --> 00:26:04,215
Speaker 7:  app said good job. I did do a good job. I wait, I made it to Moreor.

405
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:08,055
Speaker 7:  Yeah I made it to Moreor. Or like we did Stompers as as an office

406
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:12,015
Speaker 7:  for a while. Which was just, which one is Stompers? Stompers is the,

407
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:16,015
Speaker 7:  the so and Ivinson app where you just whack each

408
00:26:16,015 --> 00:26:19,855
Speaker 7:  other with with bats. Oh right. And for a while that was really fun

409
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:23,055
Speaker 7:  while people were into it. Now I feel like I'm the only person still doing

410
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:26,415
Speaker 7:  it and now I have to friend strangers and whack strangers in the middle of

411
00:26:26,415 --> 00:26:29,455
Speaker 7:  the day. But it's nice because I'll get a notification and it's like someone

412
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:33,335
Speaker 7:  just passed you and I'm like, by how much? Oh not by much let's

413
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:36,455
Speaker 7:  walk a little bit and whack this stranger. And so like I have fun doing that.

414
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,855
Speaker 7:  I like that. It's just how can you trick yourself into having fun?

415
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,845
Speaker 7:  Like honestly it's fun. So like for you David, it just might be that you

416
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:48,565
Speaker 7:  haven't found a thing that you genuinely find is fun and or maybe walking

417
00:26:48,665 --> 00:26:52,525
Speaker 7:  is a thing that's fun for you and do that you don't have to

418
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:56,205
Speaker 7:  run. I'm gonna say athletes are the most annoying people, especially

419
00:26:56,565 --> 00:27:00,045
Speaker 7:  quantified fitness athletes because they're all on Strava and they're all

420
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:03,885
Speaker 7:  talking about all of these things. You have my full permission as the wearable

421
00:27:03,885 --> 00:27:07,845
Speaker 7:  ladies to just turn off all your notifications for the rest of January. You

422
00:27:07,845 --> 00:27:09,405
Speaker 7:  have my full permission to do that.

423
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:13,485
Speaker 2:  Let's talk about that piece of it for one second because I think again, all

424
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:16,885
Speaker 2:  of these things want you to make fitness to your entire personality and become

425
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:20,685
Speaker 2:  a Strava person. And If you wanna do that, that's fine. Just don't talk to

426
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:23,405
Speaker 2:  like leave me alone about it. But like there are lots of other people on

427
00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:26,205
Speaker 2:  Strava who wanna talk to you about their Strava numbers. So like Godspeed.

428
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:30,485
Speaker 2:  But there is some quantification here that is

429
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:33,325
Speaker 2:  useful. Like I think If you're a person who is like, I wanna get in shape

430
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:36,405
Speaker 2:  this year, spending a lot of time worrying about your VO two max in 2025

431
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,525
Speaker 2:  is probably not useful.

432
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:38,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

433
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:42,845
Speaker 2:  What is useful? Like what, what numbers should people pay attention to?

434
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,285
Speaker 7:  So the numbers that they should pay attention to are their baselines. Okay.

435
00:27:47,285 --> 00:27:51,205
Speaker 7:  Like just figure out where you're at. Give yourself like two to four weeks

436
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:55,085
Speaker 7:  to figure out what your baseline is. And like you're gonna feel so

437
00:27:55,085 --> 00:27:58,645
Speaker 7:  impatient 'cause you're gonna feel like you're not doing anything. You are

438
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:01,645
Speaker 7:  doing the most important thing, which is to just figure out what your baseline

439
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:02,685
Speaker 7:  is. Because if

440
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:06,885
Speaker 2:  Baseline in what sense? Like go go run an easy mile and just

441
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:09,285
Speaker 2:  see how that goes and start from there. Like that kind of thing.

442
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:12,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Okay. See how that goes. Just how long does it take you to run a mile?

443
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:16,805
Speaker 7:  Can you even run a mile? Like that's fine. What is your daily step

444
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:20,685
Speaker 7:  count like just naturally. Just as you are doing now? Like

445
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:24,285
Speaker 7:  just neutrally. You're not bad for having an

446
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:27,645
Speaker 7:  unimpressive step count. You're not bad. You just need to know where to start.

447
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Because the thing about all of these tools is that they're like, here,

448
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:33,845
Speaker 7:  here, here we are. We're gonna give you all of these metrics. Yeah. Nobody

449
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:38,445
Speaker 7:  fuck all like what does, what do these numbers mean? Right? The most important

450
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:42,045
Speaker 7:  thing is for you to understand what your baseline is. So let's say you

451
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:46,565
Speaker 7:  baseline, in your average daily life, all you're doing is two to 3000

452
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:49,925
Speaker 7:  steps. Great. I love that for you. So next week

453
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:54,525
Speaker 7:  try 500 steps more per day. That's it. That's it. That's all you gotta do.

454
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:58,085
Speaker 7:  Just 500 steps more. That's like two minutes of walking maybe.

455
00:28:58,235 --> 00:29:02,125
Speaker 7:  Like it's not a very long amount, but just 500 steps more.

456
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,365
Speaker 7:  Right. See, see how you do, see how, how that is is that easy for you? Okay,

457
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:09,045
Speaker 7:  cool. And then after two weeks of doing that, add

458
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:12,085
Speaker 7:  500 steps to that. Oh all of a sudden you're doing a thousand more and just

459
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:15,885
Speaker 7:  go until you hit a goal number and there are just gonna be some

460
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:19,605
Speaker 7:  weeks where you don't hit that goal. Okay. So then you just repeat it and

461
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:23,205
Speaker 7:  just repeat it until you can do that. Same thing with calorie. Like just

462
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:26,925
Speaker 7:  choose one thing. Just choose one metric to to be your metric. So

463
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:30,605
Speaker 7:  either choose activity minutes, how many minutes you're doing during a week.

464
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:34,365
Speaker 7:  Choose your your steps if that's what works. And for your brain the most.

465
00:29:34,545 --> 00:29:37,645
Speaker 7:  Or choose like, If you are already

466
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,165
Speaker 7:  committed to working out at the gym, choose like a number of times times

467
00:29:41,265 --> 00:29:45,145
Speaker 7:  you go to the gym. Like go to the gym, go on the

468
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:48,145
Speaker 7:  treadmill for 10 minutes and that's it. You can go home. Like, I just did

469
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:51,505
Speaker 7:  that with, with my spouse last night. We were both like, it's icy out. We

470
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:54,425
Speaker 7:  both prefer running outdoors but we can't 'cause we'll break our neck.

471
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:59,145
Speaker 7:  How about we go to the gym for 15 minutes

472
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:03,065
Speaker 7:  and if we do more, that's a success. We did 22 minutes and then we

473
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:07,025
Speaker 7:  left. That's it. I did, I did the world's most half-ass

474
00:30:07,145 --> 00:30:10,505
Speaker 7:  treadmill run. 'cause I hate treadmills. And I was like, I did 20 minutes

475
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:12,905
Speaker 7:  on the treadmill. I am a God. And I left.

476
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:17,465
Speaker 2:  I had, I had a friend a while ago who's, he said his goal as like, I

477
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:20,825
Speaker 2:  can, I can check it off if I walk in the door of the gym

478
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:24,425
Speaker 2:  if like, yeah. Literally all I have to do, I have to walk in the front door

479
00:30:24,485 --> 00:30:27,665
Speaker 2:  and I can turn around and leave and it counts. And I did it. And he was like,

480
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:31,585
Speaker 2:  I never actually just did it. But the point was like, make

481
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:35,425
Speaker 2:  the goal so easy that you're gonna hit it all the time. Yeah. Because it's

482
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:39,185
Speaker 2:  the knot hitting the goal that prevents you from stopping. Yeah. 100%. I

483
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:41,305
Speaker 2:  I think about that. I think about him all the time. It's just like all I,

484
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:44,785
Speaker 2:  like just, he just like walks in, opens the door to Planet Fitness, like

485
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:47,425
Speaker 2:  high fives the person behind the desk and leaves and he's like, great, what's,

486
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:47,825
Speaker 2:  what's that?

487
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:50,385
Speaker 7:  Everybody that's me. That, that's, that's me. That's, that's what I do too.

488
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:54,505
Speaker 7:  And it's, it's honestly like I just have to go get on the treadmill for five

489
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:58,425
Speaker 7:  minutes and I'm allowed to leave at that five minutes and I almost

490
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:02,305
Speaker 7:  never do leave at the five minutes. Maybe I'll do 10 or whatever. But

491
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:05,825
Speaker 7:  the the whole point is that you're just tricking yourself the entire time

492
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:09,985
Speaker 7:  and setting the goal. Like my, my number one tip for any of the

493
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:13,905
Speaker 7:  devices that you get is to one, pick a metric and then make

494
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,865
Speaker 7:  the goal so stupidly easy, you feel like you're cheating

495
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:22,305
Speaker 7:  and then you'll, you'll increase it over time. But like, I, I

496
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:25,385
Speaker 7:  really think that anyone who's a beginner should just start out doing like,

497
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:30,475
Speaker 7:  I wanna say 10 minutes, twice a week. That's it. That's it. You can do that.

498
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:33,715
Speaker 7:  Anybody can do 10 minutes twice a week and then

499
00:31:34,615 --> 00:31:38,595
Speaker 7:  you just go up from there. And If you never go up from there and you're

500
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:42,355
Speaker 7:  just doing 10 minutes twice a week, that's still better than

501
00:31:42,355 --> 00:31:46,075
Speaker 7:  doing nothing. Yeah. So you're still winning like in, in that, in that respect.

502
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:49,865
Speaker 7:  So like, really the key to fitness is to, to make it easy.

503
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:54,585
Speaker 7:  Just make it easy and make it fun. Like find a thing that's fun

504
00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:58,545
Speaker 7:  and find a thing that's easy. If you enjoy doing walks, listening to audio

505
00:31:58,555 --> 00:32:02,545
Speaker 7:  books, just do that. Hmm. Just do that. You do not have to like

506
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:06,025
Speaker 7:  run a marathon. That's, that's crazy. Like I, I haven't run a marathon yet

507
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:09,625
Speaker 7:  and I run a lot. So like, you don't have to do that if that's not for you.

508
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:14,425
Speaker 7:  A lot of people will say like, oh, the habit building the habit is hard.

509
00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:18,225
Speaker 7:  Like the consistency is what these tools are for. Yes. But

510
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:21,425
Speaker 7:  you cannot be consistent unless you find the thing that you like. So find

511
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:25,145
Speaker 7:  the thing that you like first. Like that's, I mean it's it, all these tech

512
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:28,105
Speaker 7:  companies are gonna yell at me because I'm basically saying, your tools are

513
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:32,065
Speaker 7:  shit. But it's, it's, it's honestly what you're

514
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:34,865
Speaker 7:  doing is you're building the wisdom to use the tools effectively because

515
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:38,785
Speaker 7:  they're tools and you're gonna fall, you are gonna fall

516
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:41,905
Speaker 7:  into the trap of being obsessed with streaks. Break them, just break them

517
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:44,785
Speaker 7:  on purpose. Right? Break them on purpose and forgive yourself for breaking

518
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:48,625
Speaker 7:  them on purpose. If your exercise is supernatural in a VR headset, do

519
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:52,385
Speaker 7:  it. Do it. Play dance, dance. I know people who have lost 50 pounds just

520
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:55,105
Speaker 7:  going to the arcade and playing dance. Dance revolution. Yep. Do it. That's

521
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:59,145
Speaker 7:  exercise. It counts. Like have fun. It shouldn't be

522
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,625
Speaker 7:  work. It really should not be work. It should be something that does not

523
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:06,155
Speaker 7:  feel like work. Like for me, running, running is now

524
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:09,675
Speaker 7:  like a time where I get to think about a draft that is

525
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:13,835
Speaker 7:  bothering me. Mm. And like working out some stuff in my

526
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:17,755
Speaker 7:  head and it, it always works. Or like it's a time if I do have to go

527
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:21,715
Speaker 7:  to the dread, the dread mill is what I call it. I have a YouTube playlist

528
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:25,435
Speaker 7:  of K-pop videos. I haven't gotten around to watching. I get to watch K-pop

529
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:29,405
Speaker 7:  videos while I suffer. And that's a way that

530
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:31,445
Speaker 7:  you can make fitness more tolerable.

531
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:35,565
Speaker 2:  One of the best things I ever did was I had a show that I only allowed myself

532
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:39,365
Speaker 2:  to watch at the gym. Yes. It was just, I just decided this, I I

533
00:33:39,395 --> 00:33:42,205
Speaker 2:  love the show and I'm watching it and I'm only allowed to watch it at the

534
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:46,085
Speaker 2:  gym. And the problem was, there weren't that many episodes

535
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:49,045
Speaker 2:  in the show, so I literally fell off as soon as the show ended. But it was

536
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:53,085
Speaker 2:  a surprisingly good way to a get

537
00:33:53,085 --> 00:33:55,045
Speaker 2:  me there. 'cause I was like, oh, I like this show. I'm enjoying it. I'm,

538
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:58,085
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna go to the gym so I can watch it. And b it kept me on the treadmill

539
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:00,845
Speaker 2:  for longer. I just like had it on the iPad and I would watch, I would run

540
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,885
Speaker 2:  for a whole episode. And that was like that, that became part of

541
00:34:04,885 --> 00:34:08,005
Speaker 2:  the process and I, I really enjoyed that. So like that little, that little

542
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,165
Speaker 2:  carrot for me was really productive.

543
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:15,285
Speaker 7:  Also allowed to quit. You are allowed If you don't en it's like

544
00:34:16,115 --> 00:34:20,005
Speaker 7:  readers will say this about DN fing books. Don't waste your time on

545
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:23,885
Speaker 7:  an activity that you don't enjoy. Like you wouldn't spend all

546
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:27,845
Speaker 7:  that time trying to read freaking gravity's rainbow by t. Like I, I regret

547
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:31,605
Speaker 7:  reading that book. I hated it from like, clearly I hated it 200 pages

548
00:34:31,665 --> 00:34:35,525
Speaker 7:  in, I forced myself to get through like the rest of the 800 page

549
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:38,925
Speaker 7:  book. But like those 600 pages I could have spent reading something enjoyable

550
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:42,725
Speaker 7:  that I liked. So I regret powering through that. The same thing with

551
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:45,645
Speaker 7:  exercise. Okay, you don't like running, don't do it. You don't like strength

552
00:34:45,885 --> 00:34:49,725
Speaker 7:  training, don't do it. Maybe what you're thing is, is rock

553
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:53,725
Speaker 7:  climbing. Do that. And you know, some people will say that, I'm

554
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:57,445
Speaker 7:  telling you bad health advice just because there's benefits to strength

555
00:34:57,725 --> 00:35:01,485
Speaker 7:  training, your muscles will atrophy as you grow older, yada yada

556
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:03,925
Speaker 7:  yada. What I found because I hated strength training, was that I wanted to

557
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:07,605
Speaker 7:  get faster at running. So now I do strength training because I wanna get

558
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,925
Speaker 7:  faster at running. It took me a really long time to get to that point, like

559
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:13,485
Speaker 7:  a really, really long time to get to that point. And that's okay. You'll

560
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:17,165
Speaker 7:  get to it eventually. It's fine. Just, it's fine. Maybe, maybe you like Pilates,

561
00:35:17,545 --> 00:35:20,645
Speaker 7:  God, god bless you. Pilates people are a different breed of crazy

562
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:22,405
Speaker 2:  Pilates freaks me out. Yeah. Can't do

563
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:25,365
Speaker 7:  It. Like they're, they're a different breed of like, I, I was doing it for

564
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:29,285
Speaker 7:  a while and I've decided to quit. Like I decided to quit. Like, you're allowed

565
00:35:29,285 --> 00:35:32,805
Speaker 7:  to quit If you don't like it, just quit. Find something else. Try something

566
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:36,755
Speaker 7:  else like walking. Just if walking is all

567
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:40,685
Speaker 7:  you do, just walk. Just walk walking's great. Like make it easy. Make it

568
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:40,845
Speaker 7:  fun.

569
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:45,445
Speaker 2:  I I like this. Okay. One, I, I have a recommendation that I just wanna

570
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:47,645
Speaker 2:  throw out 'cause this is a thing that I did last year that has worked very

571
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,605
Speaker 2:  well for me. And then I have one more question for you. The single best fitness

572
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:54,565
Speaker 2:  thing I did last year was by one single dumbbell

573
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:58,805
Speaker 2:  I bought. I, I just have sitting next to me at my desk, a a

574
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:02,725
Speaker 2:  25 pound dumbbell and have discovered that

575
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:07,165
Speaker 2:  with one weight and 15 minutes you can do a shockingly

576
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:10,685
Speaker 2:  complete workout. And it has been really useful for me as just like a thing

577
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:14,405
Speaker 2:  where if, if I'm like feeling tense or itchy or whatever, I can just like

578
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:17,725
Speaker 2:  stand up and, and work out for just like a couple of minutes and it helps.

579
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,565
Speaker 2:  It's not a full workout. No one is going to accuse me of being

580
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:25,125
Speaker 2:  shredded. But it is like that, that is a thing that like to your point of

581
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:28,045
Speaker 2:  like making it easy, I made that specific piece of working out really, really

582
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:31,605
Speaker 2:  easy and it really helped. And the like, Amazon basic

583
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:35,285
Speaker 2:  dumbbells are very cheap and the box is hilariously heavy and

584
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:39,725
Speaker 2:  I, I recommend everybody doing that. My last question to you before

585
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:43,525
Speaker 2:  I let you go is for people who are kind of like one level up

586
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:47,645
Speaker 2:  from just sort of learning how many steps they take in a day

587
00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:51,045
Speaker 2:  and I'm like, I want to exercise more, I wanna be more consistent. I think

588
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:54,445
Speaker 2:  a lot of those people are looking for a place

589
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:58,965
Speaker 2:  to manage that, right? Like a, an app or a smartwatch

590
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:02,885
Speaker 2:  or like maybe the answer is a piece of paper or something. Like I, I am a

591
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:06,325
Speaker 2:  person who exercises a little and I wanna be a little more regimented and

592
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:10,085
Speaker 2:  intentional about exercising more. Where would you point

593
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:10,765
Speaker 2:  those people?

594
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:15,765
Speaker 7:  So unfortunately a lot of it is based on what you wanna

595
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:19,645
Speaker 7:  do. Like If you like strengths training, I really love the latter

596
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:23,605
Speaker 7:  app. It's what stuck with me because my, my problem

597
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:27,205
Speaker 7:  with strengths training and why I put it off for so long was I didn't know

598
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:30,965
Speaker 7:  what I was supposed to do. Like I wanted to strengths train as a runner.

599
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:35,405
Speaker 7:  I didn't know what exercises to do. I don't know how long to do it for. I

600
00:37:35,405 --> 00:37:38,725
Speaker 7:  can turn my brain off with this app and it's great because

601
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:43,085
Speaker 7:  they have six week progressive overload programs and then a two week

602
00:37:43,085 --> 00:37:46,245
Speaker 7:  break and they just repeat that ad in Finit. There's different

603
00:37:46,775 --> 00:37:50,165
Speaker 7:  types of strengths training programs in there. So I'm in Move well, which

604
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:54,085
Speaker 7:  is like for beginners and it focuses on movements that are good

605
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:58,005
Speaker 7:  for runners. So it's like perfect and wow, I got faster at running. Oh my

606
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:01,445
Speaker 7:  God. And then that success kept me going. But if you're someone who wants

607
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:05,325
Speaker 7:  to get shredded, they have those things for people at the gym who are doing

608
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,765
Speaker 7:  the Scary Smith Mach, like all that sort of stuff. They have those programs

609
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:12,085
Speaker 7:  for you too. Different teams, If you're a yoga person and a

610
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:15,405
Speaker 7:  Pilates person, they have strength things that incorporate that. So there's

611
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:18,565
Speaker 7:  just like a bunch of different things that you can go to. I think if you're

612
00:38:18,565 --> 00:38:21,965
Speaker 7:  a beginner or intermediate and you just don't wanna think about crafting

613
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:25,765
Speaker 7:  your own program or hiring a personal trainer, that's a great app.

614
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:29,605
Speaker 7:  It's been working for me. I love it. If you are

615
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:33,445
Speaker 7:  a runner, I think any running app

616
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:37,285
Speaker 7:  and you can like do research, I use Runkeeper. They have like little

617
00:38:37,485 --> 00:38:40,205
Speaker 7:  training programs so they're like, oh, here's my goal, here's what I wanna

618
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:43,965
Speaker 7:  do. It generates a little training program for me based on weeks. And that's

619
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:47,445
Speaker 7:  how I've trained for marathon half marathons. And

620
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:50,285
Speaker 7:  my current goal of doing 5K,

621
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:55,765
Speaker 7:  basically I tell it how many days I wanna run what

622
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:59,725
Speaker 7:  my time goal is. And I wanna say after a really

623
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:03,685
Speaker 7:  solid seven month training block last year I

624
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:07,165
Speaker 7:  reduced my four mile time by 16 minutes. Good,

625
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:07,765
Speaker 2:  Good work. Which

626
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:12,245
Speaker 7:  Insane. And like I was showing up and like once you start

627
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:15,245
Speaker 7:  getting progress it gets a addictive. And I was like, oh

628
00:39:16,275 --> 00:39:20,095
Speaker 7:  yay. Like that's there for me. Like I don't have to think about like

629
00:39:20,205 --> 00:39:23,855
Speaker 7:  what kind of exercises and training I'm gonna do. It's all,

630
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:27,855
Speaker 7:  there's speed work in there, there's tempo runs in there, there's long runs

631
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:31,655
Speaker 7:  in there and there are so many different apps that do that. For runners specifically,

632
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:34,175
Speaker 7:  there's Run. Yeah, there's Nike Run club. So just pick

633
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:36,735
Speaker 2:  One. I'm gonna get emails for saying this. Yeah. But I think the running

634
00:39:36,735 --> 00:39:39,495
Speaker 2:  apps are like a dime a dozen. They

635
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:40,015
Speaker 7:  Are, they

636
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:43,615
Speaker 2:  Are pick pick the one that is like start with one that's free. A because

637
00:39:43,655 --> 00:39:47,295
Speaker 2:  a lot of these will try to make you pay very quickly and B, just

638
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:51,295
Speaker 2:  pick one. That seems fine. Right? Like there, there for like a

639
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:55,295
Speaker 2:  straightforward running plan. It's there are a million out there that will

640
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:55,655
Speaker 2:  work for you.

641
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:59,775
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Now pick one that like a chill friend of yours is on.

642
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:03,575
Speaker 7:  That's the key. Like my chill friend was on Runkeeper, so now we just like,

643
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:06,095
Speaker 7:  like each other's activities and it's nice. That's smart.

644
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:10,215
Speaker 2:  The couch to 5K one I use by the way is called five K Runner and

645
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:13,335
Speaker 2:  I like it very much and it has one of those AI coaches that at the end of

646
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:15,975
Speaker 2:  every run is like, you did such a good job. And I'm like, you're lying. Yeah.

647
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:19,055
Speaker 2:  I walked most of this and it's like, that's, I'm so proud of you. Oh's fine.

648
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:20,295
Speaker 2:  You're terrific. See you in a couple days.

649
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:23,735
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna tell you, in most races that I've ever run, there are plenty of

650
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:27,455
Speaker 7:  people walking. So yeah, the idea that you have to do a long race

651
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:31,495
Speaker 7:  and just completely walk the entire time is bullshit. It's just bullshit.

652
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:35,095
Speaker 7:  You can, you can take a walk break, many professional runners take walk breaks.

653
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:38,175
Speaker 7:  It's very normal to do that. But yeah, so

654
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:42,655
Speaker 7:  find whatever. There's so much out there. Like I will continue to write about

655
00:40:42,655 --> 00:40:46,215
Speaker 7:  the ones that I find that I like that helped me because I am

656
00:40:46,895 --> 00:40:50,775
Speaker 7:  absolutely not the crazy, like DC Rainmaker

657
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:54,255
Speaker 7:  is a really nice guy. I love his stuff. I could never do what he does. And

658
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:58,215
Speaker 7:  I think most of us are in that boat. We're just normal

659
00:40:58,215 --> 00:41:01,305
Speaker 7:  people trying to be relatively

660
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:06,345
Speaker 7:  not dying as a couch potato. And, and,

661
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:10,185
Speaker 7:  and because of that, you are not an Olympian. You do not have to do what

662
00:41:10,185 --> 00:41:14,025
Speaker 7:  Olympians do. You don't, that doesn't make any sense. So

663
00:41:14,025 --> 00:41:17,905
Speaker 7:  just, just relax. I really love your dumbbell hack though

664
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:21,665
Speaker 7:  because I think that's exactly the type of thing that counts.

665
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:25,945
Speaker 7:  Like, and most exercise research will say like you doing that

666
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:29,945
Speaker 7:  is probably like elongating your, your longevity

667
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:33,805
Speaker 7:  in your life by like an amount that is stupidly high

668
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:37,765
Speaker 7:  proportional of the work that you're putting in. It is, it's just like, yeah,

669
00:41:37,885 --> 00:41:41,805
Speaker 7:  I think, I think walking five flights of stairs a day is enough to like

670
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:46,005
Speaker 7:  increase your like cardio health by a crap ton. Like you just have to

671
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:48,965
Speaker 7:  do five staircases a day. That's it most, that's doable for most people.

672
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:54,445
Speaker 7:  So yeah, it's just do, just do small, do small things. Don't make your goal

673
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:56,965
Speaker 7:  get shredded by June. Make your goal, get shredded by

674
00:41:56,965 --> 00:42:00,685
Speaker 7:  June, 2040. Like, like, or something like that.

675
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:04,005
Speaker 7:  That's, that's actually my goal. My goal is to get shredded in four years

676
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:07,845
Speaker 7:  for my 40th. So that's it. That's it. I love that. I'm not doing it, I'm

677
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:11,165
Speaker 7:  not doing it in a year, I'm doing it in four years. Like that's, that's kind

678
00:42:11,165 --> 00:42:12,725
Speaker 7:  of the the energy you need to have.

679
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:16,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. I know. I I keep harping on this. Like, it it, the, there are

680
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:20,525
Speaker 2:  people who do this as a lifestyle thing and that's like, I feel like it's

681
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:23,885
Speaker 2:  useful to remember that that is, that is like a hundred on the zero to a

682
00:42:23,885 --> 00:42:27,725
Speaker 2:  hundred scale. We treat it as like a zero and a one. Right. Like either

683
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:31,605
Speaker 2:  yeah, you're a couch potato who's gonna die in three days

684
00:42:32,065 --> 00:42:35,685
Speaker 2:  or running is your life. Yeah. And like no, there's actually,

685
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:39,405
Speaker 2:  there's so much in between and you can just, there

686
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:43,125
Speaker 2:  there's, there are literally huge benefits to going from a zero

687
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,805
Speaker 2:  to a one or from a five to a six or from a 25 to a

688
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:50,125
Speaker 2:  26. Yeah. Like that's, and that's the way I've, I've tried to learn how to

689
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:54,085
Speaker 2:  think about this is like, don't, I don't need to become quote unquote a

690
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:58,045
Speaker 2:  runner. I'm just gonna go for a run that's, that's I'm gonna go

691
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:02,005
Speaker 2:  for a run and if I like it, maybe I'll run tomorrow and if not, I

692
00:43:02,005 --> 00:43:04,045
Speaker 2:  don't know. I'll play more supernatural. It'll be fine.

693
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:07,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Like I, you know, I went to CESI brought four sets of workout clothes

694
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,845
Speaker 7:  and I was like, if I do one that's a success. I did two. So I

695
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:14,605
Speaker 7:  super succeeded. Like that's, that's how it goes. And like,

696
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,885
Speaker 2:  I appreciate the optimism of four outfits for it though.

697
00:43:17,205 --> 00:43:20,605
Speaker 7:  I, yeah, it was very optimistic, but I was just like,

698
00:43:20,985 --> 00:43:24,925
Speaker 7:  it was very optimistic. But I went for two, which I thought I was gonna

699
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:27,805
Speaker 7:  go for zero. I went for two. I fricking crushed it.

700
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:33,565
Speaker 7:  Like it's, it's snowing outside. I can't go for a four

701
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:37,205
Speaker 7:  mile run right now like I normally would. I'm gonna go for a

702
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:40,965
Speaker 7:  shitty, not very great run on a treadmill.

703
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:44,085
Speaker 7:  You know what, I'm crushing it. That's all that is. That's all it is. Just

704
00:43:44,085 --> 00:43:47,885
Speaker 7:  like give yourself a participation trophy. Like

705
00:43:47,885 --> 00:43:51,565
Speaker 7:  that's it. That's it. You don't need to win a gold medal, just get the participation

706
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:51,805
Speaker 7:  trophy.

707
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:54,525
Speaker 2:  Do you wanna know the best thing I this, I had not thought of this until

708
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:57,645
Speaker 2:  just now, but as you're talking about this, when my now wife and I first

709
00:43:57,645 --> 00:44:00,685
Speaker 2:  started dating, she was a big runner and she got me to run with her

710
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:05,685
Speaker 2:  by always running to donuts. We, we found, found, there you go. We were

711
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,965
Speaker 2:  living in New York and we, we would just run to different donut shops all

712
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:10,205
Speaker 2:  over New York,

713
00:44:11,745 --> 00:44:14,685
Speaker 2:  the single most consistently I have ever run. And part of it was because

714
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,885
Speaker 2:  like I liked her and wanted her to like me, but I also got to run to donuts

715
00:44:17,915 --> 00:44:21,805
Speaker 2:  nuts. And I'm convinced that I ran faster and longer and more consistently

716
00:44:22,465 --> 00:44:26,405
Speaker 2:  to donuts than I have ever run in my life. So like you

717
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:29,245
Speaker 2:  get your participation trophy. I get donuts, everybody wins.

718
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:33,525
Speaker 7:  The the donut is the participation trophy. Yes. Is what I'm saying. It's

719
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:36,645
Speaker 7:  perfect. Like just whatever your participation trophy is, go get it because

720
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:37,725
Speaker 7:  Love it. That's all you need.

721
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:40,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I love it. All right vi thank you as always.

722
00:44:40,615 --> 00:44:41,085
Speaker 7:  Thank you.

723
00:44:42,705 --> 00:44:45,525
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break, but then we're gonna come back and we're

724
00:44:45,525 --> 00:44:45,605
Speaker 2:  gonna

725
00:46:24,775 --> 00:46:28,435
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So a couple of weeks ago, a group at a

726
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:32,355
Speaker 2:  university in Finland launched this thing called The Nokia Design

727
00:46:32,355 --> 00:46:36,235
Speaker 2:  Archive. And basically it is thousands of old

728
00:46:36,635 --> 00:46:40,275
Speaker 2:  documents from Nokia from like the early

729
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:44,315
Speaker 2:  two thousands all the way back into the nineties. And If you

730
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:47,995
Speaker 2:  don't remember, Nokia was the cell phone industry

731
00:46:48,255 --> 00:46:52,075
Speaker 2:  at the time. In a very real way, this was like the biggest, most successful

732
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:55,835
Speaker 2:  company in the early days of cell phones. And inside

733
00:46:55,835 --> 00:46:59,395
Speaker 2:  this design Archive right now it's 755 documents

734
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:03,395
Speaker 2:  all about just the design and thinking

735
00:47:03,895 --> 00:47:07,715
Speaker 2:  inside of that company about what phones should be. And there's all

736
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:10,715
Speaker 2:  kinds of truly incredible stuff in there. You go through and there's tons

737
00:47:10,715 --> 00:47:14,475
Speaker 2:  of different just lifestyle images of like two

738
00:47:14,725 --> 00:47:18,715
Speaker 2:  dudes sitting on a tennis court and one of them is talking on his

739
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:21,355
Speaker 2:  phone. And it's the kind of thing that now is like, that's just a picture

740
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:25,235
Speaker 2:  of two people. But that picture's from the nineties when it was

741
00:47:25,295 --> 00:47:29,285
Speaker 2:  not common for two dudes sitting on a tennis court

742
00:47:29,465 --> 00:47:33,045
Speaker 2:  to have cell phones in addition to all of the promotional

743
00:47:33,445 --> 00:47:37,285
Speaker 2:  materials. There are tons of concepts. I think if, If you do one thing in

744
00:47:37,285 --> 00:47:40,925
Speaker 2:  this design Archive, you should go through and look at some of the

745
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:43,885
Speaker 2:  concepts. And there are concepts for all kinds of things. Some of them are

746
00:47:44,145 --> 00:47:47,805
Speaker 2:  phones, right? Like Nokia had big ideas about how phones

747
00:47:47,855 --> 00:47:51,845
Speaker 2:  maybe should be squishy or how phones should maybe

748
00:47:51,985 --> 00:47:55,445
Speaker 2:  be modular. There were lots of different ideas about what if a phone was

749
00:47:55,445 --> 00:47:59,245
Speaker 2:  just a little kind of candy bar shaped thing that you could stick into

750
00:47:59,245 --> 00:48:03,085
Speaker 2:  lots of different sorts of cases and maybe where, or have an

751
00:48:03,185 --> 00:48:07,085
Speaker 2:  FM radio on top of, or any number of things. There's one that I

752
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:10,885
Speaker 2:  really like that's called Moonraker, and it was a Nokia smartwatch that never

753
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:14,645
Speaker 2:  made it on the market, never got shipped, but it's just an Apple watch.

754
00:48:14,795 --> 00:48:18,765
Speaker 2:  Like I don't, I don't know how else to put it. It has a vertical ui, it looks

755
00:48:18,765 --> 00:48:22,245
Speaker 2:  like an Apple watch. It's kind of a mix of the Apple Watch

756
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:26,845
Speaker 2:  and like the tile look of Windows eight.

757
00:48:27,455 --> 00:48:31,125
Speaker 2:  Maybe that combination is not a super good idea, but it,

758
00:48:31,195 --> 00:48:34,605
Speaker 2:  it's just fascinating. This is in 2014, so it's not like Nokia is, you know,

759
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:38,405
Speaker 2:  a million miles ahead of what Apple is doing. But everybody was thinking

760
00:48:38,405 --> 00:48:41,045
Speaker 2:  about this stuff and one of the things that I think is so interesting about

761
00:48:41,045 --> 00:48:44,565
Speaker 2:  all of this is to see how much

762
00:48:44,985 --> 00:48:48,845
Speaker 2:  of what's going on in tech is actually going on everywhere. And the big

763
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:51,765
Speaker 2:  question is like how are these things supposed to work and how are you going

764
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:55,605
Speaker 2:  to use them and what do they mean in your life? One other thing you should

765
00:48:55,605 --> 00:48:59,565
Speaker 2:  check out is called P-Tech clothing. That was one of these big modular

766
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:03,285
Speaker 2:  ideas that Nokia had and they had this idea that

767
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:07,045
Speaker 2:  maybe you'd wear your phone on a lanyard around

768
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:10,605
Speaker 2:  your neck and you'd have one that was like cool and Gucci

769
00:49:10,955 --> 00:49:14,525
Speaker 2:  made during the day, but then you'd have one that was like rubbery and sporty

770
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:18,445
Speaker 2:  that you'd wear when you were, you know, out on the go. Nokia had so many

771
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:22,525
Speaker 2:  interesting ideas about how people would use phones

772
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:26,325
Speaker 2:  and I think that's really cool and it's not the kind of thing you see now

773
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:29,445
Speaker 2:  where everybody is trying to sell phones to, you know, 3 billion people all

774
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:33,165
Speaker 2:  over the earth. Now You see all these companies who are trying to sell phones

775
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:36,725
Speaker 2:  to, you know, billions of people at a time. And so we've gotten to the point

776
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:40,685
Speaker 2:  where so many phones in particular have just hit

777
00:49:40,685 --> 00:49:44,405
Speaker 2:  kind of a lowest common denominator. I don't mean that as an insult,

778
00:49:44,405 --> 00:49:48,325
Speaker 2:  they're just not different anymore. Even If you and I buy

779
00:49:48,325 --> 00:49:52,085
Speaker 2:  different phones, you buy a Samsung phone, I buy an iPhone, you buy a

780
00:49:52,145 --> 00:49:55,885
Speaker 2:  Huawei phone, I buy a one plus phone. They're just

781
00:49:56,045 --> 00:49:59,085
Speaker 2:  slabs of glass at this point. They all have cameras in basically the same

782
00:49:59,085 --> 00:50:02,285
Speaker 2:  place. They all do basically the same thing. And it's really fun to go in

783
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:05,805
Speaker 2:  and see Nokia reckoning with this idea of how do we change

784
00:50:05,935 --> 00:50:09,805
Speaker 2:  everything? And there's this sense of like, phones aren't inevitably

785
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:13,885
Speaker 2:  this one thing. Like there's no sense inside of Nokia that they're building

786
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,645
Speaker 2:  towards this one specific platonic idea of a smartphone.

787
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:22,045
Speaker 2:  Instead they're just like, what if our phones kind of

788
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:26,005
Speaker 2:  looked like gaming handheld consoles? And then they have one that's

789
00:50:26,005 --> 00:50:29,845
Speaker 2:  called Hitchhiker that is like a prop from a sci-fi

790
00:50:29,845 --> 00:50:33,765
Speaker 2:  movie with the, the keys on the side and the screen in the middle. That one

791
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:37,725
Speaker 2:  actually was very cool and it's code named Hitchhiker, which I think absolutely

792
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:41,725
Speaker 2:  rules. Nokia had so many ideas about technology and I found

793
00:50:41,725 --> 00:50:45,565
Speaker 2:  myself going through this wondering how unusual this

794
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:49,445
Speaker 2:  company really was. I think over the course of 20 years we get to see

795
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:53,085
Speaker 2:  all of this information and these concepts and these

796
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:56,965
Speaker 2:  presentations in which Nokia just tries to invent the future

797
00:50:57,105 --> 00:51:00,965
Speaker 2:  in a thousand different directions. And maybe that's what

798
00:51:00,965 --> 00:51:04,885
Speaker 2:  every company is doing, but maybe not. And maybe the

799
00:51:04,885 --> 00:51:08,725
Speaker 2:  fact that we have glass slabs of smartphones is a

800
00:51:08,725 --> 00:51:12,685
Speaker 2:  sign that we need more of this, more weird ideas, more trying to invent

801
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:16,245
Speaker 2:  the future in a thousand different directions all at the same time. I find

802
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:19,245
Speaker 2:  this whole Archive fascinating and I really think if you're listening to

803
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:23,165
Speaker 2:  this podcast, you are the kind of person who should go and just poke around

804
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:25,965
Speaker 2:  it for 20 minutes. You will find something you've never seen in here before.

805
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:29,965
Speaker 2:  I absolutely guarantee it and I truly cannot recommend

806
00:51:29,995 --> 00:51:33,965
Speaker 2:  just poking around and looking at some of these different concepts. Enough.

807
00:51:34,115 --> 00:51:37,365
Speaker 2:  I'll put a few of them in the show notes because frankly just everyone should

808
00:51:37,365 --> 00:51:41,125
Speaker 2:  see these, but it's a really good time. All that said,

809
00:51:41,645 --> 00:51:44,845
Speaker 2:  I knew immediately after getting into this that I wanted to talk to somebody

810
00:51:44,845 --> 00:51:48,005
Speaker 2:  who actually worked on this and has seen all of these materials and can help

811
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:51,925
Speaker 2:  me make some sense of the story behind all this stuff. So

812
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:55,165
Speaker 2:  I called up Anna Altan, who is one of the researchers who actually put this

813
00:51:55,165 --> 00:51:58,645
Speaker 2:  whole Archive together. She is a professor at Alto

814
00:51:58,645 --> 00:52:02,285
Speaker 2:  University, which is where this Archive is being held. She also worked at

815
00:52:02,335 --> 00:52:06,325
Speaker 2:  Nokia in the design department for a long time. She's seen all sides of this

816
00:52:06,345 --> 00:52:09,565
Speaker 2:  and knows this space better than just about anybody. So I figured I'd have

817
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:13,165
Speaker 2:  her just bring me through the Archive a little bit and help me see if we

818
00:52:13,165 --> 00:52:17,085
Speaker 2:  can figure out what lessons to learn. So let's just dive in. I

819
00:52:17,085 --> 00:52:20,885
Speaker 2:  started by asking Ana to just explain her history a little bit and how

820
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:23,525
Speaker 2:  in particular she got started at Nokia.

821
00:52:24,235 --> 00:52:27,485
Speaker 15:  Okay, well I started at Nokia a long time ago. I was

822
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:31,725
Speaker 15:  recently graduated, it was in the mid nineties or late nineties. So then

823
00:52:31,725 --> 00:52:35,445
Speaker 15:  I worked there as in the design organization, it all sorts of different

824
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:39,405
Speaker 15:  kinds of roles for a good 12 or 13 years. But this project

825
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:43,765
Speaker 15:  actually started a lot later than that. So when I was still working

826
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:47,205
Speaker 15:  back in Nokia, we used to keep store, you know, things in

827
00:52:47,525 --> 00:52:51,045
Speaker 15:  archived in a, in a big room in the basement of the new headquarters at

828
00:52:51,045 --> 00:52:54,725
Speaker 15:  the time. But then when I started doing research

829
00:52:54,725 --> 00:52:58,605
Speaker 15:  around this, I was really focusing on what do designers do and how do

830
00:52:58,605 --> 00:53:02,565
Speaker 15:  they work and so on. So I was quite keen on on getting all the, the

831
00:53:02,765 --> 00:53:06,285
Speaker 15:  material from there. And eventually we did when by the time

832
00:53:06,495 --> 00:53:10,365
Speaker 15:  Nokia had sort of sold off its phone activities to Microsoft

833
00:53:10,365 --> 00:53:14,005
Speaker 15:  and Microsoft was going to move out from Finland with their

834
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:17,965
Speaker 15:  phone design or I'm not even sure if they were going to continue doing phone

835
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:21,845
Speaker 15:  designs at all at the time. So we got the stuff and we,

836
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:25,725
Speaker 15:  we pulled it all over to the Alto archives or

837
00:53:25,725 --> 00:53:28,805
Speaker 15:  basically a storage room to start with. We didn't really know what to do

838
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:29,085
Speaker 15:  with it

839
00:53:30,685 --> 00:53:33,845
Speaker 15:  'cause it was a lot and it was, it was not very, you know, it wasn't organized

840
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:37,805
Speaker 15:  so it was big boxes with all sorts of things mashed up together. So

841
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:41,165
Speaker 15:  after a while we got a research project around it, got some funding so we

842
00:53:41,165 --> 00:53:45,045
Speaker 15:  could hire people and hands and start documenting what we

843
00:53:45,045 --> 00:53:48,525
Speaker 15:  had and put them in order and, and start understanding what relates to to

844
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:52,325
Speaker 15:  what and so on. And, and we've been an a really wonderful

845
00:53:52,585 --> 00:53:56,245
Speaker 15:  transdisciplinary team working with that material for a good four years

846
00:53:56,305 --> 00:53:57,005
Speaker 15:  now. Okay.

847
00:53:57,305 --> 00:54:00,925
Speaker 2:  So what was your sense at the beginning of what might be

848
00:54:01,185 --> 00:54:03,805
Speaker 2:  inside of this trove of stuff?

849
00:54:04,845 --> 00:54:08,575
Speaker 15:  There's all sorts. There's everything from sketches to

850
00:54:09,335 --> 00:54:13,175
Speaker 15:  physical mockups, early stage mockups, very early sketchy kind of mockups

851
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:17,015
Speaker 15:  and very finalized products or, or products close to launch. There's

852
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:21,095
Speaker 15:  documentation of, of what happened while people were working on these

853
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:25,375
Speaker 15:  ideas and so on. And I think to me at least they really, all

854
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:28,975
Speaker 15:  the material it shows the work that goes on behind a

855
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:32,895
Speaker 15:  finalized product or before you get that far. So can you use

856
00:54:32,915 --> 00:54:36,855
Speaker 15:  design to start thinking of what could be or, or you know, provoke a

857
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:40,535
Speaker 15:  discussion of should we maybe be doing that or, or use it

858
00:54:40,635 --> 00:54:44,575
Speaker 15:  for understanding what will people like or what would be important for them

859
00:54:44,635 --> 00:54:48,415
Speaker 15:  or create a discussion and a debate around, you know, could we do something

860
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:52,295
Speaker 15:  completely new or different? And that's sort of what I'm hoping that

861
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:56,135
Speaker 15:  the Archive will do now when it's open for, for, for anyone

862
00:54:56,155 --> 00:55:00,055
Speaker 15:  to, to dive in is if it creates or generates more of an

863
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:04,015
Speaker 15:  imagination of what could be or gets us to think of how could we

864
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:07,735
Speaker 15:  tackle these things that we don't quite know what they are yet. And, and

865
00:55:08,195 --> 00:55:12,175
Speaker 15:  you know, in a sense I think we're in a similar situation now with new technology

866
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:16,255
Speaker 15:  AI coming and no one quite knows what it will be or how

867
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:19,535
Speaker 15:  it will be concrete in in our lives. So

868
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:23,895
Speaker 15:  we could at least imagine and we could try stuff and we could test it and

869
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:24,735
Speaker 15:  we can see what works.

870
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:28,015
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. It, it's, I'm glad you brought that up because that was one of

871
00:55:28,015 --> 00:55:31,375
Speaker 2:  the things that struck me most going through the Archive is there's this

872
00:55:31,445 --> 00:55:35,135
Speaker 2:  real sense of questioning what a smartphone

873
00:55:35,315 --> 00:55:39,295
Speaker 2:  is supposed to be and what technology is supposed to be and how we're

874
00:55:39,735 --> 00:55:43,015
Speaker 2:  supposed to hold it and use it. And Nokia was obsessed with this idea of

875
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:47,055
Speaker 2:  like gadgets that go into little containers that change the features of those

876
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:49,975
Speaker 2:  gadgets. The, like, it just seemed like every designer at Nokia had some

877
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:52,935
Speaker 2:  idea about, you know, these modular gadgets.

878
00:55:54,205 --> 00:55:58,095
Speaker 2:  Like do you remember those kinds of conversations back then when, when it

879
00:55:58,095 --> 00:56:01,975
Speaker 2:  wasn't so obvious to everybody what a smartphone was? I think we think about

880
00:56:01,975 --> 00:56:05,895
Speaker 2:  it now as sort of inevitable that like, this is what a smartphone

881
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,255
Speaker 2:  is, it's a slab of glass.

882
00:56:08,975 --> 00:56:11,615
Speaker 2:  I don't think it was inevitable and I don't, and I think there were, there

883
00:56:11,615 --> 00:56:15,495
Speaker 2:  were so many different ideas back then, like does it, does it bring

884
00:56:15,495 --> 00:56:17,655
Speaker 2:  up some of those questions again to look at all these things now?

885
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:22,385
Speaker 15:  It was far from inevitable. There were so many, I remember many of

886
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:24,965
Speaker 15:  the discussions, one I remember particularly well was when

887
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:29,605
Speaker 15:  sometime far in the future there were going to be 3G networks.

888
00:56:30,315 --> 00:56:34,085
Speaker 15:  They might make it possible to send a picture or you could even have a

889
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:37,845
Speaker 15:  video one day and, and some of the concepts were trying to,

890
00:56:38,185 --> 00:56:41,845
Speaker 15:  to make that concrete. So what would it be If you could actually

891
00:56:42,555 --> 00:56:46,125
Speaker 15:  talk with someone so that you would see them at the same time or,

892
00:56:46,465 --> 00:56:50,365
Speaker 15:  or you could send content that would be visual, which today seems

893
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:54,245
Speaker 15:  completely self-evident right? And obvious and we're, we're having this

894
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:57,605
Speaker 15:  discussion today over, you know, we can see each other while we're talking.

895
00:56:57,745 --> 00:56:59,905
Speaker 15:  So a lot has happened.

896
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:04,185
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I think it's just so interesting to think about going back to before

897
00:57:04,285 --> 00:57:08,145
Speaker 2:  all of that stuff was so obvious and these questions of

898
00:57:08,145 --> 00:57:11,745
Speaker 2:  like, what does it mean and, and how are we supposed to use it? And there,

899
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:14,865
Speaker 2:  one of my favorite things in the Archive is all these concept videos that

900
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:17,625
Speaker 2:  are in there that just absolutely don't make any sense. Like there's one

901
00:57:17,755 --> 00:57:20,945
Speaker 2:  where there, there she, she's looking through a thing and there's an owl

902
00:57:20,945 --> 00:57:24,145
Speaker 2:  in it and then all of a sudden there's an owl flying around in a room and

903
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:27,425
Speaker 2:  it's, I, I could not even explain to you what that is about, but there is

904
00:57:27,425 --> 00:57:31,265
Speaker 2:  this open question and I think Nokia was very good

905
00:57:31,265 --> 00:57:34,385
Speaker 2:  at this before almost any other company was thinking about it, about like

906
00:57:34,925 --> 00:57:38,865
Speaker 2:  how the technology that you have and the real world that

907
00:57:38,865 --> 00:57:42,785
Speaker 2:  you're in are supposed to interact. And, and I think

908
00:57:43,215 --> 00:57:46,265
Speaker 2:  just now on the other end of, you know, 20 years of all of us being pulled

909
00:57:46,265 --> 00:57:49,785
Speaker 2:  more and more and more into screens, it was just neat to go back and be like,

910
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:52,545
Speaker 2:  okay, this was, this was a question we had about these are things that should

911
00:57:52,545 --> 00:57:55,985
Speaker 2:  exist in the real world that we should use in the real world

912
00:57:56,445 --> 00:57:59,505
Speaker 2:  and that should interact with the real world. And I, I was just, I was so

913
00:57:59,505 --> 00:58:03,265
Speaker 2:  struck by that way of thinking almost it felt more like science fiction

914
00:58:03,265 --> 00:58:04,865
Speaker 2:  than product design in a lot of ways.

915
00:58:05,855 --> 00:58:08,835
Speaker 15:  But what we're also bringing up is a very important point on the fact that

916
00:58:08,835 --> 00:58:12,475
Speaker 15:  it takes time. That that, you know, there's, there's a long, it could

917
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:16,475
Speaker 15:  be a lot later in, you know, you might have a first idea of something

918
00:58:16,895 --> 00:58:20,355
Speaker 15:  and then it goes through all sorts of levels of product development and

919
00:58:20,355 --> 00:58:24,235
Speaker 15:  ideation and, and further refinement and whatnot. And then you get

920
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:27,115
Speaker 15:  a first product out and that might be years from when you, you know, first

921
00:58:27,115 --> 00:58:30,515
Speaker 15:  were discussing it and then when the first product comes out it might still

922
00:58:30,515 --> 00:58:34,315
Speaker 15:  not make a market or be self-evident

923
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:37,715
Speaker 15:  and then take five years later and everyone thinks that it's quite normal,

924
00:58:38,045 --> 00:58:42,035
Speaker 15:  right? So it's maybe, or at least for me,

925
00:58:42,065 --> 00:58:45,315
Speaker 15:  it's been really wonderful to hear people look at the Archive and they realize,

926
00:58:45,345 --> 00:58:49,195
Speaker 15:  well this looks, you know, normal and then they look at the year and say,

927
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:53,155
Speaker 15:  oh, it was 10 years before it was on the market, or oh it was

928
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:57,275
Speaker 15:  in know 15 years before we thought that was normal. So

929
00:58:57,295 --> 00:59:00,875
Speaker 15:  it shows you or hope, I'm hoping that it will give people the idea of

930
00:59:01,145 --> 00:59:04,905
Speaker 15:  perspective too that yeah, technology doesn't just

931
00:59:04,905 --> 00:59:06,465
Speaker 15:  appear we're actually all creating it.

932
00:59:07,055 --> 00:59:10,665
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What do you think it was about Nokia in particular that so

933
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:14,465
Speaker 2:  many of those things were happening inside of that company

934
00:59:14,645 --> 00:59:18,185
Speaker 2:  so long before they were out in the world? I think to some extent this question

935
00:59:18,185 --> 00:59:21,965
Speaker 2:  of what if we can see each other on video has been on everybody's mind

936
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,565
Speaker 2:  since, you know, a century ago it's, it was, that was kind of an obvious

937
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:29,205
Speaker 2:  thing that would eventually happen, but there's so much of this in the Archive

938
00:59:29,205 --> 00:59:33,125
Speaker 2:  that is just products we have now. And I I think

939
00:59:33,535 --> 00:59:37,005
Speaker 2:  maybe that's true lots of places, but I, I was shocked going through it.

940
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:41,085
Speaker 2:  How much of 2024 and 2025 exists

941
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:44,805
Speaker 2:  in these drawings from like 2000. What do you think it was about

942
00:59:45,055 --> 00:59:46,725
Speaker 2:  Nokia that led to that?

943
00:59:47,185 --> 00:59:51,045
Speaker 15:  That's a very good question and, and it's, it's always easy to to be smart,

944
00:59:51,545 --> 00:59:55,445
Speaker 15:  you know, hindsight, but I do think it was a wonderful working culture

945
00:59:55,545 --> 00:59:59,525
Speaker 15:  of where there was an allowance for testing and for trying things

946
00:59:59,585 --> 01:00:03,365
Speaker 15:  out out and almost an enthusiasm for, for what could be.

947
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:07,605
Speaker 15:  But I also think that many organizations have similar

948
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:12,415
Speaker 15:  activities with them today. It's just that we don't know about it

949
01:00:12,655 --> 01:00:16,215
Speaker 15:  'cause we can't see into other organizations. So

950
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:20,335
Speaker 15:  that's why I'm so happy about this Archive, that it's, it's one glimpse

951
01:00:20,515 --> 01:00:23,695
Speaker 15:  in, into what has happened for real. It's not

952
01:00:24,045 --> 01:00:27,455
Speaker 15:  potential or maybe, or you know, it's, it's actual

953
01:00:27,525 --> 01:00:31,455
Speaker 15:  empirical material of, of things that happened, right? Might miss pieces

954
01:00:31,515 --> 01:00:35,295
Speaker 15:  in between, but at least it's there. The one area that

955
01:00:35,535 --> 01:00:39,455
Speaker 15:  I really like, and this is probably because of my own research

956
01:00:39,475 --> 01:00:43,175
Speaker 15:  and my own background, I really like that it makes the design

957
01:00:43,175 --> 01:00:46,815
Speaker 15:  process very concrete that, that you can really understand

958
01:00:47,205 --> 01:00:50,895
Speaker 15:  what happens in these teams because the teams are often big. They're, they're

959
01:00:50,895 --> 01:00:54,695
Speaker 15:  multidisciplinary, there's a lot of people interacting and so on and, and

960
01:00:54,695 --> 01:00:58,455
Speaker 15:  it's easy to talk about these heroic designers or something like that.

961
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:01,615
Speaker 15:  But, but this Archive actually shows that there's a lot of people involved.

962
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:05,015
Speaker 15:  And what do they actually do? Well, they come up with a mood board or they

963
01:01:05,015 --> 01:01:08,255
Speaker 15:  come up with a sketch or they have a meeting where they talk about this.

964
01:01:09,035 --> 01:01:12,335
Speaker 15:  So, so somehow it's so tangible to me.

965
01:01:13,205 --> 01:01:16,535
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I was struck by how iterative some of this stuff is where

966
01:01:16,905 --> 01:01:20,695
Speaker 2:  there was one I was thinking of where it's a, it's a gaming machine

967
01:01:21,435 --> 01:01:25,375
Speaker 2:  and it, it, it looks a lot like the Nintendo Switch, right? Like there's

968
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,335
Speaker 2:  a, there's a thing, I think it's from, it was either 2000 or 2003, I forget,

969
01:01:28,335 --> 01:01:31,535
Speaker 2:  but it is, it is just straightforwardly a gaming handheld

970
01:01:32,835 --> 01:01:36,695
Speaker 2:  and in it, there is just this one document of basically every imaginable

971
01:01:36,695 --> 01:01:40,255
Speaker 2:  version of a gaming handheld and which I loved very much. It's like, here

972
01:01:40,255 --> 01:01:43,735
Speaker 2:  are the six wild ideas about what this could be. And then you can sort of

973
01:01:43,735 --> 01:01:47,455
Speaker 2:  see over time you, you you winnow it down slightly and then you expand it

974
01:01:47,575 --> 01:01:49,775
Speaker 2:  slightly and then you winnow it down slightly and then you expand it and

975
01:01:49,775 --> 01:01:53,495
Speaker 2:  it's like, that's the design process. Not someone

976
01:01:53,525 --> 01:01:56,615
Speaker 2:  goes into a dark room and comes back fully formed with the Nintendo Switch.

977
01:01:56,645 --> 01:01:59,895
Speaker 2:  It's like, this is how this work actually gets done. And I think you're right

978
01:01:59,895 --> 01:02:03,575
Speaker 2:  that we don't see the way that these things get done because everybody wants

979
01:02:03,575 --> 01:02:06,775
Speaker 2:  to come up at the end and say, here is this beautiful thing that emerged

980
01:02:06,775 --> 01:02:10,695
Speaker 2:  from the earth fully formed and that's just not at all how it

981
01:02:10,695 --> 01:02:11,415
Speaker 2:  ever actually works.

982
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:15,675
Speaker 15:  Yeah, exactly. So I'm hoping that people explore that.

983
01:02:16,485 --> 01:02:20,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it, it was, it was a very fun, I kept going through looking

984
01:02:20,465 --> 01:02:24,365
Speaker 2:  for gadgets that exist now that were in, were being

985
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:27,205
Speaker 2:  talked about back then. And you, you can find 'em everywhere. There's a thing

986
01:02:27,205 --> 01:02:29,885
Speaker 2:  that looks like the Apple watch, there's a thing that looks like the Nintendo

987
01:02:29,885 --> 01:02:33,845
Speaker 2:  Switch. There are every smartphone and PDA that you can imagine. It was very

988
01:02:33,845 --> 01:02:35,085
Speaker 2:  fun. I I enjoyed that frame much.

989
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:39,045
Speaker 15:  There's probably 25 different kinds of smart watches right. From

990
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:41,645
Speaker 15:  different parts of the company and different times and different levels

991
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:44,685
Speaker 15:  of technology and, and you know, different user

992
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:48,245
Speaker 15:  ideas and so on. So it's not one, there's a lot.

993
01:02:48,835 --> 01:02:52,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So the, a lot of the folks listening to this show are, are

994
01:02:53,025 --> 01:02:55,685
Speaker 2:  gadget people. This is what we do at The Verge for gadget people

995
01:02:56,695 --> 01:03:00,645
Speaker 2:  doing all this research. Did you have any, any favorite gadgets or

996
01:03:00,645 --> 01:03:04,445
Speaker 2:  concepts or wild quixotic quests that Nokia

997
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:07,925
Speaker 2:  went on that, that jumped out to you? Any sort of favorite historical artifacts?

998
01:03:08,635 --> 01:03:12,485
Speaker 15:  Many For me, I think the, the most important ones were the

999
01:03:12,485 --> 01:03:16,245
Speaker 15:  ones that I had no idea of Hmm. When I was there because it was a big company

1000
01:03:16,265 --> 01:03:19,365
Speaker 15:  and there's a lot of things happening and going, going on.

1001
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:24,365
Speaker 15:  And also maybe, and let's see if, if what your audience

1002
01:03:24,395 --> 01:03:28,285
Speaker 15:  will think, I think the easy access point is to look at crazy and

1003
01:03:28,285 --> 01:03:31,805
Speaker 15:  wild concepts. But If you take a little bit more of an effort and you go

1004
01:03:31,805 --> 01:03:35,725
Speaker 15:  into the actual presentation documents that are attached to them,

1005
01:03:36,065 --> 01:03:39,605
Speaker 15:  that's where you really see the width of it. Ah, okay look,

1006
01:03:39,915 --> 01:03:43,405
Speaker 15:  they had this kind of background understanding and look, this is what they

1007
01:03:43,405 --> 01:03:47,005
Speaker 15:  thought about and, and oh they did five different ideas that were

1008
01:03:47,005 --> 01:03:50,405
Speaker 15:  completely different than what actually turned out in the end and so on.

1009
01:03:50,905 --> 01:03:54,805
Speaker 15:  So I'm wishing and hoping for that, that people would take the

1010
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:58,725
Speaker 15:  time and effort to go a little bit beyond only cool gadgets. But

1011
01:03:58,725 --> 01:03:59,165
Speaker 15:  let's see.

1012
01:03:59,855 --> 01:04:03,045
Speaker 2:  There are so many cool gadgets though. You could, I, there's just so many

1013
01:04:03,045 --> 01:04:03,805
Speaker 2:  cool gadgets.

1014
01:04:05,545 --> 01:04:08,285
Speaker 2:  Why do you think, this is the thing I've been thinking about and and you've

1015
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:11,005
Speaker 2:  spent more time in these documents than I have, so I'm curious If you have

1016
01:04:11,005 --> 01:04:14,605
Speaker 2:  any thoughts, why was Nokia so obsessed with these modular

1017
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:18,725
Speaker 2:  gadgets? I mean truly everything is like, it's a thing that goes into

1018
01:04:18,765 --> 01:04:21,965
Speaker 2:  a case and becomes something else or bends around. There's one that was like,

1019
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:25,565
Speaker 2:  you can put it on your ankle or around your wrist or hold it like a phone.

1020
01:04:25,585 --> 01:04:29,205
Speaker 2:  And there was this, this obsession with these sort of malleable

1021
01:04:29,235 --> 01:04:31,685
Speaker 2:  gadgets. Why do you think that was so pervasive?

1022
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:35,415
Speaker 15:  There's probably many answers and I'm, I'm not sure that was always the,

1023
01:04:35,555 --> 01:04:39,135
Speaker 15:  the obsession either, but I think it's, it's good to remember

1024
01:04:39,525 --> 01:04:43,495
Speaker 15:  what did the real products look like when these concepts were made. So

1025
01:04:43,495 --> 01:04:47,295
Speaker 15:  many of the early modular concepts, the real products were actually

1026
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:51,215
Speaker 15:  huge lumps that you were dragging along, right? You know, so

1027
01:04:51,215 --> 01:04:54,975
Speaker 15:  If you, If you did want to use it while using sports for

1028
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:58,495
Speaker 15:  example, maybe you didn't wanna go jogging with something that

1029
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:01,855
Speaker 15:  weighed a lot, maybe it would've been a lot easier If you could take just

1030
01:05:01,935 --> 01:05:05,415
Speaker 15:  a small part of something with you. So maybe people also

1031
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:06,015
Speaker 15:  imagined

1032
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:11,495
Speaker 15:  in relation to what they had at the time. Hmm. So so you take the

1033
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:15,375
Speaker 15:  challenge with what you have then, and then you try to imagine

1034
01:05:16,255 --> 01:05:19,925
Speaker 15:  a solution that would be better than that. But now we only see

1035
01:05:20,305 --> 01:05:24,085
Speaker 15:  the proposed solution and we forget why they thought that was better

1036
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:24,885
Speaker 15:  than what they had.

1037
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:29,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean it, it's interesting to think that there was that kind of

1038
01:05:29,685 --> 01:05:33,645
Speaker 2:  thinking going at the same time as Nokia

1039
01:05:33,645 --> 01:05:37,005
Speaker 2:  was kind of at the peak of its powers though. I mean the company was so big

1040
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:40,605
Speaker 2:  and so powerful and made the phones

1041
01:05:40,635 --> 01:05:44,245
Speaker 2:  everybody had, but still seemed to have this

1042
01:05:45,155 --> 01:05:49,085
Speaker 2:  sort of wildly experimental arm going on. And again,

1043
01:05:49,085 --> 01:05:51,325
Speaker 2:  maybe there's more of that going on in some of these companies than we think,

1044
01:05:51,345 --> 01:05:54,565
Speaker 2:  but my sense is now, especially

1045
01:05:55,415 --> 01:05:59,205
Speaker 2:  these gadgets are so big and so important and there's so much money in them

1046
01:05:59,795 --> 01:06:03,485
Speaker 2:  that I, I I just would bet there are not a lot of people

1047
01:06:03,985 --> 01:06:07,645
Speaker 2:  inside of Apple thinking about wholesale lifestyle changes to the iPhone,

1048
01:06:07,645 --> 01:06:10,445
Speaker 2:  right? Like the, these things maybe have just matured beyond that point,

1049
01:06:10,985 --> 01:06:14,445
Speaker 2:  but it's forever interesting to me that even at the moment Nokia is making

1050
01:06:14,785 --> 01:06:18,725
Speaker 2:  all of the bestselling phones on earth, all of them, it was

1051
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:22,565
Speaker 2:  still in this phase of like, how can we reimagine everything all

1052
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:22,845
Speaker 2:  the time?

1053
01:06:23,455 --> 01:06:27,405
Speaker 15:  Agree. But I can also contradict you a little bit. I think it's

1054
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:31,085
Speaker 15:  actually normal because we have other research that shows that

1055
01:06:31,305 --> 01:06:35,165
Speaker 15:  in a moment of big pivots when everything is changing in the world where,

1056
01:06:35,165 --> 01:06:39,005
Speaker 15:  where technology shifts are happening, big shifts like we have today, then

1057
01:06:39,185 --> 01:06:42,965
Speaker 15:  that's exactly the moment where you need to be more creative. So

1058
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,485
Speaker 15:  that's also the moment in time where you need to think

1059
01:06:46,785 --> 01:06:48,355
Speaker 15:  with a broader mindset. Hmm.

1060
01:06:48,815 --> 01:06:52,715
Speaker 2:  And and was there something about Nokia's sort of corporate culture that

1061
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,915
Speaker 2:  pushed towards that with just people given permission to do that kind of

1062
01:06:56,915 --> 01:06:57,795
Speaker 2:  thing More than most?

1063
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:00,995
Speaker 15:  I think there was, and I'm not sure they were given permission or if the

1064
01:07:00,995 --> 01:07:04,315
Speaker 15:  culture was just such that they dared to take the permission even

1065
01:07:04,665 --> 01:07:08,555
Speaker 15:  without getting so, so more of a culture

1066
01:07:08,655 --> 01:07:12,475
Speaker 15:  of of try it and, and see which

1067
01:07:12,735 --> 01:07:16,595
Speaker 15:  is great and which there's a lot of other scholars talking about today

1068
01:07:16,595 --> 01:07:19,515
Speaker 15:  that that's the kind of organizational culture that would be great to have

1069
01:07:19,805 --> 01:07:23,635
Speaker 15:  where people aren't afraid to try stuff or, or so, so,

1070
01:07:23,735 --> 01:07:27,275
Speaker 15:  so, but of course we don't know what other companies are doing at the moment.

1071
01:07:27,685 --> 01:07:28,755
Speaker 15:  Right. But

1072
01:07:29,015 --> 01:07:30,315
Speaker 2:  But hopefully they'll share now too.

1073
01:07:30,745 --> 01:07:34,715
Speaker 15:  Exactly. But there's something in, in the air today where

1074
01:07:34,735 --> 01:07:37,955
Speaker 15:  we are a little bit cautious, we're very afraid of doing wrong,

1075
01:07:38,745 --> 01:07:42,635
Speaker 15:  whereas I think it's wonderful when we can try things out that maybe

1076
01:07:42,635 --> 01:07:44,155
Speaker 15:  some of them can be right.

1077
01:07:44,905 --> 01:07:48,435
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. And is it, are there things to be

1078
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:52,475
Speaker 2:  learned for tech companies now, do you think on, on how all of this worked?

1079
01:07:52,555 --> 01:07:55,275
Speaker 2:  I mean, to some extent some of this stuff is so

1080
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:59,575
Speaker 2:  different in the world in which it was taking place than the one that we

1081
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,015
Speaker 2:  live in now that

1082
01:08:02,975 --> 01:08:06,815
Speaker 2:  I, I wonder how like some of the, some of the sort of specifics are

1083
01:08:07,055 --> 01:08:10,975
Speaker 2:  probably not applicable, like Nokia's wild ideas, some of them

1084
01:08:10,975 --> 01:08:14,895
Speaker 2:  are less wild now and some of them are even more wild now. But do you think

1085
01:08:15,185 --> 01:08:18,725
Speaker 2:  if I'm a, if I'm a tech company in 2025, trying to think through how to

1086
01:08:19,235 --> 01:08:22,925
Speaker 2:  replicate processes like these, like are there lessons from Nokia in that?

1087
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:27,195
Speaker 15:  Definitely and I think ways of working are still very valid. So say for

1088
01:08:27,195 --> 01:08:30,435
Speaker 15:  example that you are in a completely different company, a smaller one that's

1089
01:08:30,595 --> 01:08:34,395
Speaker 15:  starting with this kind of, of, you know, future technology thinking maybe

1090
01:08:34,395 --> 01:08:38,275
Speaker 15:  it's a good thing to be able to peak somewhere, but how did they do? Because

1091
01:08:38,425 --> 01:08:42,075
Speaker 15:  much of the ways of doing it are still very much the same. You try to

1092
01:08:42,075 --> 01:08:45,915
Speaker 15:  understand end users and you try to imagine what could be, and you develop

1093
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:49,595
Speaker 15:  products which will be the best possible for whomever you're trying to approach

1094
01:08:49,655 --> 01:08:53,595
Speaker 15:  and so on. So, so I think, or

1095
01:08:53,595 --> 01:08:57,515
Speaker 15:  I'm hoping at least maybe one day it could be useful also for someone

1096
01:08:57,695 --> 01:09:01,515
Speaker 15:  who, who should know how it works but isn't quite sure, you know,

1097
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:05,115
Speaker 15:  maybe it could be your backdrop so that you could, you could check how they

1098
01:09:05,115 --> 01:09:08,315
Speaker 15:  did before you go into a meeting of your own or, or something. I don't know.

1099
01:09:08,775 --> 01:09:12,755
Speaker 2:  Do you think we are back at a similar moment because of ai? I think

1100
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:16,595
Speaker 2:  we certainly have not had a moment as sort of

1101
01:09:16,995 --> 01:09:20,355
Speaker 2:  specifically culturally transformative since

1102
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:25,275
Speaker 2:  cell phones and, and you can kind of write that timeline however you want,

1103
01:09:25,275 --> 01:09:29,195
Speaker 2:  but it's probably been somewhere between 15

1104
01:09:29,295 --> 01:09:32,155
Speaker 2:  and 20 years since we had a moment like that. Do you think we're back in

1105
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:33,955
Speaker 2:  one of those moments because of ai?

1106
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:38,355
Speaker 15:  Very much so. And I don't think it's only the arrival of new technology.

1107
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,915
Speaker 15:  And that's what I'm hoping that this Archive will show too. It's society

1108
01:09:41,985 --> 01:09:45,835
Speaker 15:  only shifts when people shift how they, you know, interact

1109
01:09:45,835 --> 01:09:49,635
Speaker 15:  and are in the world too. And that's, that's where people come in and,

1110
01:09:49,655 --> 01:09:53,315
Speaker 15:  and that's I think what something that you can see from this material that,

1111
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:56,875
Speaker 15:  you know, it really tries to understand what do people do with it and how

1112
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:59,635
Speaker 15:  do they conduct their lives and what would make sense for them and so on.

1113
01:09:59,855 --> 01:10:03,595
Speaker 15:  And I think we are definitely in that societal pivotal moment

1114
01:10:03,815 --> 01:10:07,715
Speaker 15:  now where, where we, we know that new technology will be with us,

1115
01:10:07,775 --> 01:10:11,355
Speaker 15:  but we don't quite know how we will use it in our

1116
01:10:11,595 --> 01:10:15,435
Speaker 15:  everyday, it isn't very tangible yet. We don't know

1117
01:10:15,535 --> 01:10:19,475
Speaker 15:  how how we will conduct our lives differently through it. So, so

1118
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:23,355
Speaker 15:  I think it would be a wonderful moment in time too to use similar methodology

1119
01:10:23,495 --> 01:10:27,315
Speaker 15:  and to, to to learn from at least what has been and

1120
01:10:27,415 --> 01:10:31,095
Speaker 15:  and and to try and be creative. Maybe

1121
01:10:31,235 --> 01:10:34,775
Speaker 15:  be optimistic or, or, or imagine what could be

1122
01:10:35,255 --> 01:10:38,935
Speaker 2:  A, a question I find myself talking about with, with product makers a lot

1123
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:42,655
Speaker 2:  is just how far into the future is it even useful to think

1124
01:10:43,055 --> 01:10:46,895
Speaker 2:  about? And I increasingly, I talk to folks in tech

1125
01:10:46,915 --> 01:10:50,415
Speaker 2:  who are thinking about like 18 months from now and, and three years from

1126
01:10:50,435 --> 01:10:54,415
Speaker 2:  now because they're of the mind that it's just not useful to make

1127
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:57,855
Speaker 2:  bigger, longer prognostications because the world changes very fast and also

1128
01:10:57,915 --> 01:11:00,415
Speaker 2:  who cares, right? Like, we'll figure that out when we get there.

1129
01:11:01,835 --> 01:11:05,575
Speaker 2:  But even again, just to go back to the science fiction comparison, there

1130
01:11:05,575 --> 01:11:09,415
Speaker 2:  is so much in this Archive that is just

1131
01:11:09,605 --> 01:11:13,565
Speaker 2:  pure sort of futuristic science fiction and, and I wonder

1132
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:18,485
Speaker 2:  inside of a company what value that brings

1133
01:11:18,505 --> 01:11:21,165
Speaker 2:  for a company that is like shipping and making new products to also think

1134
01:11:21,165 --> 01:11:25,085
Speaker 2:  what is the world gonna look like in 10 or 20 or 50 years? And Nokia was

1135
01:11:25,085 --> 01:11:29,005
Speaker 2:  clearly doing a lot of that and, and I have forever kind of

1136
01:11:29,005 --> 01:11:32,685
Speaker 2:  wondered how valuable that kind of thinking is

1137
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:33,885
Speaker 2:  inside of a company like that.

1138
01:11:34,365 --> 01:11:37,565
Speaker 15:  I think the important point is that the world doesn't happen. Someone

1139
01:11:38,115 --> 01:11:41,805
Speaker 15:  does something that changes something and, and

1140
01:11:42,025 --> 01:11:45,845
Speaker 15:  you know, the, this shows some examples of how that was done, but, but that's

1141
01:11:45,845 --> 01:11:49,365
Speaker 15:  exactly how, so this 18 month thinking

1142
01:11:49,535 --> 01:11:53,045
Speaker 15:  cycle, it means that you think that someone else will create the world and

1143
01:11:53,045 --> 01:11:56,845
Speaker 15:  you'll just be reacting to it. Whereas you can also think of what would

1144
01:11:56,845 --> 01:12:00,685
Speaker 15:  you want it to be or, or what would you not want it to be? And, and start

1145
01:12:00,685 --> 01:12:04,645
Speaker 15:  having a discussion around that and then hopefully maybe, you know,

1146
01:12:04,645 --> 01:12:08,125
Speaker 15:  coming out with something that makes sense in whatever you've imagined.

1147
01:12:09,755 --> 01:12:13,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Do you think, do you think Nokia gets credit for moments like that

1148
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:17,605
Speaker 2:  in, in some of the history you've been looking at? Are there kind of before

1149
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,885
Speaker 2:  and after moments because of something that came out of this company?

1150
01:12:22,155 --> 01:12:25,955
Speaker 15:  I think Nokia got a lot of credit of all the great things it did when it

1151
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:26,115
Speaker 15:  was

1152
01:12:27,715 --> 01:12:31,095
Speaker 15:  as its biggest. Then it got a lot of negative

1153
01:12:32,185 --> 01:12:35,675
Speaker 15:  sort of insights from, from when it didn't do so well. And we've been living

1154
01:12:35,775 --> 01:12:39,675
Speaker 15:  in that wave now with a lot of people trying to

1155
01:12:39,675 --> 01:12:42,755
Speaker 15:  think what went wrong and so on. But I'm hoping that we're sort of getting

1156
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:46,875
Speaker 15:  beyond both of those now to a period where we can look at it with

1157
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:50,835
Speaker 15:  more, not neutral eyes, but different eyes, you know, to see different

1158
01:12:50,835 --> 01:12:53,875
Speaker 15:  perspectives out of the material and, and different angles that we hadn't

1159
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:57,595
Speaker 15:  thought of before and so on. So, so that's I think, quite typical

1160
01:12:57,705 --> 01:13:01,435
Speaker 15:  that near time we're always blind. So in the

1161
01:13:01,445 --> 01:13:04,635
Speaker 15:  Nokia case, I think we've been blind in both directions.

1162
01:13:05,065 --> 01:13:09,035
Speaker 2:  Looking through the Archive, I found myself torn between sort

1163
01:13:09,035 --> 01:13:12,875
Speaker 2:  of two overarching theories. One is

1164
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:16,835
Speaker 2:  that there was kind of a, a unified theory

1165
01:13:17,095 --> 01:13:20,995
Speaker 2:  of Nokia about phones in particular and the future and

1166
01:13:21,305 --> 01:13:24,475
Speaker 2:  kind of how technology and people were supposed to interact.

1167
01:13:25,455 --> 01:13:29,235
Speaker 2:  And I feel like it, I could, I could sort of twist into like a,

1168
01:13:29,355 --> 01:13:33,235
Speaker 2:  a unifying theory of everything. And on the other side, I, I

1169
01:13:33,235 --> 01:13:36,475
Speaker 2:  was struck by the fact that actually what's going on is just this unbelievably

1170
01:13:36,475 --> 01:13:39,875
Speaker 2:  chaotic design process where everybody is trying to think about everything

1171
01:13:40,135 --> 01:13:43,795
Speaker 2:  and then you just throw it all in a pot and hope something cool comes out.

1172
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:47,395
Speaker 2:  And that maybe that's actually the magic of design is that there is

1173
01:13:47,395 --> 01:13:50,115
Speaker 2:  something unknowably weird going on here.

1174
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:54,835
Speaker 2:  Is it, is it either one of those two things? Is it something in between?

1175
01:13:55,275 --> 01:13:58,835
Speaker 15:  I think it's probably both. Okay. So it's of course it's messy and and creative

1176
01:13:58,885 --> 01:14:02,275
Speaker 15:  while you're at it. And of course there's always some structure into it,

1177
01:14:02,935 --> 01:14:06,835
Speaker 15:  but it can also depend on on who's who you will be asking or

1178
01:14:07,225 --> 01:14:10,875
Speaker 15:  when you will be asking and, and what the, the opportunities

1179
01:14:11,065 --> 01:14:14,725
Speaker 15:  to do something around you are. But, but it's definitely both of those,

1180
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:18,685
Speaker 15:  it's, it's very rarely completely clear from the very beginning. It's, it's

1181
01:14:18,685 --> 01:14:22,405
Speaker 15:  very, you know, complex and messy and you try stuff

1182
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:25,605
Speaker 15:  out and then at some point it has to get slightly clearer 'cause otherwise

1183
01:14:25,605 --> 01:14:29,005
Speaker 15:  you won't be an organization that actually produces anything.

1184
01:14:29,905 --> 01:14:33,365
Speaker 15:  So, so, so there's a, there's both.

1185
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:37,445
Speaker 2:  Okay. I just think I, the, the unifying theory I keep coming back to and

1186
01:14:37,445 --> 01:14:39,885
Speaker 2:  I'm just gonna, I'm gonna pause at this and then I'm curious how, what you

1187
01:14:39,885 --> 01:14:43,485
Speaker 2:  think about it. I think we live in a moment now where

1188
01:14:43,695 --> 01:14:47,645
Speaker 2:  technology is such a destination, right? Where everybody is

1189
01:14:47,845 --> 01:14:51,765
Speaker 2:  building metaverse worlds for you to go to and games you're supposed to

1190
01:14:51,765 --> 01:14:55,285
Speaker 2:  spend time in and screens you're supposed to stare at for hours at a time

1191
01:14:55,545 --> 01:14:59,045
Speaker 2:  and everything is supposed to sort of draw you in and engage you more and

1192
01:14:59,045 --> 01:15:02,685
Speaker 2:  more. And I feel like Nokia at, at that moment, and I'm thinking

1193
01:15:02,685 --> 01:15:05,005
Speaker 2:  particularly kind of right after

1194
01:15:06,595 --> 01:15:10,375
Speaker 2:  to the year 2000, kind of in that phase between cell phones were everywhere,

1195
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:13,895
Speaker 2:  but smart phones were nowhere yet, right? In that moment, Nokia had this

1196
01:15:13,925 --> 01:15:17,855
Speaker 2:  very human centric idea of technology that it was a

1197
01:15:17,855 --> 01:15:21,655
Speaker 2:  thing that should fit onto you and be an accessory and be

1198
01:15:21,655 --> 01:15:25,055
Speaker 2:  around you, but was not meant to be this sort of all

1199
01:15:25,205 --> 01:15:29,175
Speaker 2:  consuming, engaging thing. It they were, it,

1200
01:15:29,175 --> 01:15:33,055
Speaker 2:  it, it all feels more like fashion than electronics in a way that I find

1201
01:15:33,055 --> 01:15:37,015
Speaker 2:  really interesting. And I, that's probably not everything, but I think that

1202
01:15:37,015 --> 01:15:40,055
Speaker 2:  to me just felt so different than what I'm used to in technology that I was

1203
01:15:40,055 --> 01:15:43,935
Speaker 2:  like, maybe this is just, maybe Nokia had a different idea about how we're

1204
01:15:44,015 --> 01:15:46,535
Speaker 2:  supposed to use technology than a lot of companies

1205
01:15:47,145 --> 01:15:51,015
Speaker 15:  Could be. And doesn't it always, every trend is always followed by

1206
01:15:51,055 --> 01:15:54,815
Speaker 15:  a counter trend and then back again. So If you have something that is,

1207
01:15:56,425 --> 01:16:00,405
Speaker 15:  you know, very focused on doing something well then you come

1208
01:16:00,405 --> 01:16:04,205
Speaker 15:  to a period when, where something should do everything for everyone. Hmm.

1209
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:07,245
Speaker 15:  And then you might be coming back to a period where something should do

1210
01:16:07,245 --> 01:16:11,205
Speaker 15:  something well for someone. I can see the same, we have a lot

1211
01:16:11,205 --> 01:16:14,805
Speaker 15:  of people talking about how the digital era

1212
01:16:14,915 --> 01:16:18,725
Speaker 15:  made everything untangible and, and you know, just

1213
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:22,565
Speaker 15:  pixels. And now I can also, in our students, I can see a trend back that

1214
01:16:22,565 --> 01:16:26,085
Speaker 15:  the haptic and the feeling of things and, and, and materiality

1215
01:16:26,145 --> 01:16:30,125
Speaker 15:  gained in importance again. So, so somehow these things also,

1216
01:16:30,885 --> 01:16:33,725
Speaker 15:  I don't know, but it seems like they're almost going in waves a little bit.

1217
01:16:34,235 --> 01:16:37,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I hope so. I mean, I, I look at so many of those concepts and presentations

1218
01:16:37,685 --> 01:16:41,125
Speaker 2:  and, and they're so obsessed with materials and, and

1219
01:16:41,355 --> 01:16:45,165
Speaker 2:  plushness and like they made electronics that were squishy. Nothing

1220
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:47,845
Speaker 2:  is squishy anymore. I love that they were squishy. How does

1221
01:16:47,845 --> 01:16:51,725
Speaker 15:  It feel to your skin and how do you interact with it in

1222
01:16:51,805 --> 01:16:52,165
Speaker 15:  a Yeah,

1223
01:16:52,435 --> 01:16:53,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah, maybe. I hope we get

1224
01:18:14,925 --> 01:18:18,225
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So last week on the work cast hotline, we answered

1225
01:18:18,265 --> 01:18:22,145
Speaker 2:  a question about audio on your iPhone and basically why can't you listen

1226
01:18:22,205 --> 01:18:26,145
Speaker 2:  to two things at the same time on your phone? I got a lot of feedback

1227
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:30,105
Speaker 2:  from that hotline question, which was really fascinating. And the biggest

1228
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:33,905
Speaker 2:  thing I heard from a couple of folks from developers in particular is

1229
01:18:33,905 --> 01:18:37,705
Speaker 2:  that when you have the thing that you're listening to music or

1230
01:18:37,865 --> 01:18:41,465
Speaker 2:  a podcast or whatever and you open an app that isn't immediately playing

1231
01:18:41,475 --> 01:18:45,225
Speaker 2:  audio but turns off the audio, you were already listening to like a lot of

1232
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:48,625
Speaker 2:  games do this, like, like I said on last week's show, the ESPN app does this.

1233
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:53,185
Speaker 2:  That's bad development and I, I, I know that, but I don't think I hit that

1234
01:18:53,185 --> 01:18:56,465
Speaker 2:  hard enough that that is not how that's supposed to work. That the way that

1235
01:18:56,465 --> 01:19:00,265
Speaker 2:  these apps manage outside background, audio

1236
01:19:00,515 --> 01:19:03,985
Speaker 2:  input is up to them and they could all stand to do a much better job.

1237
01:19:04,885 --> 01:19:07,625
Speaker 2:  One thing I like is I think a bunch of games actually do this really well

1238
01:19:07,635 --> 01:19:11,465
Speaker 2:  where you can be listening to a podcast but

1239
01:19:11,465 --> 01:19:15,185
Speaker 2:  playing the game and it'll, it'll play the game over top of

1240
01:19:15,285 --> 01:19:18,465
Speaker 2:  the audio sometimes. But If you also just, you know, turn off all the audio

1241
01:19:18,845 --> 01:19:22,785
Speaker 2:  in the game, you can just play your podcast. So like this thing can work

1242
01:19:23,205 --> 01:19:25,945
Speaker 2:  and the fact that it doesn't is a little bit Apple's fault because I think

1243
01:19:25,945 --> 01:19:29,465
Speaker 2:  Apple tries to hold people's hand too much, but it's also

1244
01:19:29,615 --> 01:19:33,145
Speaker 2:  developer's fault for not caring about getting that right. So If you run

1245
01:19:33,145 --> 01:19:36,025
Speaker 2:  into an app that's not getting that right complain because they can do better.

1246
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:40,065
Speaker 2:  All that said, we got a question from Gus along the same lines

1247
01:19:40,495 --> 01:19:44,345
Speaker 2:  that has had me thinking all week. Gus says, sitting

1248
01:19:44,345 --> 01:19:47,225
Speaker 2:  in the drain listening to last week's show, I had a question, you explain

1249
01:19:47,225 --> 01:19:50,185
Speaker 2:  the difficulties of combining audio sources to a single output. I wonder

1250
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:53,465
Speaker 2:  why it's also complicated the other way around when I wanna share the audio

1251
01:19:53,465 --> 01:19:57,225
Speaker 2:  from my phone to two sets of Bluetooth headphones, this appears impossible.

1252
01:19:57,925 --> 01:20:01,905
Speaker 2:  Yes, you can share earbuds, but not headphones, ox, audio splitters

1253
01:20:01,905 --> 01:20:05,785
Speaker 2:  were a thing. Why is this not a thing with wireless? This is the most

1254
01:20:06,065 --> 01:20:09,405
Speaker 2:  fascinating question. So I looked into this a bunch and

1255
01:20:10,365 --> 01:20:14,085
Speaker 2:  I have a couple of theories, but my theories are actually not the most

1256
01:20:14,245 --> 01:20:16,885
Speaker 2:  interesting part. So lemme just get through that really fast. I think one

1257
01:20:16,885 --> 01:20:20,805
Speaker 2:  of the reasons this is hard to do on an iPhone in particular is again,

1258
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:24,925
Speaker 2:  it's not a particularly popular thing and I think if

1259
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:28,845
Speaker 2:  you're a company like Apple, having it set so that

1260
01:20:28,905 --> 01:20:32,805
Speaker 2:  you can send all your audio to all your headphones all at the same time

1261
01:20:33,675 --> 01:20:37,325
Speaker 2:  just feels messy. And so for Apple to be able to say it's essentially

1262
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:40,445
Speaker 2:  one audio device at a time, you don't have to manage it. You don't have to

1263
01:20:40,445 --> 01:20:43,245
Speaker 2:  go in and turn them off, you don't have to mess with it. You just tap the

1264
01:20:43,245 --> 01:20:46,965
Speaker 2:  one that you want and you start listening. Like I think about the Sonos thing

1265
01:20:46,965 --> 01:20:50,845
Speaker 2:  where If you have a bunch of Sonos speakers, you can set up kind of

1266
01:20:51,205 --> 01:20:55,165
Speaker 2:  infinite overlapping sets of those speakers. You're like, okay, I want this

1267
01:20:55,505 --> 01:20:59,165
Speaker 2:  to just play in my bedroom and in the bathroom, but I want this to play in

1268
01:20:59,165 --> 01:21:01,405
Speaker 2:  the living room, the bedroom in the bathroom, and I want this one to be on

1269
01:21:01,405 --> 01:21:05,285
Speaker 2:  all of them. That's really handy. But it's a lot of work and

1270
01:21:05,325 --> 01:21:09,125
Speaker 2:  I think for Apple particularly because Bluetooth frankly does

1271
01:21:09,185 --> 01:21:12,885
Speaker 2:  get messy, it is not a particularly great protocol. So if you're trying to

1272
01:21:12,885 --> 01:21:16,565
Speaker 2:  send synced audio to a bunch of places at once, it can get really complicated.

1273
01:21:16,795 --> 01:21:19,925
Speaker 2:  There's actually a way to do this on Android. I'll put a link in the show

1274
01:21:19,925 --> 01:21:22,925
Speaker 2:  notes, but especially If you have a Samsung phone, this is a pretty easy

1275
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:25,965
Speaker 2:  thing to do. One thing I've learned by the way through this process is that

1276
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:29,325
Speaker 2:  Samsung phones are very good at just letting you do things. And I've come

1277
01:21:29,325 --> 01:21:33,165
Speaker 2:  to really appreciate that about Samsung phones. They're like overly

1278
01:21:33,165 --> 01:21:36,445
Speaker 2:  complicated in a lot of ways. They have too many settings, menus. But when

1279
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:40,405
Speaker 2:  I look up like how do you do this hard thing on a phone? The

1280
01:21:40,405 --> 01:21:43,045
Speaker 2:  answer most of the time is like, you can't do it on iOS, you can kind of

1281
01:21:43,045 --> 01:21:46,565
Speaker 2:  do it on Android and Samsung just has a setting for it and I love Samsung

1282
01:21:46,705 --> 01:21:50,205
Speaker 2:  for that. But I wanna share with you the thing that I discovered, and it's

1283
01:21:50,365 --> 01:21:54,045
Speaker 2:  possible that I am the last person on earth to have learned this, but I learned

1284
01:21:54,045 --> 01:21:57,725
Speaker 2:  this and so I'm gonna share it. There's this thing on

1285
01:21:58,265 --> 01:22:01,925
Speaker 2:  iOS that lets you share audio from your device

1286
01:22:02,345 --> 01:22:06,205
Speaker 2:  to multiple sets of headphones at the same time. I had no idea this existed.

1287
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:10,485
Speaker 2:  I have done the thing where my wife and I sit on the

1288
01:22:10,485 --> 01:22:14,045
Speaker 2:  bed and she has one AirPod and I have the other

1289
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:17,605
Speaker 2:  AirPod and we just like share a pair of headphones that way we have to keep

1290
01:22:17,605 --> 01:22:21,045
Speaker 2:  our heads really close to each other, like that's bad. And I just had no

1291
01:22:21,045 --> 01:22:25,005
Speaker 2:  idea there was a better way. But it turns out that If you have a supported

1292
01:22:25,105 --> 01:22:28,125
Speaker 2:  device, which is basically any newish

1293
01:22:28,825 --> 01:22:32,045
Speaker 2:  iPhone or iPad, it doesn't seem to work on other devices.

1294
01:22:32,665 --> 01:22:36,205
Speaker 2:  You can actually do it on a Mac by using the, the

1295
01:22:36,435 --> 01:22:39,965
Speaker 2:  MIDI settings thing on the Mac that's a little more complicated. But

1296
01:22:40,225 --> 01:22:43,045
Speaker 2:  on an iPhone in particular and on on an iPad, which I think is where most

1297
01:22:43,045 --> 01:22:46,725
Speaker 2:  people would wanna do this kind of thing, basically you put on your

1298
01:22:46,915 --> 01:22:50,805
Speaker 2:  AirPods, this only works If you have AirPods or Beats headphones, but

1299
01:22:50,805 --> 01:22:54,725
Speaker 2:  If you put on your AirPods and then when something is playing, you

1300
01:22:54,745 --> 01:22:58,365
Speaker 2:  tap the, the like, I guess it's this sort of airplay

1301
01:22:58,535 --> 01:23:02,445
Speaker 2:  thing, it's the little triangle with the, the radial circles around it.

1302
01:23:02,955 --> 01:23:05,925
Speaker 2:  It's a, it's sort of a sharing menu sort of an of an airplane menu. I don't

1303
01:23:05,925 --> 01:23:09,845
Speaker 2:  really know what to call it, but it's an icon and you tap it and if someone

1304
01:23:10,435 --> 01:23:14,285
Speaker 2:  near you has headphones that you can bring close to your own

1305
01:23:14,285 --> 01:23:18,245
Speaker 2:  device, you get a thing that says share audio and you, you

1306
01:23:18,245 --> 01:23:22,165
Speaker 2:  tap share audio and it'll pop up a new set

1307
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:25,205
Speaker 2:  of headphones as if you're pairing a new set of headphones to your device.

1308
01:23:26,025 --> 01:23:29,845
Speaker 2:  You then, at least what I've had to do in the past is press and hold the

1309
01:23:29,845 --> 01:23:33,405
Speaker 2:  button on the back of those AirPods like the, the pairing button on the case,

1310
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:38,365
Speaker 2:  but then it, it actually syncs it up to your phone and you

1311
01:23:38,365 --> 01:23:41,765
Speaker 2:  can play through two sets of AirPods at the same time.

1312
01:23:42,725 --> 01:23:46,455
Speaker 2:  This blew my mind, like how is this not a more known feature? Maybe

1313
01:23:46,515 --> 01:23:50,135
Speaker 2:  I'm the last person on earth again to have discovered that this exists. But

1314
01:23:50,135 --> 01:23:53,815
Speaker 2:  this is just a thing you can do. You can do it in control center. It's

1315
01:23:54,165 --> 01:23:57,735
Speaker 2:  most accessible I've found by the the little live activity

1316
01:23:57,735 --> 01:24:01,295
Speaker 2:  notification on the lock screen where you can hit the share button that way.

1317
01:24:02,195 --> 01:24:05,975
Speaker 2:  But the idea that you can actually have your phone connected and

1318
01:24:06,135 --> 01:24:10,015
Speaker 2:  synced simultaneously to two sets of AirPods is very cool.

1319
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:14,135
Speaker 2:  Again, it's only AirPods and beads headphones and it's only iPhones and

1320
01:24:14,345 --> 01:24:18,295
Speaker 2:  iPads of a certain recency, but odds are, I think they're, most

1321
01:24:18,295 --> 01:24:21,295
Speaker 2:  of them seem to be if your device still works,

1322
01:24:22,045 --> 01:24:25,885
Speaker 2:  it's new enough that it'll work. But this is nuts and this I think

1323
01:24:25,885 --> 01:24:29,245
Speaker 2:  will solve a lot of problems for a lot of people because the like iPhone

1324
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:33,285
Speaker 2:  AirPods connection is pretty real. So if I have AirPods and an iPhone

1325
01:24:33,285 --> 01:24:37,245
Speaker 2:  and you have AirPods, we can both listen through our AirPods to the same

1326
01:24:37,245 --> 01:24:41,205
Speaker 2:  thing at the same time. It's kind of hacky and it took me like three tries

1327
01:24:41,205 --> 01:24:44,965
Speaker 2:  to get it to work the first time with my wife's AirPods. And then you have

1328
01:24:44,965 --> 01:24:48,845
Speaker 2:  to make sure that they're both checked when they're connected and they'll

1329
01:24:48,845 --> 01:24:52,485
Speaker 2:  kind of disconnect If you take one of your headphones off then 'cause then

1330
01:24:52,485 --> 01:24:55,325
Speaker 2:  the pause gets sort of wacky. And this is the kind of thing where I'm like,

1331
01:24:55,325 --> 01:24:59,045
Speaker 2:  okay, I get why Apple is not super excited about this. Like if I'm wearing

1332
01:24:59,155 --> 01:25:02,245
Speaker 2:  AirPods and I have it set so that when I take my headphones out,

1333
01:25:02,945 --> 01:25:06,925
Speaker 2:  my music will pause. Should it also pause for you if you're wearing AirPods

1334
01:25:06,925 --> 01:25:10,885
Speaker 2:  and we have our audio sync, this stuff is complicated and I don't think

1335
01:25:10,885 --> 01:25:13,645
Speaker 2:  it works super well. I've been testing this a little bit and it's not perfect,

1336
01:25:14,465 --> 01:25:18,325
Speaker 2:  but like the, the use case that I have is

1337
01:25:18,605 --> 01:25:21,885
Speaker 2:  I have a sleeping child in my room and we wanna watch something that we can

1338
01:25:21,885 --> 01:25:25,685
Speaker 2:  both listen to. This legitimately solves that

1339
01:25:25,685 --> 01:25:28,605
Speaker 2:  problem and I think that's very exciting. So I'm gonna share a link in the

1340
01:25:28,605 --> 01:25:31,605
Speaker 2:  show notes to Apple's support page for how this works. It's pretty helpful

1341
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:35,605
Speaker 2:  and and does a good job of explaining how it works. But sharing

1342
01:25:35,605 --> 01:25:39,445
Speaker 2:  audio really works and you can do it on lots of different

1343
01:25:39,445 --> 01:25:43,365
Speaker 2:  devices and I highly recommend it If you wanna solve this

1344
01:25:43,365 --> 01:25:46,605
Speaker 2:  problem in a less hacky way. If you wanna solve this problem in a more hacky

1345
01:25:46,605 --> 01:25:50,365
Speaker 2:  way, you can do what I've been doing for years and just buy a headphone splitter.

1346
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,805
Speaker 2:  I have been traveling with a headphones splitter for a very long time and

1347
01:25:53,805 --> 01:25:57,245
Speaker 2:  I just plug it into the iPhone. Plug two sets of headphones in.

1348
01:25:57,935 --> 01:26:01,765
Speaker 2:  Bob's your uncle, as they say, it's a useful hack, but this one's a little

1349
01:26:01,765 --> 01:26:05,525
Speaker 2:  more elegant, let's say. Anyway, I'm still fascinated by how audio works

1350
01:26:05,525 --> 01:26:09,325
Speaker 2:  on these devices. So If you have more funky edge cases or ideas

1351
01:26:09,535 --> 01:26:13,445
Speaker 2:  about how all of this should work, I got a lot of people who agree with

1352
01:26:13,445 --> 01:26:17,365
Speaker 2:  my theory that what Apple needs here is a really good now playing

1353
01:26:17,425 --> 01:26:20,405
Speaker 2:  app that lets you control this stuff more manually. I don't think we're ever

1354
01:26:20,405 --> 01:26:23,405
Speaker 2:  getting that, but If you solved this, I wanna hear all about it.

1355
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:26,565
Speaker 2:  Anyway, for now, that is it for the first cast.

1356
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:30,885
Speaker 2:  Thank you to everybody who came on the show and thank you as always for listening.

1357
01:26:30,955 --> 01:26:34,125
Speaker 2:  There's lots more on everything we talked about@thefirst.com. I'll put a

1358
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:36,965
Speaker 2:  bunch of stuff in the show notes. I'm gonna link to as many of the apps and

1359
01:26:36,965 --> 01:26:40,565
Speaker 2:  things that V mentioned that I can find. I'll put some stuff for The Nokia

1360
01:26:40,565 --> 01:26:44,325
Speaker 2:  Design Archive in there. And as always read the verse.com. The news

1361
01:26:44,805 --> 01:26:48,005
Speaker 2:  continues unabated my friends. It's crazy out there. By the way, thank you

1362
01:26:48,005 --> 01:26:50,885
Speaker 2:  to everybody who's reached out with ideas about how we should cover politics

1363
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:54,325
Speaker 2:  and how you use chat GPT. We're gonna talk about a bunch of that stuff with

1364
01:26:54,395 --> 01:26:57,285
Speaker 2:  Neli on Friday. So If you have more ideas and more thoughts, get 'em in.

1365
01:26:57,735 --> 01:27:00,845
Speaker 2:  We're gonna have a pretty hotline episode on Friday. I'm very excited about

1366
01:27:00,845 --> 01:27:03,805
Speaker 2:  it. And as always, If you have thoughts, feelings, questions about anything

1372
01:27:22,245 --> 01:27:26,085
Speaker 2:  raising tons of money. How big is Mark Zuckerberg's data center and a whole

1373
01:27:26,085 --> 01:27:28,365
Speaker 2:  bunch of other stuff? We'll see you then. Rock and roll.
