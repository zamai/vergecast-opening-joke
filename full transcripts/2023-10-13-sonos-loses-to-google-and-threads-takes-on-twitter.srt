2
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,610
Speaker 4:  I welcome the Rich Cast, the flagship podcast of c s

3
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,410
Speaker 4:  s Elements. Top, bottom, left right. We've got 'em all here on

4
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,770
Speaker 4:  Vergecast. That's good. This is, I I promise you that will be relevant. I'm

5
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,050
Speaker 4:  your friend Neela. David. Pierce is here.

6
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,130
Speaker 5:  Hi. I should confess that I don't know the difference between margin and

7
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,290
Speaker 5:  padding and C ssss. And if someone would please email and explain that to

8
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,330
Speaker 5:  me, that would really help a

9
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,050
Speaker 4:  Lot. If you just opened a door, my friend. They

10
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,330
Speaker 5:  Create more space. That's, they both do that

11
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,290
Speaker 6:  Very differently.

12
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,170
Speaker 5:  I I'm confident it is different.

13
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,810
Speaker 4:  You have to. Okay. Here are the two rules. You have to limit yourself to

14
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,170
Speaker 4:  500 words and you can't use chat G B T, but then you can email David the

15
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,970
Speaker 4:  difference between margin and padding and C s s and I

16
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,730
Speaker 5:  Will recite several of those emails on this podcast. Sounds

17
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,930
Speaker 4:  Good. Alex Tran is here.

18
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,050
Speaker 6:  I have a confession to make in that. I thought the phrase Big Naturals

19
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,090
Speaker 6:  came from a Oh no

20
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,050
Speaker 4:  GF already. Oh wait. Meme, did you just say Gandalf?

21
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,010
Speaker 6:  I thought it was a Gandalf meme. That's all I'm gonna say about it. I just

22
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,770
Speaker 6:  wanna get that out there. I thought it was a Gandalf meme.

23
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,410
Speaker 4:  I realized now that you've opened this horrible door, it this

24
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,010
Speaker 4:  is the most vir that's ever happened. We've gone from c s s, but

25
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,290
Speaker 4:  I realized now last week I said I had this bad idea of an example because

26
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,610
Speaker 4:  of a meme and I didn't say what the meme was. Was it

27
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,250
Speaker 6:  Also the Gandalf

28
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,210
Speaker 4:  Heme? It was Kevin James.

29
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,170
Speaker 6:  Similar. Very similar.

30
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,250
Speaker 4:  And you can just go back and listen to what I was talking about contextually

31
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,090
Speaker 4:  to understand why that is a horrifying idea. You can find it.

32
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,650
Speaker 4:  Casey posted it in platformer. I'm just saying it's out there.

33
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,970
Speaker 6:  Just dmm me. I'll send it to you.

34
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,130
Speaker 4:  Don't do that. All. right. Here's why I was talking about C ss ss. This is

35
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,690
Speaker 4:  a thing that just got fixed on our website. Yeah. I think is one of the funniest

36
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,730
Speaker 4:  things that has ever been fixed on our website. We have a lot to talk about.

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,370
Speaker 4:  There's some Threads news. David reviewed the Meta Quest three

38
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,410
Speaker 4:  we've Sonos got just blasted by a federal judge

39
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,890
Speaker 4:  for patent abuse. Chris Welch is gonna join us. Talk about that. Have a lightning

40
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,720
Speaker 4:  round. But there's a thing that happened on our website that

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,400
Speaker 4:  is so silly. It is my favorite bug that we have ever fixed.

42
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,680
Speaker 4:  So we had published articles in like one of our fancy layouts and

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
Speaker 4:  we'd get all these comments that we're like, how dare you have black text

44
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,200
Speaker 4:  on an orange background? And we'd be like, what are you talking about? Like,

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,280
Speaker 4:  that's just the headline. That's fine. And after

46
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,120
Speaker 4:  a while I was like, there's no way this many people are this mad

47
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,280
Speaker 4:  about the headlines being on an orange bat. Like yeah,

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,960
Speaker 5:  We should say the way it's supposed to look is there's like a, A colored

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,600
Speaker 5:  banner at the top. Yeah, a right behind like the image and the

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,040
Speaker 5:  headline and the subhead and the author's name. And it's like a, it's a banner

51
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,880
Speaker 5:  that says like big important story and then it ends. And then you

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,720
Speaker 5:  read the story, which is black text on a white background.

53
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,880
Speaker 4:  And we were getting all these comments that were like, how dare you? And

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,880
Speaker 4:  I was like, that's weird. But You know it's a redesign. Everyone's mad about

55
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,720
Speaker 4:  everything in the redesign. So for a while we were just like, people are

56
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,000
Speaker 4:  just mad that we picked this color or any color at all. Which is a real thing

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,800
Speaker 4:  that happens when you make a website. How dare you use a color? Fine. We

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,480
Speaker 4:  use some color, I promise. We ran the accessibility checkers. But after a

59
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,200
Speaker 4:  while the sustained anger that there was black text on an orange

60
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,760
Speaker 4:  background, we were just like, there has to be something going on here. And

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,640
Speaker 4:  we finally figured it out. It is the silliest bug in the entire

62
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,000
Speaker 4:  world. All of those people, as best as we can tell, were using the Brave

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,880
Speaker 4:  Browser, which has a number of tracking

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,680
Speaker 4:  blockers and it is implemented in the most

65
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,720
Speaker 4:  shotgun way you can imagine. They just block all

66
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,680
Speaker 4:  instances of the word bot, which in their

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,120
Speaker 4:  implementation just means the string. B o t

68
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,480
Speaker 4:  gets blocked. Oh no. Which means CSS bottom got

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,840
Speaker 4:  blocked

70
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,920
Speaker 5:  On our page. Which by the way, the fact that that works for brave

71
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,120
Speaker 5:  is deeply hysterical.

72
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,280
Speaker 4:  So all these users, like we just like imagine trying to debug

73
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,120
Speaker 4:  this so that all these users were in fact a

74
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Speaker 4:  full page of an orange blackground with black text. We had, we couldn't tell.

75
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,840
Speaker 4:  But it was because of this approach to tracking prevention,

76
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,160
Speaker 4:  which is just brute force enforcement.

77
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,880
Speaker 5:  Wait, lemme just make sure I'm understanding this correctly. 'cause this

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,760
Speaker 5:  is amazing. So brave is just going in and anything that it's, it, anytime

79
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,840
Speaker 5:  it sees the letters b o t, it's just like, nah,

80
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,360
Speaker 4:  Kill it. That's the bot. Get rid of it.

81
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,960
Speaker 5:  And and we had, we had a thing meant to define the bottom

82
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,440
Speaker 5:  of Yep. The red. It was

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,120
Speaker 4:  Breaking our C ss s because it was blocking the word bottom somewhere in

84
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,960
Speaker 4:  there. Yeah. Both our product manager and our senior engineer are both named

85
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,880
Speaker 4:  Tara and I demanded just now in a meeting that they write about this 'cause

86
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,760
Speaker 4:  it's so silly 'cause they had to fix it. So good. So we fixed it. This

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,680
Speaker 4:  is what running a website in 2023 is like, it's great. Please

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,800
Speaker 4:  keep visiting our website no matter what browser you're on. But if you are

89
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,240
Speaker 4:  seeing something completely bananas, it might be

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,160
Speaker 4:  that your browser is doing something just maybe is what I've learned. Check,

91
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,800
Speaker 4:  check another browser. Always. Yeah, that's a goods, that's a web design

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,040
Speaker 4:  thing. That's why safari's there on your Yeah. On your computer.

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,800
Speaker 5:  I never use

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,000
Speaker 4:  It just but everyone's far to see if it's broken. Yeah. There's nothing more

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,880
Speaker 4:  powerful you can say in a product meeting than it's broken in Safari too.

96
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,640
Speaker 4:  Just that's

97
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,440
Speaker 5:  Real. Yeah. Done.

98
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,000
Speaker 4:  Alright, let's talk about some things. David, you just did a bunch of reviews

99
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,600
Speaker 4:  on the Wednesday show and then you just reviewed the Meta Quest quester.

100
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,640
Speaker 4:  You wanna talk about those quickly?

101
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well I'm, I'm mostly curious from the Pixel perspective, kind of what

102
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,720
Speaker 5:  you guys think of all this. We've been tracking this a lot. Neil, I you've,

103
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,280
Speaker 5:  you now had a week to sit with your, what is a photo feelings. I talked to

104
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,440
Speaker 5:  Allison a bunch about how she feels about this. She's a lot more, I would

105
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,160
Speaker 5:  say, normal human than you are about this. She's just like,

106
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,720
Speaker 5:  yeah, it's, it's, this stuff is complicated and weird and it doesn't always

107
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,760
Speaker 5:  work all that well. And I'm very aware every time I've edited these images,

108
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,520
Speaker 5:  that was one of the questions I asked her that I've actually gotten a surprising

109
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,320
Speaker 5:  amount of people responding to is this. Like, she was like, yeah, I,

110
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,680
Speaker 5:  my images look like normal images, but I know that I did something to them

111
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,320
Speaker 5:  and it sort of changes my relationship with it. Yeah. And I thought that

112
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,800
Speaker 5:  was really interesting. And a bunch of people have reached out and said,

113
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,160
Speaker 5:  not only do I feel that way with this stuff, but like it has changed the

114
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,920
Speaker 5:  way that I've edited all of my family photos forever. Because even when I

115
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,480
Speaker 5:  put the better face on, I remember and it changes

116
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,760
Speaker 5:  my relationship to that image when I change it. So, I've just been thinking

117
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,640
Speaker 5:  about that for like yeah. Days now. But I said on this show last

118
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,160
Speaker 5:  week that I was sort of disappointed in what the Pixel eight seemed to be.

119
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,000
Speaker 5:  And I feel like I have changed my tune now seeing Allison's review and other

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,160
Speaker 5:  people's reaction to it. People seem to be into this phone, like it seems

121
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,920
Speaker 5:  like they Google like did a good thing. I

122
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,200
Speaker 4:  Thought her framing of the review was really interesting and I encourage

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,520
Speaker 4:  people to read it. It's about whether or not you can trust Google, which

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,280
Speaker 4:  is where Google is. Like I, yeah. And I, I think the seven

125
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,680
Speaker 4:  years of updates that they promised, we got a bunch of notes. Why don't you

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,800
Speaker 4:  talk about the seven years of updates. I think people are excited about it.

127
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,400
Speaker 4:  It's, you can be of two minds about that One. You can be excited about it.

128
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,160
Speaker 4:  Google's finally gonna commit to a supporting a thing for seven years. Or

129
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,600
Speaker 4:  you can say, when will they break my heart? And I think we got a bunch of

130
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,520
Speaker 4:  notes on either side of that debate. I think that's a, a strange place

131
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,080
Speaker 4:  for Google to be in. Like people don't trust them to support their products

132
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,640
Speaker 4:  over the long term.

133
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,240
Speaker 5:  I mean, and with good reason. Why would they? I

134
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,040
Speaker 4:  They provided abundant evidence. So you, you make a promise, like we'll support

135
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,960
Speaker 4:  it for seven years and then you get a 50 50 reaction

136
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,760
Speaker 4:  to it, which is I think fascinating. And that's You know the

137
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,400
Speaker 4:  Pixel eight I think is just in that lineage of things. Like

138
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,080
Speaker 4:  are they gonna stay committed to all of these ideas or are they gonna walk

139
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,240
Speaker 4:  away from some of them? The assistant seems better and faster on this phone.

140
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,200
Speaker 4:  Will it work like that next year? We'll Google Flip the table and, and Android

141
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,520
Speaker 4:  15. Like there's just a lot of that embedded in this phone alongside,

142
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,040
Speaker 4:  oh, some ideas did iterate themselves to completion and it's

143
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,920
Speaker 4:  pretty good. Yeah,

144
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,400
Speaker 5:  I think that's right. And I think the AI stuff is so tied up in that, right?

145
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Speaker 5:  Because like the promise Google has been making about this push to AI is

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,160
Speaker 5:  you're gonna be able to buy a piece of hardware and as long as it is sufficiently

147
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,880
Speaker 5:  capable, it is going to get better over time. Like actually get better over

148
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,480
Speaker 5:  time, which is a thing we've been saying for years. Never buy a product based

149
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Speaker 5:  on future promises, but like the promise of AI is

150
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,200
Speaker 5:  that it will get better over time. Literally as you use it, it will

151
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,960
Speaker 5:  get better. And that's compelling. But I think the, the Pixel

152
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,880
Speaker 5:  seven didn't really do that. And I think Alison wrote that

153
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,760
Speaker 5:  piece like six months after the Pixel seven came out being like, yeah, this

154
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,520
Speaker 5:  phone still pretty good. It's really not any better. Like

155
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Speaker 5:  Google does the feature drops, it adds new stuff, the models get better,

156
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,320
Speaker 5:  whatever. But there hasn't been anything that sort of changed the game there.

157
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,400
Speaker 5:  And I like the reason to worry about this phone is

158
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,080
Speaker 5:  to worry that it is going to be exactly what it is right now, seven years

159
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,840
Speaker 5:  from now. And that is so not the promise Google wants you to believe in.

160
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,280
Speaker 5:  And yeah, I'm, I'm very torn between the two, but like Google at

161
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,120
Speaker 5:  least seems to have made a bunch of good decisions about where it could go.

162
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's just about whether it chooses to keep going that way. When

163
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,960
Speaker 6:  Do we trust Google? Like, like I think that's the thing I keep

164
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,080
Speaker 6:  thinking about is it feels like I'm in like, like when you're in a relationship

165
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,800
Speaker 6:  and somebody breaks your trust and you're like, how do I go back to trusting

166
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,680
Speaker 6:  you? Right? Like in real life, it, it's a long journey. It's

167
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,400
Speaker 6:  not like you need to start doing these things. And that's usually when we

168
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,440
Speaker 6:  talk about companies, we wanna trust them again. We're like, you need to

169
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,200
Speaker 6:  do this, this, and this. But Google can't do that because it keeps

170
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,600
Speaker 6:  breaking promises. It's like a real Google killed

171
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,480
Speaker 5:  Pixel pass six weeks ago.

172
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,440
Speaker 6:  Right? Like, like how, how do I trust Google

173
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,240
Speaker 6:  again? Because I kind of like, this phone seems really cool. Like part of

174
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,360
Speaker 6:  me wants to, it's just like that best friend where I'm like, I wanna trust

175
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,520
Speaker 6:  you. How

176
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,720
Speaker 4:  I think the answer is, is really narrow. I think it's kind of what David

177
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,640
Speaker 4:  is saying, you're gonna buy this phone on the same cadence. Especially the

178
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,160
Speaker 4:  pro people who buy pro phones I think are on two year cycles,

179
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,240
Speaker 4:  maybe shorter. I think I, I know a lot of pro phone people who are on a one

180
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,280
Speaker 4:  year cycle. I'm on a

181
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,680
Speaker 6:  Three year

182
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,160
Speaker 4:  And, but I That's reasonable. I I think it's the seven years

183
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,600
Speaker 4:  where people are like really, like, it's hard to think of a Google

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,120
Speaker 4:  product except for search and YouTube that has lasted for seven years. Yeah.

185
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:52,800
Speaker 4:  Gmail.

186
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,040
Speaker 5:  That's basically

187
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,280
Speaker 4:  True. Yeah. Like that's kind of what we're working with here. Yeah.

188
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,920
Speaker 4:  Even we got, I got a note today about decoder being in YouTube music and

189
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,280
Speaker 4:  it's like, oh, because they shut down the podcast thing and moved it on.

190
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,000
Speaker 4:  Like even that, like even what you would think of as like basic stuff,

191
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,480
Speaker 4:  they, they just move around on. So the idea that this phone is gonna stay

192
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,360
Speaker 4:  fixed and relevant for seven years, I think it's really important. It's

193
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,920
Speaker 4:  Google saying, okay, the Pixel program is gonna be around for seven years,

194
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,000
Speaker 4:  but like David said, they canceled but Pixel passed six weeks before this.

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,160
Speaker 4:  So yeah, who knows?

196
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,480
Speaker 6:  So really it's just, it is that waiting game then It is like that that best

197
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,080
Speaker 6:  friend. Yeah. I just

198
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,840
Speaker 4:  Thought that was like in Allison's entire review, like that was the framing

199
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,720
Speaker 4:  that got me. Like it's the right framing. Like here's a bunch of betts Google

200
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,080
Speaker 4:  is taking, some of these thoughts are finished. That's really remarkable.

201
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,520
Speaker 4:  Google doesn't finish a lot of thoughts and some of the thoughts on the phone

202
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,440
Speaker 4:  are, are finished. But the fact that it's like a vessel of Google

203
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,520
Speaker 4:  services and Google AI means you have to believe Yeah. That that

204
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,320
Speaker 4:  stuff will persist for quite a long time. You have to believe that this ecosystem

205
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,920
Speaker 4:  is gonna get richer, richer and richer and richer for a long time in a way

206
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,400
Speaker 4:  that even the Samsung ecosystem is now that I have a, like a long train commute,

207
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,080
Speaker 4:  I gotta say I'm getting Seaford pilled. I'm like, what if I don't bring a

208
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,000
Speaker 4:  laptop and I have a Galaxy fold and then I use decks at the office. And I've

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,960
Speaker 4:  thought like I'm like, that ecosystem is, they just kept at it. What if

210
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,560
Speaker 4:  you bring in and now it's just waiting for me.

211
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,640
Speaker 6:  You do an iPad

212
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,320
Speaker 4:  Every time I get on this? No, no, no, no, no. No decks. It gotta be

213
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,640
Speaker 6:  It's gotta be decks. It's gotta be

214
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,520
Speaker 4:  Decks. No, 'cause what I want is to not carry a backpack. Okay. I just want,

215
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,600
Speaker 4:  I just wanna roll onto the train like a ninja You know. Like an

216
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,680
Speaker 4:  assassin. No backpack, no bag, nothing. Like who is

217
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,640
Speaker 4:  this guy in the morning commuting to New York City with nothing coffee.

218
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,800
Speaker 6:  At least maybe,

219
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,720
Speaker 4:  Maybe even that just like who what? Just because that is a power,

220
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,920
Speaker 4:  especially when it's warmer and you're not even wearing a coat,

221
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,840
Speaker 6:  You just flip the phone out as dramatically as

222
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,160
Speaker 4:  Possible. Everybody has something except for me. I've got a folding phone.

223
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,440
Speaker 4:  Would you like to see my tablet? It used to be my phone. And then I get to

224
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,640
Speaker 4:  the office, I still have nothing. You are the only person in the elevator

225
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,520
Speaker 4:  in our building without a bag. And you just like confidently

226
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,320
Speaker 4:  walk to one of our like weird rotating desk and you sit down, you're like,

227
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,400
Speaker 4:  boop, boop. I have a computer now. It's not a great computer.

228
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,480
Speaker 4:  It's not super functional.

229
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,040
Speaker 6:  The Slack experience is probably better.

230
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,240
Speaker 4:  Probably. Yeah. Because Slack hasn't been updated for decks. Yeah, you're

231
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,200
Speaker 6:  You. That's good.

232
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,120
Speaker 4:  We, we'll now spend the rest of the show complaining about the Slack redesign,

233
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,080
Speaker 6:  Get excited. But

234
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah, all I'm saying is Samsung like kept chipping away at that

235
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,880
Speaker 4:  ecosystem such that even if it's a bad idea,

236
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,160
Speaker 4:  it feels like a good idea now. Right? You're not like an early adopter of

237
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,880
Speaker 4:  this. You're like down the road with it and you can read all the blog posts

238
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,640
Speaker 4:  about how to make it work for you or talk to Dan. Two choices. I

239
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,400
Speaker 4:  with the Pixel, it's like everything is new all the time. Yeah. So that's,

240
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,880
Speaker 4:  that's the thing that really got me. It does seem like the camera sort of

241
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,080
Speaker 4:  divorced from the AI editing stuff. The camera is good. I think Allison

242
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,600
Speaker 4:  said it's a Pixel camera when it's great, it's great. And then when it fails

243
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,240
Speaker 4:  it, it's very predictable how it fails. I think these cameras year over year

244
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,200
Speaker 4:  are almost like imperceptibly different. Like didn didn't review the

245
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,920
Speaker 4:  iPhone 15 this year. So I tried to do a thing where I

246
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,840
Speaker 4:  tried to not pay attention to what was new for my 14 just

247
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,760
Speaker 4:  to see what jumped out. And it's nothing. It's nothing. And I, when I

248
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,240
Speaker 4:  go look, I mean I obviously know there's stuff I'm excited about U S P C.

249
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,640
Speaker 4:  Very cool. I had to buy all new cables. Very cool. But it's like, it's so

250
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,240
Speaker 4:  imperceptibly different. It's the Zoom lens is really nice in low light.

251
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,400
Speaker 4:  It's a little bit You know sweaters are a little more sweater moody. Yeah.

252
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,560
Speaker 6:  So soft.

253
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,280
Speaker 4:  But I, I think it's the same way with the Pixel two. It it, both of these

254
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,200
Speaker 4:  phones I think are imperceptibly better year over year. I

255
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,440
Speaker 4:  just come back to the AI thing and I know I was like ranting and raving last

256
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,120
Speaker 4:  week and I received a lot of feedback. And the feedback is

257
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,960
Speaker 4:  uniformly in two camps, this is the end of all trusted

258
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,720
Speaker 4:  information and we should be more careful or you couldn't trust the information

259
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,520
Speaker 4:  anyway. Why do you care now? Yeah, that's it. There's like almost

260
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,320
Speaker 4:  no gray area.

261
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,920
Speaker 5:  Those aren't that different. Yeah. Like those might actually be on one side

262
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,440
Speaker 5:  of the story.

263
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,080
Speaker 4:  And I, I just think that's really interesting. I, again, you can say a lot

264
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,480
Speaker 4:  of people are like, he hates Google. It's like, no, it's, I'm just saying

265
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,600
Speaker 4:  if you can ship photos that demonstrably did not happen and no one knows

266
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Speaker 4:  except for you. And as David pointed out, like a lot of the feedback is like

267
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,320
Speaker 4:  what I know when you have that feeling that something important is happening

268
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,120
Speaker 4:  there, right? The feeling is, oh, I'm lying to everyone. Like

269
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,880
Speaker 4:  that's the feeling. That's, there's not anything else. You're not being totally

270
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,640
Speaker 4:  honest and You know. That's all I'm saying like that something along

271
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,720
Speaker 4:  the way should quell that feeling just so you can communicate, oh, this

272
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,680
Speaker 4:  photo is in a metadata in a way that can't be stripped or don't

273
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,600
Speaker 4:  do. This is another choice. I will say I took on my Instagram,

274
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,600
Speaker 4:  there's, I took a photo of Max and I eating ice cream. You can go look at

275
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,360
Speaker 4:  it and there's people in the background and I thought to myself, boy, I'd

276
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,080
Speaker 4:  like to delete those people, but You know I didn't do it because

277
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,960
Speaker 4:  I, I can't then come back on the show. I

278
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,800
Speaker 4:  boxed myself into a non-AI generative corner. What if you'd heel

279
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,760
Speaker 4:  heel brushed them out? Yeah. Or just replace them fully. Yeah, just,

280
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,600
Speaker 5:  Just the whole guy in front of them. It just, for

281
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,080
Speaker 4:  Some reason David and Alex are in the background of all of my photos.

282
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,160
Speaker 4:  All. right. Tell me about the Quest three real quick. That's the thing I

283
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,760
Speaker 4:  really wanted to hear about

284
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,800
Speaker 5:  So. I had this really interesting experience with the Quest three, which

285
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Speaker 5:  is like, it's two different headsets in one headset.

286
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,120
Speaker 5:  On the one hand it is like the third Quest, right? It's, it's a VR headset

287
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,800
Speaker 5:  that does VR headset things and it does them like

288
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,240
Speaker 5:  shockingly well. I had this experience the first time I put on the headset

289
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,720
Speaker 5:  of things looked right. I didn't have to spend half an hour like

290
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,280
Speaker 5:  dialing in the little things. I didn't have to move it around a bunch of

291
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,760
Speaker 5:  my head. It just like looked good. And it's crazy how much that

292
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,760
Speaker 5:  upgrade in display quality, which it has, it's the best looking Quest

293
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,840
Speaker 5:  by a mile ever, including the Quest Pro. And just like changes everything.

294
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,000
Speaker 5:  It's more fun to do things. It's more fun to look at menus. I find myself

295
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,320
Speaker 5:  like using the headset longer. It has more games, it has more processing

296
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,720
Speaker 5:  power. So like it's a better VR headset in all the ways you would want it

297
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,480
Speaker 5:  to be our VR headset. But then on the other hand, Meta is out here

298
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,320
Speaker 5:  being like, this is the first mainstream mixed reality headset. And I just

299
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Speaker 5:  found myself the whole time doing this review of being like, what does that

300
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,160
Speaker 5:  mean? It has new pass through. It uses these cameras in a depth sensor to

301
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,080
Speaker 5:  like better map the world around you and see what's going on. And you can

302
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,400
Speaker 5:  interact with the world through your headset. That's all true and all cool.

303
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,400
Speaker 5:  And there is precisely one good mixed reality

304
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,960
Speaker 5:  experience I had on the whole thing. And it's the demo app that shows you

305
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,720
Speaker 5:  how to use mixed reality. Like it's called first encounter and it's

306
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,400
Speaker 5:  sick. It's so fun. There's like, like I played it mostly

307
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,400
Speaker 5:  down here and it's, it starts with coming from your ceiling, there's a little

308
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,040
Speaker 5:  alien craft and it actually makes a thing that looks like a hole in your

309
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,800
Speaker 5:  ceiling. And then aliens just blow holes in all your walls and you have to

310
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,640
Speaker 5:  fight them. It's so fun. It lasts like eight minutes and then it's like,

311
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,400
Speaker 5:  go have fun on your headset. And I'm like, I what else, what do I do here?

312
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,680
Speaker 5:  So I landed in this really weird place of like, and I, I argued about this

313
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,720
Speaker 5:  a bunch with Addie and Dan who have done a lot of these headset views for

314
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,560
Speaker 5:  us too. Like on the one hand it's a $500 very good VR

315
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,320
Speaker 5:  headset. Cool. Big upgrade over the Quest two a lot more

316
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,680
Speaker 5:  expensive than the Quest two. On the other hand it has this like amazing

317
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,480
Speaker 5:  new functionality that is essentially not for anything,

318
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,400
Speaker 5:  don't know what to do with that. And,

319
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,960
Speaker 4:  And that's how they're, they're marketing the product.

320
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,000
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That was the same thing we saw with the PS five, right? Like

321
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,240
Speaker 6:  PS five comes out, Astros playroom really, really cool great

322
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,520
Speaker 6:  demos. You're like, oh wow, the controller's so cool. Every other game's

323
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,960
Speaker 6:  just like, yep, that's a controller You know a hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah.

324
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,120
Speaker 6:  But this is like, I feel like a bigger deal because mixed reality

325
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,840
Speaker 6:  is bigger than haptic feedbacks. Probably not a lot of people were buying

326
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,360
Speaker 6:  the PS

327
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,560
Speaker 4:  Five gimme the entire PS five for a metal gig game that never came.

328
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And like dude left You know. Yeah. And like Kojima's gone and like

329
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,720
Speaker 4:  no one's ever gonna use this controller again. Haptic only Nintendo gets

330
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,040
Speaker 4:  to pull the controller trick. Yeah. By the way, I'm sure there are cool haptic

331
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,920
Speaker 4:  PS five games. I only play Madden in Grando in that fine All. right. Just

332
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,440
Speaker 4:  be fine with that.

333
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,280
Speaker 5:  Horizon

334
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:54,760
Speaker 6:  Is

335
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,120
Speaker 4:  Lovely. I get, I get what I want outta this console. It's awesome.

336
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,160
Speaker 4:  Grand Ismo. Let's just talk about, let's just talk about racing seats the

337
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,760
Speaker 4:  rest of the show we're

338
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,080
Speaker 6:  Pivoting.

339
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,800
Speaker 4:  No, I think there's that like the chicken egg problem. Like you need a cheap

340
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,560
Speaker 4:  good mixed reality headset Yeah. For developers to want to come and develop

341
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,760
Speaker 4:  for it. Fine. And the Vision Pro is coming and

342
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,760
Speaker 4:  presumably some of these concepts will grow and the market will grow. I guess

343
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,560
Speaker 4:  my question is that's what everyone wants, right? Everyone wants to do

344
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,520
Speaker 4:  augmented reality. I can't tell if we made the

345
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,600
Speaker 4:  best VR headset ever, but we want to talk about it as though it is not a

346
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Speaker 4:  VR headset means the VR market has come to its logical conclusion.

347
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,040
Speaker 6:  I think it has.

348
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,080
Speaker 5:  I kind of think So I dunno too. I think I, I don't know if it's come to its

349
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,760
Speaker 5:  logical conclusion. I think it's very clear that it has a ceiling and that

350
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,880
Speaker 5:  that ceiling is fairly low. Like I, I don't think

351
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,200
Speaker 5:  this headset as much better as it is, is going to make people who never

352
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,760
Speaker 5:  wanted headsets, want headsets. Right. And like if you take the diagram

353
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,560
Speaker 5:  of headset people and all people,

354
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,640
Speaker 5:  it's headset people is like a teeny tiny sliver, right? It's like people

355
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,960
Speaker 5:  who had smartphones in like 2002

356
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,640
Speaker 5:  because I was one of those people and it ruled and my smartphone was

357
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,640
Speaker 5:  a piece of junk and I had it because like I am that kind of person. But it

358
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,520
Speaker 5:  took a long time for like the world to become smartphone

359
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,440
Speaker 5:  people. And then we're there with headsets, right? Where there's like, there's

360
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,920
Speaker 5:  this much market share for people who want

361
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,480
Speaker 5:  headsets to do VR things, right? It's like it's a gaming thing and it

362
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,480
Speaker 5:  is harder to use and access than a lot of gaming things. So it it's, it's

363
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,160
Speaker 5:  a small group. If you believe as a lot of people in tech do that,

364
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,160
Speaker 5:  the future is glasses that we are all eventually going to wear something

365
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,040
Speaker 5:  on our face. You are never going to get anywhere close to that with mostly

366
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,440
Speaker 5:  a VR product. I think you're right that Meta is just out here saying like

367
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,640
Speaker 5:  this is the start of it. Like this is the, the what the Oculus dev kit

368
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,640
Speaker 5:  was You know 11 years ago. This is now that

369
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,680
Speaker 5:  except they want you very badly to buy it. But the thing that really

370
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,360
Speaker 5:  confuses me is that at the very beginning when Meta decided

371
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,160
Speaker 5:  it was all in on vr, back when it was Oculus and Facebook was Facebook,

372
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,240
Speaker 5:  the company went way out of its way to like juice this ecosystem.

373
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,840
Speaker 5:  It bought every company it could think of. It had this like crazy

374
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,640
Speaker 5:  flood of content. It like single-handedly made the VR

375
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,520
Speaker 5:  ecosystem an ecosystem. I don't see any of that happening in mixed reality

376
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,920
Speaker 5:  now. Even all the cool stuff coming, there's a bunch of cool games coming.

377
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,960
Speaker 5:  There's an Assassin's Creed game coming. If

378
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,560
Speaker 4:  There's, if no game console shall exist No. Without Assassin's Creed. It's

379
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,240
Speaker 4:  illegal. Yeah.

380
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,160
Speaker 5:  If you don't get it in six months, just throw in the track.

381
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,120
Speaker 4:  Jeff. Ito's not stabbing you. Nothing is happening,

382
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,680
Speaker 5:  But all the stuff that's coming is VR games. Addie

383
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,120
Speaker 5:  kept making the case to me that maybe the problem here is that even Meta

384
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,720
Speaker 5:  is not sure what mixed reality is for, especially in a headset you're not

385
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,240
Speaker 5:  likely to like wear out into the world. And I think she's probably right

386
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,040
Speaker 5:  about that. So it's like, this is like a, a very cool VR headset with a tech

387
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,600
Speaker 5:  demo on top of it. And

388
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,560
Speaker 6:  That tech demo was also like, wasn't that a Magic Leap Tech demo years

389
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,360
Speaker 6:  ago? Or it was like it was part of their

390
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,480
Speaker 4:  Oh the Aliens. Yeah,

391
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,120
Speaker 6:  The Aliens. 'cause it was, but it was an office and you're like, ah, in the

392
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,800
Speaker 6:  office. And I was like, that's cool, right? So it's exciting. I can do that

393
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,800
Speaker 6:  now. Not with like glasses and a little backpack, but

394
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,840
Speaker 5:  It's something like, it's fun. The the first encounter thing is like legit

395
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,200
Speaker 5:  fun.

396
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,000
Speaker 4:  Would you say that it hacked the g p u of your brain, which is what Magic

397
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,760
Speaker 4:  Leap used to say

398
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,160
Speaker 5:  About the teeny tiny like sliver of field of view that you would

399
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,680
Speaker 5:  get in the Magic Leap headset? Yeah.

400
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,800
Speaker 4:  I was just never, ever forget, I believe this was like a wired

401
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,960
Speaker 4:  covered story, right?

402
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,520
Speaker 5:  Kevin Kelly wrote about it.

403
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,280
Speaker 4:  It was like we, we used the Magic Leap and there were just a line in it

404
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,280
Speaker 4:  where they refused to describe how their technology worked. Magic.

405
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,000
Speaker 4:  Like the poor y reporter, like we asked how the technology worked and they

406
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,520
Speaker 4:  wouldn't say, they just kept saying things like, it hacks the G p U of your

407
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,440
Speaker 4:  brain. It was just incredible. Like if only I could

408
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,080
Speaker 4:  say things like that more consistently, right? You know it'd be great.

409
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:58,760
Speaker 4:  I mean

410
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,320
Speaker 6:  The Meta

411
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,080
Speaker 4:  Three The Verge, it hacks the g p U of your brain.

412
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,320
Speaker 4:  That's,

413
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,480
Speaker 5:  That's pretty good, honestly.

414
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I So I agree with you about this VR thing. Every compelling demo even

415
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,400
Speaker 4:  of the Vision Pro, every compelling idea for these products is virtual

416
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,320
Speaker 4:  reality. Yeah. There, there just isn't one. The You know the,

417
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
Speaker 4:  the videos of the Vision Pro or the Quest Pro before it, where

418
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,320
Speaker 4:  you're at a table and you've put five giant monitors in front of you on

419
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,000
Speaker 4:  the table. It's like You know that requires an empty table.

420
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,880
Speaker 4:  Why? Why would you have, why like inside your house is a

421
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,960
Speaker 4:  bad mixed reality environment? 'cause it is likely that you don't just

422
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,920
Speaker 4:  have like empty rooms.

423
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,160
Speaker 6:  I got the idea,

424
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,960
Speaker 4:  The dystopian vision of Mark Zucker being like, here's what's gonna happen

425
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,720
Speaker 4:  in the future. People will live in gigantic empty homes and my virtual

426
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,720
Speaker 4:  objects will fill those homes and to move around your house and do anything,

427
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,760
Speaker 4:  you will wear my headset

428
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,080
Speaker 6:  And buy my NFTs.

429
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,440
Speaker 4:  But that's just like, is that, is that right? Is that why we're all chasing

430
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,960
Speaker 4:  it? So you can buy TVs from the, the Facebook store? I don't know like that.

431
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,800
Speaker 4:  You gotta give me some reason to wanna wear this thing in my house. And all

432
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,080
Speaker 4:  the reasons in the house are virtual reality reasons.

433
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,600
Speaker 6:  I got one, I got a mixed reality. It's

434
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,640
Speaker 4:  Grand Jury, Ismo and Supernatural,

435
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:12,240
Speaker 6:  They haven't released yet, but they got to like car and

436
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,040
Speaker 6:  computer repair mixed reality. Like you just put it on and you look down,

437
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,920
Speaker 6:  it's like, oh yeah, you no

438
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,080
Speaker 4:  I

439
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,760
Speaker 6:  Fix it. Yeah, you you messed that up. Do that. Yeah.

440
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,080
Speaker 4:  That's all it's gonna say is, boy, those screws are smaller than you thought.

441
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,840
Speaker 4:  Huh? Yeah. You didn't, you don't have a bowl, do you? You

442
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,200
Speaker 4:  forgot a bowl. You're just hoping they don't roll away and

443
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Speaker 6:  It's just like a little thing up at the top showing you what actually you

444
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,080
Speaker 6:  need to do. Yeah. Versus whatever the instructions say. Like I would buy

445
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,600
Speaker 6:  a headset in a heartbeat if it did that for Ikea

446
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,440
Speaker 6:  furniture plumbing. I don't know how to plum

447
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,800
Speaker 5:  Alex. I have such good news for you. I'd like to tell you about a product

448
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,720
Speaker 5:  called Google Glass, which exists still in this world

449
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,880
Speaker 5:  I know today exists to do exactly the thing you're describing. It's not for

450
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,480
Speaker 5:  you, it's for like people who repair airplanes and stuff. It's not for people

451
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,040
Speaker 5:  who put together IKEA furniture, which to be fair would be sick. I

452
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,800
Speaker 6:  Want it for my house.

453
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,120
Speaker 4:  No, wait, hold on, hold on. Excuse me. I'm sorry. My Google clock

454
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,600
Speaker 4:  dinged. You are wrong. Google Glass has been discontinued.

455
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,320
Speaker 4:  No, may March 15th, 2023 Google Enterprise has stopped being sold.

456
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,440
Speaker 4:  That was their market. They pivoted into. Okay. But

457
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,040
Speaker 5:  People are still using it. Oh sure.

458
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,520
Speaker 4:  I'm sure Somewhere there's a mechanic being like, man I hope this airplane

459
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,440
Speaker 4:  database is up to date. Can you imagine you roll

460
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,640
Speaker 5:  Into Jiffy Lube and the guy's like, lemme take a look and just flips his

461
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
Speaker 5:  Google glass down all his

462
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,720
Speaker 4:  Head. Yeah. I will say the first ever HoloLens demo I took at

463
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,280
Speaker 4:  Microsoft, they made me wear a HoloLens and I replaced a spark plug in an

464
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,960
Speaker 4:  A T V by walking around in a room.

465
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,960
Speaker 6:  I I I fixed some plumbing.

466
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,440
Speaker 4:  Oh see issue that was, and my question to them, which in

467
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,360
Speaker 4:  retrospect was not as rude as it should have been, was if you are a mechanic

468
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,680
Speaker 4:  and you have a shop full of tools and someone has brought you

469
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,280
Speaker 4:  their a t v, wouldn't you already know how to fix the spark plug?

470
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,200
Speaker 6:  But that's why this is perfect for consumers because I would

471
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,560
Speaker 6:  not, I have a vague understanding, but you wouldn't,

472
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,360
Speaker 4:  You wouldn't be in a position where like you were perfectly ready

473
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,240
Speaker 4:  to replace a spark plug and your face computer was like,

474
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,680
Speaker 4:  now walk 30 steps to the left and get this wrench. Like if all

475
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,280
Speaker 4:  of that is ready to go and you've spent the time to set that up,

476
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,720
Speaker 4:  like, and you don't know how to fix the spark plug, like your, your priorities

477
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,640
Speaker 4:  are just upside down.

478
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,440
Speaker 6:  But that is exactly what I would do in real life.

479
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,920
Speaker 4:  That's true. It's true. It's like,

480
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,440
Speaker 6:  Like think a hundred percent. Yeah. I've got everything ready. I Google that.

481
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,200
Speaker 6:  I didn't Google how to actually do the thing. Right. I just googled the prep.

482
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,160
Speaker 5:  But luckily YouTube exists and I'm sure there is a middle-aged man

483
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,320
Speaker 5:  with boots on who will teach you how to do anything you can think of.

484
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:42,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

485
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,520
Speaker 6:  But I want him in mixed reality showing me and then being like, Alex, that's

486
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,480
Speaker 6:  terrible. What are you doing the other direction?

487
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,840
Speaker 4:  This is what, this is like the true promise of ai. Yeah. That's is synthesizing

488
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,680
Speaker 4:  YouTube fix it guy to look through your eyes

489
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,360
Speaker 4:  and he should be played by T-pain.

490
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,440
Speaker 6:  Never hire an AC repair guy. And

491
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,360
Speaker 4:  You say we don't have ideas in the Birch cast. This is how you hack the G

492
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,280
Speaker 4:  p U of the brain. We did it guys tpa, generative AI plumber.

493
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,920
Speaker 4:  Just being like, that's not how you fix a toilet. Alex.

494
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,160
Speaker 6:  Perfect.

495
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,080
Speaker 4:  It's true by the way that those enterprise products existed. They thought

496
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,920
Speaker 4:  that would be a huge market, right? You've got a, you're a a baby mechanic

497
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,080
Speaker 4:  for Delta, you gotta fix a thing. I don't

498
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,440
Speaker 6:  What you

499
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,400
Speaker 4:  And that that's what they thought. And none of them worked out. I just say

500
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,400
Speaker 4:  I I keep coming back to this basic idea. The thing they

501
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,080
Speaker 4:  all wanna build is glasses. And the thing they keep trying to sell is virtual

502
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,360
Speaker 4:  reality and glasses and virtual reality are non-compatible. Correct.

503
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:37,920
Speaker 6:  That's

504
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,720
Speaker 4:  True. And so it, it's when I say like, is this the end of the VR market?

505
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,400
Speaker 4:  Like you, you have to make the turn. You have to stop doing VR

506
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,240
Speaker 4:  games. You have to stop. Supernatural is entirely vr. You have to stop telling

507
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,880
Speaker 4:  people that you're gonna get on an airplane with your $3,500 vision pro in

508
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,840
Speaker 4:  a battery pack in your back pocket and you're gonna watch a movie in vr.

509
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,360
Speaker 4:  'cause if your eventual goal is to ship glasses, you won't be

510
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,720
Speaker 4:  able to do that anymore. 'cause you won't be able to block out the world

511
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,320
Speaker 4:  around you. And I, I Don, I, it just seems like

512
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,960
Speaker 4:  everyone knows this problem is there. It's not like a secret problem. This

513
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,520
Speaker 4:  is not some grand insight that they gotta solve. VR requires you to block

514
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,480
Speaker 4:  out the world around you. But like how are you gonna do it? Yeah.

515
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,120
Speaker 6:  They just gotta move headsets for, for the holidays. So so let's talk about

516
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,960
Speaker 6:  the VR part because that's what kids can actually use right now. Yeah.

517
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,400
Speaker 6:  And sell it. And then I think that's always the plan is like vr, vr, vr.

518
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,120
Speaker 6:  And then one day they'll be like, okay, the glasses are ready, vrs over there

519
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,040
Speaker 6:  if you want it, you can get that. Or you can spend $4,000

520
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,360
Speaker 6:  on these glasses and t-pain will be in your ear and like

521
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,720
Speaker 4:  Confined. Finally, finally, someone has a killer app that does not require

522
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,280
Speaker 4:  facial recognition. See we did it. It's angry T-Pain the plumber,

523
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,400
Speaker 4:  we

524
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:44,800
Speaker 6:  Fixed

525
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,240
Speaker 4:  It by the way I I say this for maybe the a hundred times of her Chest T-pain

526
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,400
Speaker 4:  rules. And if he ever wants to come on the show, he's more than welcome.

527
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,960
Speaker 4:  Just putting that out there. We should talk about Threads really quickly

528
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,080
Speaker 4:  just before we move to a break. There's just Twitter and Threads news

529
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,840
Speaker 4:  in the world. There's a war going on between Israel and

530
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,570
Speaker 4:  Hamas. Twitter did not do great in that

531
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,970
Speaker 4:  circumstance. Every time Twitter does not do great. A flood of people comes

532
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,450
Speaker 4:  to Threads and then we all have to contend with Adam Ary

533
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,690
Speaker 4:  talking about news on Threads, which he should just stop doing.

534
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,250
Speaker 4:  I, that's just my free advice to Adam Sary. 'cause he keeps saying things

535
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,010
Speaker 4:  like, it's not that we don't want news, it's that we're gonna prioritize

536
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,970
Speaker 4:  everything else. Anything but news is my priority. Does that make

537
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,650
Speaker 4:  sense to you? It's not that we don't want it even though you keep asking

538
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,490
Speaker 4:  for it and doing it and boy do you keep doing it. It's just that I don't

539
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,690
Speaker 4:  want to prioritize it in any way, shape or form. And it's like You know

540
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,360
Speaker 4:  that that it silence.

541
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,640
Speaker 6:  Silence is good.

542
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,600
Speaker 4:  It's not that I don't want to turn up the volume on this channel, it's that

543
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,280
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna turn up all the other channels as loud as I can so that this channel

544
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,960
Speaker 4:  is effectively zero. Like that's what that looks like.

545
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,920
Speaker 6:  Yeah. He needs to just stop talking about news until he actually has some

546
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,840
Speaker 6:  news about this. I I don't

547
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Speaker 4:  So I So I think he's sincere. I like Adam. Yeah. He's been on Decoder before.

548
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,240
Speaker 4:  I think he's even been on The Verge house before I I think he's sincere.

549
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,960
Speaker 4:  I think Meta got burned by what you might call the great

550
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,520
Speaker 4:  Facebook news experiment

551
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,680
Speaker 5:  And also like burned the world. He the world. It's useful to remember that

552
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,520
Speaker 5:  asking Meta to do more news has not historically been a good idea for like

553
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,920
Speaker 5:  the earth. Yes.

554
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. There's a lot of wreckage in what you might call the millennial media

555
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,400
Speaker 4:  ravine. Let's name some brands that don't exist. Buzzfeed news

556
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,840
Speaker 4:  mike.com, like generally vice in its previous

557
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,680
Speaker 4:  incarnation. It's just true. I mean like all the the, those are all huge

558
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,840
Speaker 4:  betts on Facebook news distribution or Facebook video distribution.

559
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,000
Speaker 4:  You can just go look at the Wikipedia page where the words pivot to video.

560
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,880
Speaker 4:  We all live through it and that was Facebook sent floods of

561
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,440
Speaker 4:  traffic, web traffic to publishers and then they stopped and they started

562
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,200
Speaker 4:  saying the future of the internet is video. Which I will grant them broadly

563
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,200
Speaker 4:  True. That was true. People like watching video who

564
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,040
Speaker 4:  knew you can get it from a streaming service.

565
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,440
Speaker 4:  You can get it from Alex's plex server. Yeah. Or you can get it from a social

566
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,680
Speaker 4:  platform and most people pick social platforms so that's fine. But, but Facebook

567
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,480
Speaker 4:  like led a bunch of companies off a cliff basically in terms of revenue.

568
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,000
Speaker 4:  And I think Adam doesn't wanna do that again. And he keeps saying, I don't

569
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,680
Speaker 4:  wanna overpromise and underdeliver cynically. What you might respond to that

570
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,520
Speaker 4:  with is then don't break your promises. That's just a thing

571
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,720
Speaker 4:  you could say. Well I think

572
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,320
Speaker 6:  It's important to remember what people are asking for isn't like give us

573
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,320
Speaker 6:  algorithms that control the news, which leads to all the things that

574
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,160
Speaker 6:  happen when Facebook did that. And they're not asking for pivoting to

575
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,280
Speaker 6:  video or any of the other things. They're just saying like give us better

576
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,720
Speaker 6:  hashtag support. Yeah. So if I wanna follow something

577
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,440
Speaker 6:  breaking in the world, I can And it doesn't have to be bad, it can be sports

578
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,880
Speaker 6:  and, and so like that's the really interesting thing that's happening

579
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,960
Speaker 6:  here to me is, is just co completing completely rolling all of

580
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,640
Speaker 6:  that in together. And I'm like, Adam, I promise you whatever's happening

581
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,360
Speaker 6:  in Marvel or

582
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,280
Speaker 4:  Like talking directly to Adam,

583
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,160
Speaker 6:  Sorry or N F L is not the same as whatever's happening in the

584
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,920
Speaker 6:  larger world with with conflicts and stuff like that. Like those are different

585
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,960
Speaker 6:  types of news. People just want a way to be like, oh something

586
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,240
Speaker 6:  happening. What?

587
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I, but again, I think they've been burned by this idea in the past.

588
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,520
Speaker 4:  Right. And I think again, in no way is criticism of X the

589
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,400
Speaker 4:  company praise for criticism of the previous administration of Twitter

590
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,280
Speaker 4:  the company. But I think you can look at it and say maybe that horrible

591
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,560
Speaker 4:  clown car was the best it could ever be and we don't wanna do that. We wanna

592
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,600
Speaker 4:  build something bigger. I think they're sincere about that. All that said,

593
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,440
Speaker 4:  I don't think that they're ever gonna do news. I think that adversary says

594
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,560
Speaker 4:  that they're not gonna do news over and over again 'cause they don't wanna

595
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,320
Speaker 4:  do it. It's, and again his, he's not saying they want to or they're gonna

596
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,000
Speaker 4:  block it. Although they have some very restrictive moderation policies that

597
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,720
Speaker 4:  seem like they don't wanna do. Like you can't talk about Covid on Threads

598
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,760
Speaker 4:  really. It's just like not a thing you're allowed to do. Right. You know,

599
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,720
Speaker 4:  I think they're gonna prioritize sports coverage and fashion and culture

600
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,680
Speaker 4:  and whatever and they will accidentally build tools that are reasonably good

601
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,320
Speaker 4:  for news. But the idea that the way that Twitter was just sort of the

602
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,600
Speaker 4:  assignment editor for the media and the Trump era, I think they would prefer

603
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,680
Speaker 4:  Threads to not be that thing

604
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,480
Speaker 6:  That I'm okay with. Like that's the kind of thing where I'm like, okay, yeah,

605
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,640
Speaker 6:  we don't need that. There are other ways to get this. And frankly, having

606
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,200
Speaker 6:  all of your, your really good reports appearing in like

607
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,160
Speaker 6:  148 characters on a website is not the best way to deliver a

608
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,960
Speaker 6:  lot of news. And we need to move past that. That seems yeah,

609
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,200
Speaker 6:  fine. Let's do that.

610
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,760
Speaker 4:  This is the time in the broadcast where I start talking about ActivityPub.

611
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,800
Speaker 4:  This is the point. Yeah. Everyone's making a huge mistake. You don't want

612
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,280
Speaker 4:  Twitter again, it wasn't great. It just wasn't good. Yeah. Like

613
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,120
Speaker 4:  just fundamentally

614
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,960
Speaker 6:  Bad. It

615
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,640
Speaker 4:  Was not, it was not a great time for a handful of guys

616
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,080
Speaker 4:  to be in charge of a handful of platforms that dominated our

617
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,800
Speaker 4:  information ecosystem. So the point, and I think that the,

618
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,760
Speaker 4:  the better thing to do is hold Instagram and

619
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,520
Speaker 4:  Meta to their promises around Federation and ActivityPub, which

620
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,840
Speaker 4:  they continually say they're gonna do like their engineers on the platform

621
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,120
Speaker 4:  saying they're gonna do it. Their representative to the W three Cs on there

622
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,200
Speaker 4:  saying they're gonna do it. Ari says they're gonna do it. Zuckerberg said

623
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,960
Speaker 4:  to Alex Heath a couple weeks ago, they're gonna do it. They keep saying they're

624
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,400
Speaker 4:  gonna do it, they haven't done it. So you gotta hold them to that promise

625
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,120
Speaker 4:  and then you have to build products that interoperate and allow you

626
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,320
Speaker 4:  to address the Threads audience with news products or allow you to build

627
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,240
Speaker 4:  news products that use content from Threads in new and interesting ways.

628
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,600
Speaker 5:  I agree with that. I also think you just made the exact case

629
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,600
Speaker 5:  why Meta wants to do this because Meta federating

630
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,760
Speaker 5:  lets it wash its hands of every complicated thing it doesn't feel like dealing

631
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,520
Speaker 5:  with. Right. And So I think it's just going to be true that

632
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,400
Speaker 5:  Threads is the biggest thing in the Fedi verse or the

633
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,920
Speaker 5:  open social web or whatever you wanna call it. Like the day it does, it will

634
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,800
Speaker 5:  be the dominant player on ActivityPub and probably will be for a

635
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,640
Speaker 5:  long time. And so it's still going to have this

636
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,520
Speaker 5:  same set of responsibilities. And I think just to be able to say it's like

637
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,720
Speaker 5:  Google saying you can use a different search engine, right? It's just like,

638
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,440
Speaker 5:  it's not, it's true but it's not the reality of

639
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,280
Speaker 5:  being alive. Most people are gonna be

640
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,200
Speaker 5:  on Threads doing this stuff and like Adam er and his team still have

641
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,880
Speaker 5:  incentives and I think responsibilities to get this stuff right.

642
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,360
Speaker 5:  But I think like what he means when he says we don't want to do news

643
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,560
Speaker 5:  is literally, it's like the the knob that says news that's on

644
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,120
Speaker 5:  his desk, he is going to keep dialing it down. Right? Like yeah, you, your

645
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,960
Speaker 5:  thing about turning up the volume is like a, I think a surprisingly real

646
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,360
Speaker 5:  metaphor. Like I don't think that's actually that far off from what's actually

647
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,240
Speaker 5:  going on. The question is do you care more about like evergreen stuff or

648
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,440
Speaker 5:  do you care more about real time stuff? Right. And Twitter a thing it did

649
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,280
Speaker 5:  right? Was it found that balance really, really, really well. It's

650
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,120
Speaker 5:  really hard to do the thing where you divide between what is good And, what

651
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,080
Speaker 5:  is now and and Twitter hit that balance better than I think any

652
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,600
Speaker 5:  other platform ever has. Which is why it was so good at that. You could even

653
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Speaker 5:  go on the algorithmic timeline and it would still show you new stuff.

654
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,440
Speaker 5:  I don't think Threads is ever going to push as far down that

655
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,040
Speaker 5:  realtime road ever as Twitter did. Yeah. I just don't see it. I have

656
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,880
Speaker 6:  One question about all of this and it was something I actually saw on Threads

657
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,520
Speaker 6:  and I think it was maybe from you or maybe response to Adversary,

658
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,200
Speaker 6:  why are we focused so much on Threads and how it handles

659
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,040
Speaker 6:  news and not focused on TikTok, which by all accounts is a much more

660
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,960
Speaker 6:  widely used platform and it how it handles news because it has a lot

661
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,880
Speaker 6:  of the same kind of like concerns about like what you can and cannot say

662
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,200
Speaker 6:  on the platform, but it also has a much bigger audience

663
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,680
Speaker 6:  and it is actually actively algorithmically delivering that news.

664
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,760
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Whatever it is to people, be it accurate or not. And it's kind of an

665
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,240
Speaker 6:  obnoxious, I found to like report when stuff is inaccurate on that platform.

666
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,400
Speaker 6:  Like do I just do a call out TikTok being like, everything this man has said

667
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,160
Speaker 6:  is wrong. Like I've thought about it. But like that

668
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,000
Speaker 6:  for me feels almost a bigger concern than what's happening at

669
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,720
Speaker 6:  Threads. And it's kind of interesting that I think we all talk about it here

670
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,720
Speaker 6:  and I know a lot of people in media talk about it Threads because Twitter

671
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,840
Speaker 6:  was very much like a media thing. Everybody on media used it. And

672
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,560
Speaker 6:  then a lot of people have migrated to Blue Sky to Mastodon now to Threads

673
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,080
Speaker 6:  and they're very much using it there. And a lot of the discourse, the conversation

674
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,840
Speaker 6:  around news is driven by the media on that platform. And it is kind of

675
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,640
Speaker 6:  interesting that we're driving it there and we're kind of ignoring TikTok

676
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,800
Speaker 6:  where the people are actually watching. Yeah. The news.

677
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,120
Speaker 5:  I also think there's something about those platforms that make

678
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,840
Speaker 5:  it feel more like everyone is having a similar

679
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,800
Speaker 5:  experience where I think like on TikTok there's no pretense that what

680
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,760
Speaker 5:  I'm seeing on TikTok is anything like what either of you are seeing on TikTok,

681
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,560
Speaker 5:  right? And so it, it makes this question of like, what is the

682
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,400
Speaker 5:  quote unquote TikTok experience really hard to talk about

683
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,280
Speaker 5:  in a way that these more like participatory

684
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,400
Speaker 5:  messaging things like Twitter and Blue Sky and now Threads, it just

685
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:04,320
Speaker 5:  feels more like everyone is in one place. Whereas these

686
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,000
Speaker 5:  other things, and I think YouTube falls in this category too. Like you

687
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,920
Speaker 5:  don't see on YouTube what I see on YouTube. So it's very hard for

688
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,480
Speaker 5:  us to actually talk about the way YouTube works because everyone's experience

689
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,200
Speaker 5:  of it is so different. But on a place like Threads, it

690
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,040
Speaker 5:  feels more like everyone is there just because it moves so fast that even

691
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,760
Speaker 5:  though the experiences are different it just makes people feel more like

692
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,520
Speaker 5:  they understand it, I think. Yeah.

693
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And there was like, there were universal experiences. We all got the

694
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,000
Speaker 6:  Sexy Ladies for like a week on Threads and we're like, why are you here?

695
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:34,720
Speaker 6:  Stop.

696
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,440
Speaker 4:  I was like, why aren't you here more often?

697
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,720
Speaker 6:  Neil like some sexy favorite app.

698
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,400
Speaker 5:  Mine was just the Nugget account. Yes. Like that was the most universal experience

699
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,840
Speaker 5:  of all was the Nugget account for like three weeks on Threads.

700
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,960
Speaker 4:  Well you didn't just actively interact with the sexy ladies of Threads to

701
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,480
Speaker 4:  bring 'em back more often. You know like crypto, you want it? Oh,

702
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,840
Speaker 4:  oh it's, this is happening, it's fine. I'm nothing but a

703
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,560
Speaker 4:  man. I'm just, the thing about news is like I, here's my other

704
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,620
Speaker 4:  metaphor. You ready? Here's what the media is. The news media

705
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,460
Speaker 4:  is on Threads. We're the mandolin players in a C D C, we All, right?

706
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,460
Speaker 4:  It's not to say there's not a mandolin player at AC d c, maybe there is,

707
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,350
Speaker 4:  you don't know. But there's also ac, C D C,

708
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,260
Speaker 4:  they're not kicking you out. You might, you might be jangling away on that

709
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:23,460
Speaker 4:  thing.

710
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,740
Speaker 6:  It's in the back behind the drum kit

711
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,820
Speaker 4:  And Adam and Sarah's like, look, we're just not gonna amplify the mandolin.

712
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:30,540
Speaker 4:  They

713
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,780
Speaker 6:  Don't get a mic. Yeah.

714
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,420
Speaker 4:  That's, that's all that's happening there. And it's fine. It's a, it's a

715
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,540
Speaker 4:  way to be. But I'm just saying that

716
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,740
Speaker 4:  opportunity, especially when the big player is gonna do federation

717
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,030
Speaker 4:  again, you gotta hold 'em to it. That means you get to rethink all of web

718
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,270
Speaker 4:  distribution. You get to rethink content moderation and to be like, give

719
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,950
Speaker 4:  me trending topics, So, I can one-to-one replace Twitter is like,

720
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,910
Speaker 4:  that's just itty bitty thinking. Yeah.

721
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:54,510
Speaker 5:  Everyone,

722
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,030
Speaker 4:  Everyone think bigger. If you want to, if you're out there building a cool

723
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,630
Speaker 4:  ActivityPub product, just like let us know we're gonna start over covering

724
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,430
Speaker 4:  that stuff just to show people that people are building new interesting products.

725
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,110
Speaker 4:  We'll see. I mean it has to be good. We can't just be sexy ladies in crypto.

726
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:11,150
Speaker 5:  And speaking of ActivityPub, we should say the one, the bit of ActivityPub

727
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,630
Speaker 5:  news this week was that WordPress now officially supports

728
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,830
Speaker 5:  ActivityPub on WordPress dot com accounts. Yeah. And like what

729
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:22,470
Speaker 5:  WordPress is is very confusing. WordPress dot com is only a subset of WordPress

730
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,190
Speaker 5:  and WordPress the company and WordPress. It's like, it's a lot, but a lot

731
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,590
Speaker 5:  of websites can now with one plugin and

732
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,670
Speaker 5:  checkbox interoperate with ActivityPub, which means you can actually push

733
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,390
Speaker 5:  your content to these other places and it's like, that's what this is

734
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,750
Speaker 5:  supposed to look like. Yeah. Right. Like that I think is very exciting and

735
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,390
Speaker 5:  yeah, right is a big start in this narrowly

736
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,990
Speaker 4:  It's, well Threads doesn't do it yet. So if you have a blog and you're like

737
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,710
Speaker 4:  running it, someone can follow you on Mastodon and

738
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,790
Speaker 4:  your post to your blog will show up in their Mastodon feed, right? And it,

739
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,910
Speaker 4:  if they hit like it'll come back to you. That's hugely powerful. You

740
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,670
Speaker 4:  could see how, for example, if a large technology website had a quick

741
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,790
Speaker 4:  posting format, it might make use of such a technology,

742
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,030
Speaker 4:  especially who is migrating toward WordPress in near future. Just an idea

743
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:11,230
Speaker 4:  that I have just a hypothetical for you all to think about. Okay. We should

744
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,950
Speaker 4:  take a break. I want to get David's perspective on his

745
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,710
Speaker 4:  time in the US versus Google courtroom and then Chris

746
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,670
Speaker 4:  Walsh is gonna join us and talk about another Google case, which

747
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,750
Speaker 4:  is handily winning. We'll be right back.

748
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,150
Speaker 8:  Welcome

749
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,950
Speaker 4:  Back to The Vergecast Legal Hour. Or we break down the

750
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:10,710
Speaker 4:  hottest action courtrooms around the country. We should just pivot

751
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,310
Speaker 4:  the show to True crime. Yay. Like that's what does the numbers, that is the

752
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,910
Speaker 4:  dream of the people who run this podcast network. Yeah, that we, we do a

753
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:18,830
Speaker 4:  tech true crime show.

754
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,230
Speaker 4:  They stole my battery bank and I spent the next five years tracking 'em down.

755
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,910
Speaker 4:  Well Chris Welch is here. Hey Chris. Hello. Pleasure to be here. Chris covers,

756
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,510
Speaker 4:  I would say Sonos in to the closest degree possible. I

757
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:32,750
Speaker 4:  think it's

758
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,990
Speaker 8:  Kind of interesting you're here and not currently in the events at Sonos.

759
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,230
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I'll take a break here and there. Okay. So, I wanna talk about what's

760
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,430
Speaker 4:  going on with Google and Sonos. There's big Ruling in that that patent case.

761
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,830
Speaker 4:  It's like a remarkable Ruling, So, I wanna spend some time there. But first

762
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,630
Speaker 4:  there's actually another trial that's ongoing, which we keep talking about

763
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,270
Speaker 4:  United States versus Google. It is a trial claiming that

764
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,030
Speaker 4:  effectively the deals Google makes with other vendors, most

765
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,230
Speaker 4:  notably Apple provide an illegal benefit to its search monopoly.

766
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,070
Speaker 4:  And those deals are bad. David, you've been in and outta that courtroom this

767
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,950
Speaker 4:  trial. If you've been listening to the You know this trial's really hard

768
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,910
Speaker 4:  to cover there. There's no streams, documents and

769
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,630
Speaker 4:  transcripts are hard to come by. There's been drama around that stuff.

770
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,390
Speaker 4:  So we've just been, when we can sending David into the courtroom in DC to

771
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,190
Speaker 4:  watch things go down, watch the various witnesses.

772
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,910
Speaker 4:  This last turn, it made it very clear that as

773
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,910
Speaker 4:  goes Apple goes the search market and it, I think it's like

774
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,160
Speaker 4:  under reported on under noticed that that is like the heart of this whole

775
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,360
Speaker 4:  case.

776
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And ironically, this turn really started with

777
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,240
Speaker 5:  Satya Nadella, the c e O of Microsoft who a lot of people give

778
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,960
Speaker 5:  testimony in these things and they're prepared by a lot of lawyers to not

779
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,120
Speaker 5:  really say anything interesting. And there have been a few witnesses so far

780
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,480
Speaker 5:  who I know have spicy hot takes.

781
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,720
Speaker 5:  Some of them I have written about on The Verge dot com in stories

782
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,600
Speaker 5:  that I'm happy to send you links to who clearly were trained to like sort

783
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,240
Speaker 5:  of do the least in the courtroom. Satya Nadella was not one of those people.

784
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,400
Speaker 5:  Like dude came out swinging and essentially

785
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,040
Speaker 5:  began to make this case that binging is bad. It's worse than Google, but

786
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,720
Speaker 5:  the only reason binging is worse than Google is because of the Apple

787
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,560
Speaker 5:  deal. And that sounds like this like wild impossible

788
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,200
Speaker 5:  to navigate thing. But essentially what the argument has come down to, and

789
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,600
Speaker 5:  a number of people have made this argument and even Google has sort of

790
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,200
Speaker 5:  acknowledged that it understands this in a lot of the evidence that we've

791
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,400
Speaker 5:  seen in the exhibits that are being published. It, it's essentially that

792
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,400
Speaker 5:  if you can be the default search engine in Safari, which Google

793
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,280
Speaker 5:  has been for 20 years, for as long as there has been a safari, you will get

794
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:44,640
Speaker 5:  such market share so quickly and so many more

795
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,880
Speaker 5:  searches. Like I I, I have like learned how things like

796
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,720
Speaker 5:  query flow work and basically the like flywheel of the

797
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,960
Speaker 5:  more searches you get, the better the searches are. Thus you can make more

798
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Speaker 5:  searches, thus you do better, thus you get more search like on and on and

799
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,960
Speaker 5:  on. And if anyone could break in,

800
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,040
Speaker 5:  overwhelmingly the industry seems to think there would be real

801
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,200
Speaker 5:  serious competitors to Google

802
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:13,960
Speaker 5:  essentially overnight. And that by not getting out

803
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,560
Speaker 5:  of its deal with Google or letting anybody else in Duck, duck go apparently

804
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,000
Speaker 5:  was in negotiations to do it for private browsing, which Gabriel Weinberg,

805
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,960
Speaker 5:  the c e o said would've been absolutely game changing for their business.

806
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,960
Speaker 5:  It would've increased their mult, their market share. I think he said multiple

807
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,800
Speaker 5:  times over. But like Apple is the moat for Google,

808
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:34,880
Speaker 5:  right? Like Google has Chrome and it has Android and it turns out it's

809
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,840
Speaker 5:  not illegal to like have your own products on your own products. So there's

810
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,560
Speaker 5:  really no fight there. But this one deal

811
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,480
Speaker 5:  that Apple has, if it gave it to somebody else, the DOJs

812
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,720
Speaker 5:  argument is that it would essentially raise up a serious

813
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,160
Speaker 5:  Google competitor out of nothing. And because Google is so rich,

814
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,120
Speaker 5:  it is preventing that from happening. And that's like, that has become the

815
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,320
Speaker 5:  thrust of the argument and it's really fascinating.

816
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,600
Speaker 4:  What do you think?

817
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,440
Speaker 5:  I think it's true. I mean it's, it's hard to say

818
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:07,640
Speaker 5:  counter factually, right? Like one of the things that Judge Meta, who's,

819
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,920
Speaker 5:  who's presiding over this case asked Satya Nadella was could a startup

820
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,960
Speaker 5:  in search succeed? Right? And there's been a bunch of talk about how the

821
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,920
Speaker 5:  search market is considered like a no-fly zone for VCs. They don't even invest

822
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,600
Speaker 5:  in it because it's not worth it. And so we asked him, he was like, can a

823
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,440
Speaker 5:  startup win its search? And Nadella like, thought about it for a second and

824
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,240
Speaker 5:  then just goes, well, there's no evidence for that. And

825
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,880
Speaker 5:  his point over and over was, he was like, we, I, I'm willing to lose

826
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,280
Speaker 5:  $15 billion a year to Apple just to get

827
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,520
Speaker 5:  the query flow and the market share that comes with it for binging. Microsoft

828
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,840
Speaker 5:  at one point thought about selling part or all of binging to Apple

829
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,440
Speaker 5:  in order to fund a competitor that could actually stand up to Google in a

830
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,960
Speaker 5:  real way because they don't think Google being this powerful is valuable.

831
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:54,000
Speaker 5:  Like there are a lot of reasons to believe that

832
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,440
Speaker 5:  what Apple could essentially turn that on for somebody else.

833
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:02,080
Speaker 5:  But also we have no proof. Google has been the partner for 20 years.

834
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,960
Speaker 5:  Like it was in the very first press release announcing Safari,

835
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,400
Speaker 5:  which they showed while Eddie Q was on the stand a couple of weeks ago,

836
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:13,040
Speaker 5:  mentioned Google as a partner and has been a partner ever since. And the

837
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,360
Speaker 5:  terms of that deal have changed. And so we've just never seen it. Like one

838
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,920
Speaker 5:  of the things that has really blown my mind is we've only ever seen one version

839
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,640
Speaker 5:  of the search market. There's never even been in like the modern

840
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,520
Speaker 5:  internet. Another world,

841
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,840
Speaker 4:  Well, there is if you leave this country, right, sure. That's that's also

842
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,200
Speaker 4:  come out right? In other countries, apple partners with other search providers

843
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,680
Speaker 4:  in Safari, and those companies are fine. They like exist

844
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,000
Speaker 4:  in

845
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,920
Speaker 5:  Our competitors. The index is very successful. Yeah. Yeah. And to be clear,

846
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,920
Speaker 6:  Like one of the reasons that if you put something else on Apple

847
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:49,240
Speaker 6:  instead, part of it was, okay, everybody's using it on Apple. So

848
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,920
Speaker 6:  that's just automatically they use it, but it would also learn and get better

849
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,680
Speaker 6:  because more people would be using it. Right? So that's how it would compete.

850
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,400
Speaker 6:  Or is it just like more people using it because it's on Apple and it's the

851
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Speaker 6:  natural, the default search?

852
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So the, the sort of universal truth of searches that the best way to

853
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,600
Speaker 5:  make a search engine is to already have a successful search engine. And

854
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,840
Speaker 5:  the more people use it, like one way to think about it is a big

855
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,720
Speaker 5:  part of your job as a search engine is to know when somebody

856
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,000
Speaker 5:  spells something wrong, what they're actually looking for, right? Like that's

857
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,120
Speaker 5:  a, that's a big job of a search engine. And the way that you do that is by

858
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,840
Speaker 5:  seeing the queries that people get wrong and then where they go

859
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:31,600
Speaker 5:  and you can figure out, okay, well they, they typed this word, they didn't

860
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,000
Speaker 5:  get what they wanted, then they typed that word, which looks very similar.

861
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,680
Speaker 5:  We can put those two things together and the next time somebody searches

862
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:40,320
Speaker 5:  for this wrongly spelled word, we can get it right the first time. You've

863
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,840
Speaker 5:  just instantly made your search engine better, right? Like you just can't

864
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,400
Speaker 5:  do that if you don't have the searches. And everyone

865
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,560
Speaker 5:  acknowledges this. This is not like a secret fact, this is like how the search

866
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,480
Speaker 5:  engine world works, is that the more search queries

867
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,960
Speaker 5:  you get, the better your ranking gets, the better your personalization gets,

868
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,440
Speaker 5:  the better your spell check gets, the better your, they, they call it, there's

869
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,200
Speaker 5:  a better term for it than this, but it's essentially query rewriting. So

870
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,120
Speaker 5:  when you type in a query, what do you actually mean? Are you looking for

871
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,680
Speaker 5:  a shopping link? Are you looking for travel? They, they do this thing where

872
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,520
Speaker 5:  they take the words that you use and then sort of boil it down to a set of

873
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,160
Speaker 5:  words that can also be used in a bunch of different ways. All of that you

874
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,920
Speaker 5:  can only do with the data. And the only way to get that data is to get people

875
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,960
Speaker 5:  searching. And so like what Nadella was saying is he's like, I don't want

876
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,680
Speaker 5:  any of the money that comes out of an Apple deal because

877
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,600
Speaker 5:  I'm so convinced that the product will get so much better that we'll make

878
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,440
Speaker 5:  up the rest of the money elsewhere. And that like, I don't think he's

879
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,240
Speaker 5:  just spouting out of his ass. Like that is the deal that Microsoft

880
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,560
Speaker 5:  has offered to Apple and loss.

881
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,160
Speaker 4:  I will say there's a deeply funny Google presentation that has been

882
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,040
Speaker 4:  entered into the exhibits here about iOS eight.

883
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:48,960
Speaker 5:  Oh, it's so good.

884
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,600
Speaker 4:  I mean, again, this is how long this has been going. Yeah, so an iOS eight

885
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,680
Speaker 4:  Apple World out spotlight, so you could just like pull down and do stuff

886
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,160
Speaker 4:  and there's a deck and we'll link to it and it's in David's piece. It's linked

887
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,120
Speaker 4:  there, but the deck is called, it's a Google deck. It's called iOS

888
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,960
Speaker 4:  eight Revenue Impact. And the first heading on the first

889
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:09,160
Speaker 4:  slide bottom line, it's bad.

890
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,960
Speaker 4:  Like Yep. It's like it's not, they're just like,

891
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,760
Speaker 4:  they're doing less searches. It's bad. And then it goes into it and like,

892
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,040
Speaker 4:  here's all the searches that Apple's doing for itself now and says, instead

893
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,480
Speaker 4:  of sending people to us, it's the app store and maps and Wikipedia and all

894
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,880
Speaker 4:  this stuff. Yeah. And they're just like, yeah, we're just losing searches

895
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,640
Speaker 4:  and revenue because any amount of any amount of loss from

896
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,720
Speaker 4:  Safari is huge. Right? Bottom line. It's bad. It's, but it's like so

897
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:37,720
Speaker 4:  funny. Well,

898
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,560
Speaker 5:  And that has become one of the new stipulations in

899
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,000
Speaker 5:  Google's deal with Apple as of I think 2016, is that Apple

900
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,280
Speaker 5:  can't do more in search than it had been doing in

901
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,080
Speaker 5:  2016. Right? Like by the terms of this agreement, apple is not allowed

902
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,040
Speaker 5:  to build a Google competitor or else it's in violation of this deal.

903
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:01,440
Speaker 4:  This explains by the way, several years ago there was like, IO and

904
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,640
Speaker 4:  WWC were like kind of back to back and at WW d c Apple

905
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,520
Speaker 4:  announced like some more search things in some version of iOS. This

906
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,440
Speaker 4:  is post 2016. And then we went to IO like several days

907
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,280
Speaker 4:  later and all like all the Google people were like apples to and some

908
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,720
Speaker 4:  search stuff.

909
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:23,600
Speaker 4:  And I, and I was at the time, I was like, yeah, they should, but I didn't

910
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,960
Speaker 4:  realize, like, they were like, oh, are they in trouble? Like, are they past

911
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,040
Speaker 4:  the line? And you would, we wouldn't know, right? 'cause this deal was a

912
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,040
Speaker 4:  secret until this trial.

913
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:34,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean we, we, we knew there was a deal, but like the, the

914
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,240
Speaker 5:  machinations of the deal and both how

915
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:42,200
Speaker 5:  profitable it is for Apple and how exclusionary it is

916
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,360
Speaker 5:  are definitely, they're, they're coming out in really new ways. It's really

917
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:46,840
Speaker 5:  interesting

918
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,320
Speaker 4:  Just to say it and we should move on and talk about Sonos. I'm aware that

919
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,080
Speaker 4:  people think that Google should be able to pay whatever money to Apple for

920
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,040
Speaker 4:  whatever Apple wants to buy. And that, yes, I'm aware that many retail

921
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,720
Speaker 4:  stores in America have their own products they put on shelves and they pay

922
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,320
Speaker 4:  for placement. And you can make all kinds of analogies. And I'm just telling

923
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,920
Speaker 4:  you that winning an argument through analogy is like kissing your sister.

924
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,040
Speaker 4:  Like that's just fine. I don't care. You know you didn't do anything. Can

925
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,280
Speaker 4:  I wait?

926
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,200
Speaker 5:  You don't care. Can I just tell you one very quick courtroom story that summarizes

927
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,760
Speaker 5:  this entire thing very well? At one point during Satya NA's testimony,

928
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:20,520
Speaker 5:  judge Meta, who I wouldn't say interrupts a lot, but he'll occasionally like

929
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,840
Speaker 5:  follow up on questions or ask to clarify and like he, he does a lot of sort

930
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,360
Speaker 5:  of drilling down on technical things that either he doesn't understand or

931
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,200
Speaker 5:  he wants in the record or whatever. He at one point looks over at Del and

932
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,120
Speaker 5:  says, okay, imagine you're Tim Cook. Why would you wanna switch to

933
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,720
Speaker 5:  Bing when it's a worst search engine? And that was the whole question. And

934
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,160
Speaker 5:  like you could like Google You know they have a table full of lawyers. Like

935
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,960
Speaker 5:  you could just feel the vibe in the room. Everybody at the Google table is

936
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,520
Speaker 5:  just like, yes.

937
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,320
Speaker 4:  Because that's the whole defense

938
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,520
Speaker 5:  Is that like Satya Nadella getting up there and saying binging is not as

939
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,200
Speaker 5:  good as Google is both a, a case against Google

940
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,920
Speaker 5:  and the entire Google defense, which is that it is not illegal to be the

941
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,600
Speaker 5:  best product and everyone is acknowledging that is the best, it is the best

942
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,560
Speaker 5:  product. It it's just, it's a very funny thing where like D O J

943
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,360
Speaker 5:  has to do this thing where they're saying Google is really good because no

944
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,320
Speaker 5:  one else is allowed to be and Google is just going to keep saying,

945
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:18,360
Speaker 5:  we're good. And that's okay. Yeah. And that's a really, really, really

946
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,320
Speaker 5:  compelling argument. Like being the best is not a

947
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,280
Speaker 5:  problem and Google is going to spend a lot of time when it turns and

948
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,680
Speaker 5:  becomes Google's chance to really give its argument. It's gonna spend a lot

949
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,640
Speaker 5:  of time telling us how terrific Google is. And I'm very much

950
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,040
Speaker 5:  looking forward to like that second half of this trial. Yeah.

951
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,680
Speaker 4:  I think Google is too, to be perfectly honest.

952
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,080
Speaker 5:  Yes.

953
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:43,240
Speaker 4:  Alright. Speaking of Google on a, on a high in the legal

954
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,800
Speaker 4:  system. Yes. I mean this is, this is as

955
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,560
Speaker 4:  when it comes to the patent wars, this is as Slam

956
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,400
Speaker 4:  Donkey swagger off the court as it's gotten a while, Chris, what's going

957
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:54,560
Speaker 4:  on?

958
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,160
Speaker 15:  Sonos got its ass handed into it and in court had a

959
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,040
Speaker 15:  32.5 million judgment tossed out by Judge William Sup

960
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,600
Speaker 15:  one of the most high profile judges who, who's covered, who knows how many

961
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,480
Speaker 15:  tech cases. And

962
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,440
Speaker 4:  We profiled him. Yeah,

963
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,880
Speaker 15:  We profiled him. Profiled him. Yeah. And so he knows his stuff. He knows

964
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,640
Speaker 15:  what Sonos is, how long they've been around. And if you read this Ruling,

965
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,560
Speaker 15:  it's really like a super deep dive on zones and like different rooms

966
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,320
Speaker 15:  and overlapping zones. And so he knows this stuff. And so it comes down

967
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:25,240
Speaker 15:  to, he just said that Sonos took too long to really You know, come up

968
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,920
Speaker 15:  with these complaints and say Google was copying its technology. 13 years

969
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:31,560
Speaker 15:  is really the time between like their first application. And then when they

970
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,320
Speaker 15:  like said You know, hey, Google is stealing our ideas and trying to copy

971
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,760
Speaker 15:  multi-room audio. And so the patents that they

972
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,000
Speaker 15:  had included were rule to be said. They were, they're now invalid

973
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,720
Speaker 15:  and also unenforceable. And so

974
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:48,160
Speaker 5:  In like big bold letters in the Ruling, I very much enjoyed that. It was

975
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,400
Speaker 5:  like a different font for the word unenforceable, which I really liked. So

976
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,080
Speaker 15:  He calls Sonos a pretender and he says Google is the innovator, which is

977
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,920
Speaker 15:  is a little harsh man. Like, ooh, You know. Like Sonos is the company that

978
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,760
Speaker 15:  like has made this their whole brand You know So I feel like that was a

979
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,440
Speaker 15:  little, little mean what did, but what did

980
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,360
Speaker 6:  Google innovate in this space? Yeah.

981
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:08,640
Speaker 15:  I

982
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,200
Speaker 4:  Like, that's a really good question because

983
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,520
Speaker 6:  Honestly this whole case, the entire time we, we've heard about it and,

984
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:17,040
Speaker 6:  and we've been covering it and stuff, it always seemed like Sonos was kind

985
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,560
Speaker 6:  of in the right. Google used

986
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,240
Speaker 4:  Well no. So there this whole,

987
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,280
Speaker 6:  And then that all got thrown out and like yeah,

988
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,920
Speaker 4:  This case has a bunch of twists and turns. The heart of it is

989
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:29,920
Speaker 4:  like not patents. Yeah. And I, this has always been, and

990
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,760
Speaker 4:  we had Patrick Spence and at the time Sonos ISS chief legal counsel on

991
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,920
Speaker 4:  the show and we talked about why you would sue Google and like they're using

992
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,480
Speaker 4:  their patents because they're mad about something else. Yes. Which

993
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:44,840
Speaker 4:  many people have many feelings about. Yeah. Right. What are they mad about?

994
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,960
Speaker 4:  They basically like went to go work with Google and then Google like immediately

995
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,040
Speaker 4:  undercut them on business terms. They released,

996
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,280
Speaker 15:  Put out cheap speakers that cost $49.

997
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,160
Speaker 4:  Right. They like immediately undercut them with cheaper speakers that copied

998
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,760
Speaker 4:  their features. So they did the thing that every big company has always done

999
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,200
Speaker 4:  to small companies forever.

1000
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:02,880
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They pulled an

1001
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,720
Speaker 4:  Amazon, you can, yeah, you can replace Google with Amazon and Sonos is just

1002
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,600
Speaker 4:  as mad, but Amazon lets them use Alexa. Like it's, it's like they're

1003
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:14,560
Speaker 4:  Sonos is in this weird position where they need access to

1004
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:18,320
Speaker 4:  voice assistance or they, at the time they did and they just

1005
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,320
Speaker 4:  ended up really upside down with Google. Yeah. Right. And they thought they,

1006
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,200
Speaker 4:  they felt very strongly that Google taken advantage of them. So then they

1007
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,680
Speaker 4:  said, well look, we invented a bunch of this technology, we've been around

1008
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,600
Speaker 4:  for a long time. We're gonna sue Google for patent infringement that will

1009
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,560
Speaker 4:  create some leverage and Google will inevitably settle because why wouldn't

1010
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,840
Speaker 4:  they? And then we can't get along. And that was like more or less the story.

1011
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:36,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1012
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:37,800
Speaker 15:  Three years later.

1013
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,560
Speaker 4:  And then Google did not settle and Sonos won the judgment and then Google

1014
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,560
Speaker 4:  appealed and now Alsip is like here, what's the quote? It is wrong

1015
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,240
Speaker 4:  that our patent system was used in this way. This is from the Ruling

1016
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,720
Speaker 4:  with its constitutional underpinnings. The system is intended to promote

1017
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,480
Speaker 4:  and protect innovation here. By contrast, it was used to punish an innovator

1018
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:59,720
Speaker 4:  and enrich a pretender by delay in slight of hand. It

1019
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,480
Speaker 4:  has taken a full trial to learn this sad fact, but it long

1020
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:07,480
Speaker 4:  last a measure of justice is done. Like it's, I mean it's

1021
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,920
Speaker 4:  a good, it's a lot. Yeah. You would think that it was a murder trial,

1022
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:11,600
Speaker 4:  right?

1023
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,360
Speaker 6:  Like what did Sonos do to this judge?

1024
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So this judge is like, my fucking speakers keep disappearing. Like

1025
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,720
Speaker 4:  that's what he's,

1026
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,000
Speaker 6:  He had to do that transition from Sonos version one to two,

1027
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,680
Speaker 15:  That S two, he was ready

1028
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:25,240
Speaker 6:  Over

1029
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,680
Speaker 4:  The line. He was super mad at play three. He is just sitting there and he

1030
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,640
Speaker 4:  is like a measure of justice for the Sonos play three,

1031
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,640
Speaker 4:  I don't know man it again for Google it's 30 million. Like Google

1032
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,440
Speaker 4:  sneezes that money, we're just talking about like a $10 billion deal with

1033
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,160
Speaker 4:  Apple. They paying money. But anyway, so now

1034
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,800
Speaker 4:  Google's one, they put out a statement that is just,

1035
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:49,400
Speaker 15:  Yeah, I was taking a victory lap and saying the patent system needs reform

1036
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:52,400
Speaker 15:  and this and that. And Somos came back and said the same thing of course.

1037
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,880
Speaker 15:  But also, also they still wanna keep on fighting Google because they're

1038
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,280
Speaker 15:  trying to like trying to protect their patents and innovations and they're

1039
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,840
Speaker 15:  trying to like get royalties, which I think is the main crux of this whole

1040
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,480
Speaker 15:  thing is like they want all these tech companies to like pay them royalties

1041
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,720
Speaker 15:  for their technology and like multi-room audio and And what whatnot. And

1042
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,360
Speaker 15:  that's clearly not something that Google is, will budge on anytime soon

1043
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,760
Speaker 15:  as we've seen. And so three years later there's no sign of a settlement,

1044
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,560
Speaker 15:  there's no Google Assistant on the new Sono speakers still, which I think

1045
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,400
Speaker 15:  is a worst experience for customers. Yep. Customers always, I, I won't buy

1046
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,160
Speaker 15:  it. Always suffer. Yeah. And yeah, I think, I mean like Sonos was

1047
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,320
Speaker 15:  concerned about these companies putting out cheaper speakers, but I feel

1048
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,960
Speaker 15:  like Google and Amazon really don't care about audio as much anymore. You

1049
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,760
Speaker 15:  know, like the Nest audio came out three years ago and like Google hasn't

1050
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,160
Speaker 15:  put out a new speaker. That was good since

1051
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,080
Speaker 4:  Then. Yeah. I don't even care about their voice assistants anymore. There

1052
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,960
Speaker 4:  was just that new It's Marshall, right. That has both assistant on it at

1053
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,920
Speaker 4:  the same time. I think it

1054
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,440
Speaker 15:  Was jbl, L J B L. Sorry. But yeah, that is both, both things. Which

1055
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:47,400
Speaker 15:  Sonos said once that like they wouldn't couldn't do that by Google's own

1056
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,480
Speaker 15:  terms. They weren't allowed to do that. And so now we see it happening on

1057
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,800
Speaker 15:  this other speaker. So You know, I think it's time to hopefully settle because

1058
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,000
Speaker 15:  I think Sonos has its You know, oh

1059
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,680
Speaker 4:  There's no way. I'm sorry.

1060
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,280
Speaker 15:  Has its own place carved.

1061
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,760
Speaker 4:  If you have a long last, a measure of justice is done in in your back

1062
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,640
Speaker 6:  Pocket. Google's never settling,

1063
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,200
Speaker 4:  There's no settling happening here.

1064
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:07,760
Speaker 15:  Yeah. I just feel like Sonos You know like they're, they're safe. They have

1065
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,360
Speaker 15:  their You know you just walk into like any Best Buy or Target and there's

1066
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,760
Speaker 15:  like a Sonos section there. Like they're not a small company. Well,

1067
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,200
Speaker 4:  Compared to Google. Yeah. Compared

1068
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,880
Speaker 15:  To Google. Yes. But like You know, like small company like David versus

1069
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,880
Speaker 15:  Goliath thing is like You know they're a pretty sizable audio company compared

1070
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,880
Speaker 15:  to like Whim or Weem And what's that brand that Chris person loves a lot?

1071
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,720
Speaker 15:  Like Yeah, that's a small company whim. Sonos Wim. Yeah. Sonos is

1072
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,120
Speaker 15:  a bit larger than that. So I

1073
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,840
Speaker 4:  Will say, Chris and I, earlier this week we went and visited a

1074
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,160
Speaker 4:  studio where Dolby was showing off how they mix in Atmos

1075
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:41,640
Speaker 4:  and their test product was at an era 300. Right?

1076
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,040
Speaker 4:  Right. And it was actually really funny 'cause it was a prototype and it

1077
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,480
Speaker 4:  had the word prototype like printed on it. And I was like, Chris had every

1078
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,800
Speaker 4:  part of this scoop except a picture of a prototype with the word prototype

1079
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:54,560
Speaker 4:  on it. But like, but that's it. Like the, the recording industry is like

1080
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,440
Speaker 4:  in on Sonos, right? Like that is the test product. And Chris was like, do

1081
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,000
Speaker 4:  you ever test on the home pod? And they're like, no, no, no, no, no we don't.

1082
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,480
Speaker 4:  No thank you.

1083
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,240
Speaker 15:  No home pod that.

1084
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,120
Speaker 4:  And it's true. Yeah. I don't think the Amazon products are like huge successes

1085
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,200
Speaker 4:  in the audio world. The Google products certainly aren't. Right. Yeah.

1086
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,240
Speaker 15:  Like yeah, Sonos has like the move to which like none of these brands really

1087
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,920
Speaker 15:  have their own version of So. I feel like Sonos as a business is pretty

1088
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,600
Speaker 15:  secure. So like at least You know, like move towards some kind of resolution

1089
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,240
Speaker 15:  here. Like for the benefit of people and customers who want Google Assistant

1090
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,760
Speaker 15:  on their Sonos speaker and You know. And when

1091
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,640
Speaker 6:  Originally sued Google, it was not as as secure Right

1092
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,200
Speaker 6:  as it is now. Right. Like, like at the time it was very much we are fighting

1093
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:37,040
Speaker 6:  an existential threat from Amazon and from Google and we

1094
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,960
Speaker 6:  do not know how our company is going to continue. And if we don't

1095
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,080
Speaker 6:  figure that out, we're screwed.

1096
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,720
Speaker 4:  So that was a framing. I mean if I Lawsuit. Lawsuit,

1097
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It was our framing.

1098
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,720
Speaker 4:  I believe it was at css. I think we were in Vegas when the lawsuit hit and

1099
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,880
Speaker 4:  it was just before we assumed both companies would announce a bunch of stuff.

1100
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. And they announced a bunch of stuff. You know a theme of this

1101
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,200
Speaker 4:  podcast is that like, Google products don't last a long time. And it's like

1102
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,280
Speaker 4:  looking back we're like, oh were were they gonna stay committed to the Nest

1103
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,880
Speaker 4:  audio or could you have just waited them out? Well I think

1104
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,680
Speaker 6:  What that was a curiosity was like, okay, this is probably almost certainly

1105
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,560
Speaker 6:  not gonna be as good as whatever Sonos does, but it'll cheaper. Is it gonna

1106
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,480
Speaker 6:  be cheaper? And then push Sonos out that way. And so Sonos is

1107
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:20,360
Speaker 6:  shrinks and shrinks and instead Sonos is like, feels like it's kind of turned

1108
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,080
Speaker 6:  it or doing well, right. Apart from this. Well,

1109
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,920
Speaker 4:  I mean I'm curious what Chris's take here, but it seems like they, they didn't

1110
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,000
Speaker 4:  just become a patent troll. They invented a whole bunch of stuff, right?

1111
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,680
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Right. And Patrick Spence has been on the show a bunch of time being

1112
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,080
Speaker 4:  like, the pace of innovation, we need to pick it up. We need to go faster.

1113
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,880
Speaker 4:  They're on a yearly cadence now. Yeah. Before Patrick showed up, they were

1114
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,280
Speaker 4:  on like a one decade cadence. Yes. You know, like,

1115
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,720
Speaker 4:  so like I think they did the right thing there for sure.

1116
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,520
Speaker 4:  I I this rule you should read the rule. It's like a fun read. Yeah.

1117
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:52,320
Speaker 4:  To read this Ruling. 'cause it, he's just so mad, he's sad,

1118
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,360
Speaker 15:  So angry that any

1119
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:57,080
Speaker 4:  Of this happened. I I think there's like an

1120
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:01,000
Speaker 4:  equal amount of mad at Google that you could be because they

1121
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,480
Speaker 4:  didn't like 70, 80% of cases settle

1122
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:08,720
Speaker 4:  and if your Google it is probably better to

1123
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,560
Speaker 4:  settle and move on and also have Google Assistant be available on all

1124
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,360
Speaker 4:  kinds of devices for what is peanuts in the scheme of Google.

1125
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:20,510
Speaker 4:  Right. But it's a fun distribu and like a measure

1126
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,030
Speaker 4:  of justice is done. It's, it's incredible for a, for a

1127
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:26,790
Speaker 4:  a multi-zone audio patent lawsuit.

1128
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,110
Speaker 4:  What's going on over there? Bill? You All right?

1129
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,470
Speaker 4:  Still still pissed about the, the play three like air, three hundred's

1130
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:38,430
Speaker 4:  out. It's a replacement.

1131
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:39,950
Speaker 6:  Seems real nice.

1132
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,950
Speaker 4:  It's, it sounds great. Chris loves it.

1133
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:45,030
Speaker 15:  I do. I do like most of their products. You know Google and Amazon, their

1134
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,910
Speaker 15:  speakers are fine. Like the Echo Studio is fine. It's been sitting there

1135
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:50,470
Speaker 15:  like untouched for like three or four years now. So. But it sounds nice.

1136
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:54,550
Speaker 15:  I just think tho those companies clearly don't care about audio as much

1137
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:57,190
Speaker 15:  as they once to I think Apple, like if there's one company that someone

1138
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:01,150
Speaker 15:  should be like pretty concerned about, it's Apple HomePod and like AirPods

1139
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:03,750
Speaker 15:  You know like headphones if they ever get into headphones, obviously that's

1140
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:07,630
Speaker 15:  gonna be a hard climb for Sonos to do And I think there will be like a

1141
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:10,830
Speaker 15:  You know some kinda Apple soundbar at some point. It seems like they're

1142
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:11,830
Speaker 15:  super interested in the computer. Do

1143
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:13,190
Speaker 4:  You think Apple's gonna make a soundbar? Yeah. Oh

1144
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:15,550
Speaker 6:  Yeah. With the home pods as as satellites, right?

1145
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,390
Speaker 15:  Yeah, yeah. Something like that. Yeah. I think they're gonna

1146
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,110
Speaker 4:  No way

1147
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:19,590
Speaker 15:  Come into their territory at point

1148
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:20,150
Speaker 4:  A bit. Way more.

1149
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,910
Speaker 6:  No way. It's gonna be like the KU one. It's gonna have an Apple TV

1150
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:25,470
Speaker 4:  Building unless can figure out how to sell you extra iCloud storage the product.

1151
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:26,830
Speaker 4:  They will never make it. Well I go

1152
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:30,150
Speaker 15:  With the trouble of like letting you use two home pods as like E Arc outputs

1153
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:32,630
Speaker 15:  if they're not gonna like make a proper soundbar at some point

1154
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:36,670
Speaker 4:  They did that. Like they did that under duress. They're like

1155
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:40,310
Speaker 4:  God damnit You know like straight up like enough people just

1156
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:43,790
Speaker 4:  annoyed them about this thing. Yeah. And then like probably Phil Schiller

1157
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:47,390
Speaker 4:  and his house was like, why do I have other speakers? You know. Yeah.

1158
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:51,750
Speaker 4:  But actually a soundbar no way. 0% chance. I don't know.

1159
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,910
Speaker 4:  They are not interested in that market Percent.

1160
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,870
Speaker 15:  We can have a wager, we can have a wager,

1161
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:00,110
Speaker 4:  A wager. Apple will release a cheap Vision pro before they release

1162
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:00,750
Speaker 4:  a soundbar.

1163
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,030
Speaker 15:  Okay. Wow. You're

1164
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:02,830
Speaker 6:  Gonna make some money Chris.

1165
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:04,070
Speaker 15:  I'm pretty proud.

1166
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:05,150
Speaker 6:  I'm really excited for you.

1167
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:05,830
Speaker 15:  Yeah, me too.

1168
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:09,630
Speaker 4:  All, right? This is, this is an important prediction on it. You think they're

1169
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:10,550
Speaker 4:  gonna make a soundbar?

1170
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:13,350
Speaker 15:  I mean what's a cheap vision pro? We should really get into that. A

1171
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:14,910
Speaker 4:  Thousand dollars, a thousand dollars dollars.

1172
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:15,790
Speaker 6:  Ooh

1173
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:19,160
Speaker 4:  That's cheap. I think that's, I think for a product of Vision Pro that's,

1174
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,120
Speaker 4:  it's, I think you still have good odds significantly now

1175
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,120
Speaker 15:  I think I'm, yeah I think I'm still feeling pretty good about some kind

1176
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,400
Speaker 15:  of like Apple tv, four K, soundbar, HomePod, concoction, You know one of

1177
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,320
Speaker 15:  those things all melted.

1178
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:32,080
Speaker 4:  When I think of Apple, I think of Concoctions. It's

1179
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:37,360
Speaker 5:  Feel, we'll see an important stipulation is you only win if Apple calls

1180
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,080
Speaker 5:  it a soundbar, which is never ever, ever, ever, ever

1181
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:41,400
Speaker 5:  will

1182
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,320
Speaker 4:  Not single, what would it call it?

1183
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,280
Speaker 5:  Not a single chance. Who knows? There's

1184
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,240
Speaker 4:  A 0% chance Apple. I just wanna be so

1185
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,360
Speaker 5:  Clear about this. Yeah, I'm with Neli on this. Like that's, it's never gonna

1186
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,680
Speaker 5:  happen. I don't know, one thing I've been thinking about a lot with this

1187
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,920
Speaker 5:  is it seems like one of the things that happened from when this

1188
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:02,120
Speaker 5:  Ruling star or from when this trial started to today is that the

1189
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:05,920
Speaker 5:  stakes for audio seem like they've gone way down. Like if you

1190
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,520
Speaker 5:  rewind a bunch of years to when this all started, we were in this phase where

1191
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,080
Speaker 5:  like voice assistance were gonna be the next big thing. Everybody was gonna

1192
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,840
Speaker 5:  use them, they were gonna be huge businesses. Sonos was under pressure to

1193
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,400
Speaker 5:  like be part of this because the idea was you were gonna have speakers all

1194
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,200
Speaker 5:  over your house and you were gonna talk to them and that was your gonna be

1195
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,400
Speaker 5:  your main interface with technology. And like that idea is

1196
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,960
Speaker 5:  not dead but like not alive anymore. And so

1197
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:31,800
Speaker 5:  now we're back to this speaker business and Google and Amazon have no

1198
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,600
Speaker 5:  interest in being in the speaker business. They're in the, they're in the

1199
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,480
Speaker 5:  business of getting you to use their assistance but they're even getting

1200
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:42,440
Speaker 5:  out of those businesses. Like Amazon is shedding the Alexa team in a big

1201
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,280
Speaker 5:  way. Google is gonna put borrowed into assistant but is already like pretty

1202
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:50,240
Speaker 5:  clearly pivoting the way that it thinks about that as a tool. Like

1203
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,440
Speaker 5:  we're just out of this phase where speakers are going to be the centerpiece

1204
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,320
Speaker 5:  of your home and they're back to being speakers. And I think if we're gonna

1205
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:01,160
Speaker 5:  go back to being speakers, that's probably good news for Sonos, right? Because

1206
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,920
Speaker 5:  these other companies just aren't gonna care that much about it.

1207
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,000
Speaker 15:  Yeah. Right. So then it's like why keep fighting this battle? You know,

1208
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,680
Speaker 15:  like just You know.

1209
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,160
Speaker 5:  I think at some point if you're Google you're like, we, we can't go down

1210
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,720
Speaker 5:  this road because then we're gonna end up paying royalties on everything

1211
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:18,400
Speaker 5:  every time we screw over a small tech company and we're hosed. Like the

1212
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:22,040
Speaker 5:  fight for them seems like it's on like patent principle rather than

1213
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,040
Speaker 5:  the specifics of this case. Right? Whereas Sonos like needed

1214
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:30,280
Speaker 5:  this win a lot more back then. But at this point, I

1215
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,920
Speaker 5:  don't know, like I don't know how big Sonos loses here.

1216
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:37,040
Speaker 6:  Sonos has gotta fight 'cause they got owned so hard

1217
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,840
Speaker 6:  in this judgment like

1218
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,080
Speaker 5:  Oh sure they did. Yeah, for sure.

1219
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,600
Speaker 6:  If I got owned that hard I would fight. Even if I knew I was gonna lose,

1220
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,560
Speaker 6:  I'd be like, no, I'm still going.

1221
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:49,480
Speaker 4:  Well to be clear, so they lost it. This court. Okay, they need to appeal

1222
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,560
Speaker 4:  to an appeals court, right? Yeah.

1223
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:55,000
Speaker 15:  And so there's this case and there's still several others. There's one at

1224
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,760
Speaker 15:  the I T C where they've won a few times to ban like very old

1225
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,440
Speaker 15:  Google products that you can't even buy anymore. As is usually the case

1226
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,040
Speaker 15:  with those lawsuits, Neil. And so yeah, there's other counter

1227
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:08,600
Speaker 15:  suits from Google and several countries. So it's still just like a very

1228
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:12,920
Speaker 15:  like very angry feud that seems to have no sign of

1229
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,080
Speaker 15:  cooling down anytime soon. Which seems a bit silly at this point.

1230
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:20,400
Speaker 4:  Well now that a measure of justice has been done, I don't know why you don't

1231
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,360
Speaker 4:  say that All. There's a long road you can, there's an appeals court. I love

1232
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:27,720
Speaker 4:  the idea of our current Supreme court being made to cons deeply consider

1233
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,280
Speaker 4:  multi-room audio. That's

1234
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,040
Speaker 6:  All I want. David just sitting in the,

1235
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,920
Speaker 4:  Oh my god. A pile of soundbars has arrived at Justice Clarence Thomas' house

1236
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,920
Speaker 4:  and he didn't refuse them. Oh no,

1237
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:46,120
Speaker 4:  I can't help it if my friends own a jet and love surround

1238
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:49,120
Speaker 4:  sound. All. right. We gotta take a break. We'll do a lightning round and

1239
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,400
Speaker 4:  then we'll get outta here. We'll be right back.

1240
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:45,770
Speaker 4:  All. right, we're back. Lightning around time. Alex, you wanna start? Yeah,

1241
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,970
Speaker 6:  There's a new piece.

1242
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:49,130
Speaker 4:  Oh by the way, a number of people have told us that we need to change the

1243
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:51,370
Speaker 4:  lightning around to U S P C round 'cause You know

1244
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,730
Speaker 6:  It's not as pow sounding. It's

1245
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:57,810
Speaker 4:  It also, it's not named after the port.

1246
01:09:58,730 --> 01:09:59,770
Speaker 4:  I don't know how to, it's

1247
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:00,250
Speaker 6:  Just a lightning

1248
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,810
Speaker 4:  Round. We have multiple that's just a noun. This is

1249
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,690
Speaker 5:  The P C I round. Get ready everybody.

1250
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,370
Speaker 4:  It's the Thunderbolt four round. Okay, go ahead. Alex

1251
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,850
Speaker 6:  Sponsored by Intel. Oh my gosh. Oh sorry.

1252
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:12,850
Speaker 4:  You gotta pay us money for that.

1253
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:14,810
Speaker 6:  Me or Intel someone. Someone

1254
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:17,730
Speaker 4:  If you wanna pay us to sponsor the Thunderbolt fore round,

1255
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:23,050
Speaker 4:  I'm not gonna say no All. right, go ahead. There's some journalistic integrity

1256
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:26,890
Speaker 4:  there. I'm, there's transparent disclosure. I will accept money if

1257
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:27,250
Speaker 4:  it's funny.

1258
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:33,690
Speaker 6:  All, right, so the Sony PS five, it's got a new Sony PS five.

1259
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,930
Speaker 6:  Yeah, just like now. Now you can go buy one and that is a perfect time to

1260
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:41,290
Speaker 6:  be like, no, we got new ones coming. It's been rumored for a while. It's

1261
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:45,090
Speaker 6:  smaller, it's slimmer. It should actually fit in most home

1262
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:48,010
Speaker 6:  theater setups, which the current one doesn't.

1263
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,290
Speaker 5:  Okay, I I would like to quibble with that particular assessment. Yeah. This

1264
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:52,770
Speaker 5:  thing is Jake, you

1265
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:55,170
Speaker 6:  Probably have an ugly home theater setup. This thing

1266
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:59,130
Speaker 5:  Went from being preposterously humongous to very

1267
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:01,410
Speaker 5:  slightly less preposterously. Humongous.

1268
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,210
Speaker 15:  Yeah. I think there's a piece on the side actually by JP Peters that says

1269
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:08,370
Speaker 15:  the Slim PS five is still huge. So it's, it's a

1270
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:08,570
Speaker 15:  chunk,

1271
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,770
Speaker 5:  It's it's smoother now it's much more like straightforward i f R on Lord

1272
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,720
Speaker 5:  of the The Rings now than it was. Yeah,

1273
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:18,680
Speaker 6:  No, no, but it's 24% lighter, which I think is very

1274
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,640
Speaker 6:  important. People, my

1275
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:21,920
Speaker 5:  Home Peter system will be psyched about that. Yeah.

1276
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:26,160
Speaker 4:  This is the thing that you put down once and never, never touch again. Right.

1277
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:30,400
Speaker 6:  I'm just, look, these are the specs they gave us and this is what they're

1278
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:30,600
Speaker 6:  proud.

1279
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:33,880
Speaker 4:  Have you seen, have you seen the stand for horizontal mode? I didn't know

1280
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,280
Speaker 6:  You're supposed to use the current one with the stand and

1281
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,800
Speaker 4:  So you just had your current one horizontal the whole time. Yeah. Oh

1282
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,280
Speaker 6:  Boy. To fit in my home theater system, I had to clear a whole

1283
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,800
Speaker 4:  Shelf. I'll say that Sony picked and then picked another shape that

1284
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,520
Speaker 4:  incompatible with most furniture. Yeah. Yes. They're just like, oh this is

1285
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,050
Speaker 4:  for a rectangle to hell with you.

1286
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:58,370
Speaker 4:  But the little stand to be horizontal is not a stand. It's just like a little

1287
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,290
Speaker 4:  peg. It's like a little peg leg.

1288
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:04,610
Speaker 6:  I know. I just like stuck in like a something under there. There's the

1289
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:07,450
Speaker 15:  Stand you can detach the optical drive, which is truly wild. That's

1290
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:10,250
Speaker 6:  Wild. Yeah. Yeah. The the optical drive I think is most interesting. Yeah,

1291
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,810
Speaker 6:  this is the part like Tom Warren, when he was looking at the news, he was

1292
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:16,690
Speaker 6:  like, oh my God, that's so cool. And like yeah, it

1293
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,370
Speaker 6:  is cool. It, it, it looks, it's, it seems fairly elegant way to,

1294
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,810
Speaker 6:  to do it. 'cause you can now go same price,

1295
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:26,770
Speaker 6:  24% lighter, 30%

1296
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,170
Speaker 6:  smaller by volume.

1297
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:32,450
Speaker 4:  Hey, that's, those are how people consider game consoles. Yeah.

1298
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,810
Speaker 4:  Xbox or PS five. I'm going with 30% smaller by volume.

1299
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,650
Speaker 6:  That's what you should have listed on like the the Costco website. Yeah.

1300
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:40,330
Speaker 6:  The Best Buy website.

1301
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:43,170
Speaker 5:  My water displacement is gonna go so far down when I read it.

1302
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,610
Speaker 15:  Still feel like physical media is like slowly dying here. Like this is like

1303
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:49,770
Speaker 15:  an optional like optical drive. You can have it if you want it, if you wanna

1304
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:52,890
Speaker 15:  watch four K of Blu-ray, like that new Xbox that leaked has like has no

1305
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:56,690
Speaker 15:  more drive in there anymore. So, I feel like we're slowly inching towards

1306
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:58,330
Speaker 15:  like a gaming world where it's like all digital.

1307
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,610
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're getting rid of the, the, the drives. But the drives

1308
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:06,010
Speaker 6:  are actually important. They're good. If you wanna watch

1309
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:10,290
Speaker 6:  DVDs and, and U h d Blu-rays and everything, like only three

1310
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:13,610
Speaker 6:  people in the world and they're all in this room. Yeah, would do. But

1311
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,930
Speaker 6:  it's a little cheaper, right? Like it's four 50 starting for the digital,

1312
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:21,050
Speaker 6:  the the disc free one and previously it was 4 99 for, for the

1313
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:24,690
Speaker 6:  digital free one and then the, the new base like

1314
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:29,010
Speaker 6:  model with the drive already installed is gonna be 4 99, which

1315
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:32,890
Speaker 6:  was the old price for the disc free one. So that's kind of nice. And

1316
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:36,330
Speaker 6:  then there's gonna be the display which is 80 bucks additional and

1317
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:39,250
Speaker 6:  integrates kind of neatly. You can go look at it on the website. It's, it's

1318
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:42,370
Speaker 6:  cool, there's like a little video. It shows the integration and it is cool.

1319
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,290
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But like you should also go look at Jay's story about how much

1320
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:50,010
Speaker 6:  smaller it is because like 30% volume does not actually track

1321
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:52,090
Speaker 6:  to dimensions. Yeah.

1322
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:55,850
Speaker 15:  You still don't wanna measure your cabinet and make sure it'll, it'll fit

1323
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:55,970
Speaker 15:  in

1324
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:59,850
Speaker 4:  It again. It is also a shape that is incompatible with most things. You can't

1325
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:03,330
Speaker 6:  Stack on it then you just slide off. It's horrible.

1326
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:06,010
Speaker 4:  I think that yeah, yeah. All right Chris what you got

1327
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:10,090
Speaker 15:  My pick of the week is the speakers on the Pixel eight Pro.

1328
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,920
Speaker 15:  If you've owned a Pixel over the last few years, you've known that Google

1329
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:16,760
Speaker 15:  for some reason has put like terrible out speakers in their phones. This

1330
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,880
Speaker 15:  started with the Pixel five. They had some weird like vibration motor that

1331
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,360
Speaker 15:  like made sound and then they went back to like standard speakers for the

1332
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,440
Speaker 15:  Pixel six and Pixel seven. But they were tinny and hollow and just sounded

1333
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:30,280
Speaker 15:  like absolute trash. And so since the Pixel eight

1334
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,240
Speaker 15:  pro now costs a thousand dollars, you would hope and pray that the speaker

1335
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,080
Speaker 15:  is decent. Like I don't use my speaker a ton, but if I'm in bed and You

1336
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,960
Speaker 15:  know playing a podcast or watching a video, I want it to sound decent. I

1337
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,000
Speaker 15:  don't wanna spend a grand on a phone and have it sound like absolute garbage.

1338
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,560
Speaker 15:  And so finally Google, I'm happy to say has a speaker that sounds

1339
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:50,760
Speaker 15:  comparable to the iPhone. Not quite. Okay. The level of the iPhone 15 Pro

1340
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,480
Speaker 15:  Max but You know it's in that ballpark, which was certainly not the case

1341
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:57,480
Speaker 15:  last year. Yeah. Or the year before that. Or the year before that.

1342
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:01,640
Speaker 5:  My wife has a Pixel six and I mean just by virtue

1343
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:05,600
Speaker 5:  of like what I do for a living, I have 400,000 speakers in this

1344
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,440
Speaker 5:  house. She steadfastly refuses to use any of them and

1345
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,280
Speaker 5:  just plays everything out of her phone. And the rage it has filled me with

1346
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:17,080
Speaker 5:  in the last two years as she has had this phone of how bad it sounds all

1347
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,480
Speaker 5:  the time. She's just like, oh we're gonna like put on some music while we

1348
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,200
Speaker 5:  have dinner. And I'm like, there's a Sonos like you're connected to this

1349
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:26,240
Speaker 5:  Sonos. And she's like, no, I'll just, I'll just put it on my phone. It'll

1350
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:26,360
Speaker 5:  be fine.

1351
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:29,720
Speaker 4:  This is podcast through Becky's phone. Yes. I'm like, Hey what kind of speaker

1352
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,600
Speaker 4:  should I get? Should I put speakers in the ceiling in your house? She's like,

1353
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,760
Speaker 4:  I don't know. I listen to podcasts in my phone. I'm like, but there's

1354
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,640
Speaker 4:  a world of possibilities exist for you. No, no podcast in my phone.

1355
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:40,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1356
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:44,160
Speaker 5:  So like to me the speaker upgrade might be the single most important thing

1357
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,320
Speaker 5:  about the Pixel eight. And I will probably be buying Anna one as a result.

1358
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:48,480
Speaker 5:  It's very exciting for me.

1359
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:51,320
Speaker 15:  It's a good phone and it doesn't get that hot anymore. Which was pretty

1360
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,120
Speaker 15:  concerning about the past.

1361
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:55,920
Speaker 4:  That's a real part of this generation of phones is boy they get real hot

1362
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,880
Speaker 4:  when you first buy 'em.

1363
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:02,000
Speaker 15:  Gotta be careful that Instagram, it's a heavy resource intensive app. All.

1364
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,040
Speaker 15:  right.

1365
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,080
Speaker 4:  I'll make mine quick. There's another trial that's happening right now. Sam

1366
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,480
Speaker 4:  Bankman Free is on trial for the F T X. We'll just call it fraud. I mean

1367
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,360
Speaker 4:  I think it's like fairly obvious what happened here. And Liz Lipato

1368
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:16,200
Speaker 4:  is here in New York. She's been at the courthouse filing reports every day.

1369
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:20,080
Speaker 4:  It is some of the funniest coverage we've ever had on the site. It is Liz

1370
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:24,680
Speaker 4:  at Full Force in terms of being a writer. Some just the funniest

1371
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,600
Speaker 4:  writing we've had on the site. Her last headline is Sim Bankman. Fried

1372
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,240
Speaker 4:  was a terrible boyfriend. I mean perfect. Just like perfect. Just go read

1373
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:35,640
Speaker 4:  it, go read it. All it. She's doing it basically every day. There's like

1374
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,640
Speaker 4:  an army of people waiting, just like waiting for her edits at the end of

1375
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,800
Speaker 4:  like the courtroom day. It's all very funny and the dude did

1376
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,560
Speaker 4:  it. I don't like, I don't want to turn this into too much of a true crime

1377
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,280
Speaker 4:  podcast, but after extensive investigation I can

1378
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:53,960
Speaker 4:  exclusively reveal that F T X was a scam

1379
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,520
Speaker 4:  and it was obvious the entire time in crypto was a fraud. Just Michael Lewis

1380
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,200
Speaker 5:  Is gonna find you and fight you.

1381
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:02,760
Speaker 4:  That dude we do have another hour.

1382
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:08,000
Speaker 4:  Did he see the thing Michael Lewis, he wrote the blindside that book, which

1383
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,960
Speaker 4:  is now in a substantial amount of controversy. But he had a state, I think

1384
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,480
Speaker 4:  he gave an interview time this week. He's like, I wrote my book for the jury.

1385
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:18,080
Speaker 4:  They should read my book. And it's like, no, they should do the trial.

1386
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,880
Speaker 4:  I think that might be a substantially better use of their time. They should

1387
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,840
Speaker 4:  watch Money Ball Base

1388
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,120
Speaker 15:  There.

1389
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:29,400
Speaker 4:  Such that. Pretty good. Okay. Read Liz's coverage. It's great.

1390
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:31,760
Speaker 4:  It's really fun. All right? That was mine. David, what's yours?

1391
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:36,240
Speaker 5:  I would just like to very quickly appeal to Samsung and Google to

1392
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:40,160
Speaker 5:  stop being so embarrassing trying to convince Apple to support

1393
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:40,520
Speaker 5:  RCS.

1394
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:45,160
Speaker 4:  Oh no. Do we have to disclose that Dieter Bone, former host of The

1395
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:49,320
Speaker 4:  Vergecast regularly tweets at Apple about

1396
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,400
Speaker 4:  RCS. Sure.

1397
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,200
Speaker 5:  There you go. Done. Disclosed Dieter is right to be clear, Google is

1398
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:58,040
Speaker 5:  right. Samsung is right. Apple should support RCS. It is a, it is

1399
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,280
Speaker 5:  a better system. S m s is like a technological disaster that should no longer

1400
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:04,800
Speaker 5:  exist and we should stop using it. Silly YouTube videos

1401
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:09,400
Speaker 5:  from major competitors are not going to

1402
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,440
Speaker 5:  convince Apple to do anything. In fact, I would argue

1403
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:17,000
Speaker 5:  that every time Samsung and Google say to Apple,

1404
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,960
Speaker 5:  do RCS or you won't be cool anymore, Tim Cook just like,

1405
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,200
Speaker 5:  I don't

1406
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,520
Speaker 4:  Know, buy your mom an iPhone

1407
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:26,680
Speaker 5:  Throws the cat out the window and like Cackles, I don't know, whatever he

1408
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,360
Speaker 5:  does throws

1409
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,120
Speaker 4:  A cat out the window. I dunno. He's like, bring me another cat.

1410
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:35,360
Speaker 4:  Samsung's at it again. Open the cat room.

1411
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:37,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1412
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:41,240
Speaker 5:  And like, and now Samsung's whole thing is like, we're bubbles

1413
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:44,960
Speaker 5:  too and it's just like, it's not gonna work. Yeah. Go

1414
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,520
Speaker 5:  go pick the a fight with carriers. Go try to like

1415
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:52,440
Speaker 5:  covertly destroy s m s from the outside. Like pick,

1416
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:56,480
Speaker 5:  pick any fight you want or just like wait for the EU to make Apple You know

1417
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,760
Speaker 5:  interoperate with all of the other messaging apps and it'll be fine. But

1418
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,080
Speaker 5:  like, it

1419
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,880
Speaker 15:  Just seems kind of sad. It's like all the teens are leaving our phones.

1420
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,920
Speaker 15:  We have to like come up with these ad campaigns to put

1421
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,440
Speaker 5:  Up a fight. Like I want this to happen and they're doing it wrong

1422
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,200
Speaker 5:  and I would like them to stop.

1423
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:15,120
Speaker 4:  It's real cringe. Here's, here's what Google can do. Have a messaging app

1424
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:15,880
Speaker 4:  that people like to use.

1425
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:18,440
Speaker 6:  Stick with it for longer

1426
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:22,520
Speaker 4:  Than you should call it Gchat, an app. Which people

1427
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:26,600
Speaker 4:  firmly believed that they used and loved but which Google never made.

1428
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,240
Speaker 15:  I don't mean I think Alo was the way that was the,

1429
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:30,560
Speaker 4:  My God,

1430
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:31,760
Speaker 6:  It's all about do
