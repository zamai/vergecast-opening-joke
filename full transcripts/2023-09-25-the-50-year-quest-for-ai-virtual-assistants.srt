Speaker 2:  Support for this show comes from a w s. Innovations in

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,100
Speaker 2:  machine learning and AI have completely changed the game. But

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,900
Speaker 2:  as with any cutting edge technology, it's important to stay ahead of the

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,780
Speaker 2:  curve or you risk getting left behind. Amazon Web Services

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,860
Speaker 2:  can help your small business stay ahead of the competition. A W

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,780
Speaker 2:  SS provides a framework for businesses to navigate the fast changing landscape

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,900
Speaker 2:  and helps businesses harness the emerging capabilities of AI and

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,500
Speaker 2:  machine learning. It's time to imagine how a w S can

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,620
Speaker 2:  transform your business. Go to a SS is how.com

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,900
Speaker 3:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of generative search queries.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,020
Speaker 3:  I'm your friend David Pierce and this is the third and final episode in our

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,980
Speaker 3:  series about ai. And for this one I wanna talk about one of the oldest stories

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,180
Speaker 3:  in AI and really one of the oldest stories in the tech industry as a whole,

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,460
Speaker 3:  the virtual digital assistant. My favorite story about this

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,100
Speaker 3:  is one I learned a few years ago and I've been thinking about it ever since.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,420
Speaker 3:  So go back to 1979 in Palo Alto, California, this

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,260
Speaker 3:  guy named Steve Jobs, you may have heard of him, goes to Xerox Park, which

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,740
Speaker 3:  was this ultra successful r and d lab owned at the time by

21
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,940
Speaker 3:  Xerox. People at Park helped create everything from laser printers

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,580
Speaker 3:  to ethernet to personal computers. It was this incredible factory

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,700
Speaker 3:  of cool technology. But the thing park is probably best known

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,460
Speaker 3:  for is what Steve Jobs saw. The graphical user interface

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,140
Speaker 3:  which went beyond the text-based command based computers

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,740
Speaker 3:  everybody was using and actually used images, menus and

27
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,020
Speaker 3:  space like three dimensional space to help people navigate their computers.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,420
Speaker 3:  And as the legend goes, jobs saw all that, took it back to Apple, made

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,140
Speaker 3:  the Macintosh, took over the world. The story's actually slightly

30
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,140
Speaker 3:  more complicated than that. The Macintosh had been in development since about

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,860
Speaker 3:  a year earlier and it seems like what the park visit may have really done

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,860
Speaker 3:  is help convince jobs that it was a good idea worth pursuing and building

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,260
Speaker 3:  rather than, you know, showing it to him for the first time. But that is

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,900
Speaker 3:  not what I wanna talk about. The story I wanna talk about was happening in

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,740
Speaker 3:  a different lab at park where a bunch of employees were teaching a computer

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,940
Speaker 3:  to understand and communicate in natural language.

37
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,340
Speaker 3:  They had this idea for what they called the conversational user interface

38
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,580
Speaker 3:  where instead of typing commands, essentially like writing code into your

39
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,180
Speaker 3:  computer, you could work with your computer by just asking questions and

40
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,980
Speaker 3:  typing like a person. Remember this all sounds very normal now, this is

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,780
Speaker 3:  almost 50 years ago. And actually forget typing as a whole. They thought

42
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,340
Speaker 3:  maybe eventually you'd just talk to your computer out loud like a person.

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,500
Speaker 3:  The team at Park in general thought that a computer should act more like

44
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,540
Speaker 3:  an assistant than a machine. You'd say book me a flight to Tucson for

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,420
Speaker 3:  next weekend and it wouldn't launch a program to do that, it would just do

46
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,120
Speaker 3:  it for you. They actually built this thing called Gus the genial

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,960
Speaker 3:  Understander system to show off what they were talking about. And in a

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,600
Speaker 3:  paper in 1977, again 46 years ago,

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,280
Speaker 3:  the researchers included a sample dialogue of how this interface might work.

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,600
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna have two AI voices read it right now just so you get the vibe of

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,520
Speaker 3:  how it might work. It starts with Guss, the AI system introducing itself.

52
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,720
Speaker 5:  Hello, my name is Gus. I can help you plan a simple trip by air.

53
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,800
Speaker 5:  Where do you want to go?

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,960
Speaker 4:  I want to go to San Diego on May 28th.

55
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,720
Speaker 5:  What time do you want to leave?

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,200
Speaker 4:  I must be in San Diego before 10 in the morning.

57
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,400
Speaker 5:  What do you like? P S A flight 102 that arrives at

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,360
Speaker 5:  9:15 AM

59
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,080
Speaker 4:  What is the next flight?

60
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,280
Speaker 5:  Air California flight 310 that leaves at 8:30 AM

61
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,880
Speaker 5:  and arrives at 10:00 AM

62
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,680
Speaker 4:  I'll take the first one.

63
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,760
Speaker 5:  In what name should I make a reservation, please?

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,320
Speaker 4:  Dan Bobrow.

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,920
Speaker 5:  I have confirmed the following flight P ss a flight 102

66
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,560
Speaker 5:  on Wednesday, May 28th from San Jose to San Diego. That leaves at

67
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,440
Speaker 5:  7:30 AM and arrives at 9:15 AM What date

68
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,560
Speaker 5:  do you want to return on

69
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,080
Speaker 4:  On Friday in the evening? Would

70
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,040
Speaker 5:  You like the flight that leaves at 7:45 PM

71
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,320
Speaker 4:  That's fine.

72
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,080
Speaker 5:  I have confirmed the following flight P S A flight 307

73
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,720
Speaker 5:  on Friday, May 30th from San Diego to San Jose that leaves at

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,520
Speaker 5:  7:45 PM and arrives at 9:30 PM Thank you

75
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680
Speaker 5:  for calling. Goodbye.

76
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,440
Speaker 3:  I'm pretty sure the voices there wouldn't have sounded nearly that good in

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,560
Speaker 3:  1977, but you get the idea. Obviously the graphical

78
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,960
Speaker 3:  user interface won out at the time and won for a long time.

79
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,680
Speaker 3:  That thing you just heard is not how we book plane tickets and it hasn't

80
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,040
Speaker 3:  been for the last four decades, but people did keep working on this stuff.

81
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,600
Speaker 3:  The idea of a virtual digital assistant that can just do things for

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Speaker 3:  you and all you have to do is talk to it like you would talk to a person,

83
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,720
Speaker 3:  has been so seductive to so many people for so long. And

84
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,640
Speaker 3:  in recent years it actually feels like we're kind of veering back toward

85
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,440
Speaker 3:  the conversational user interface as the future of computing. I mean

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,000
Speaker 3:  chat G P T is nothing if not a conversational user interface.

87
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,960
Speaker 3:  It's like the whole of the internet in a chat window binging is becoming

88
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,840
Speaker 3:  the same thing Google has barred, which is you know, the same deal. And

89
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,760
Speaker 3:  even with things like Alexa and Siri and Google Assistant, we've been heading

90
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,480
Speaker 3:  down this road for almost a decade, but it actually feels like it's

91
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,440
Speaker 3:  really exploding right now. And this push we're

92
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,320
Speaker 3:  on raises some really interesting questions. How far does the chat window

93
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,360
Speaker 3:  go? Is the future of computing really just like messaging

94
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,720
Speaker 3:  And are we actually with this advent of modern large language

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,520
Speaker 3:  models and all of the underlying tech that makes AI smarter and more

96
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,440
Speaker 3:  useful? Getting close to the kind of virtual assistant we've been dreaming

97
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,320
Speaker 3:  about for basically half a century To help me figure out

98
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,360
Speaker 3:  those answers, I called up Richard Soer.

99
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,320
Speaker 6:  I'm Richard Soer and I'm the c e o@u.com.

100
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,880
Speaker 3:  U.com is actually one of the most ambitious AI assistant

101
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
Speaker 3:  platforms I've ever tried. It's partly an AI search engine so it can

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,760
Speaker 3:  answer your questions or help you find information on the web. That's really

103
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,680
Speaker 3:  where it started. It's also a generative AI tool so you can

104
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Speaker 3:  use it to write code or create images or come up with

105
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,360
Speaker 3:  brilliant emails that just sound like you and long term, if Richard

106
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,360
Speaker 3:  has it right you.com will also become something like the smartphone,

107
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,720
Speaker 3:  a platform on which you can do almost anything all through this one

108
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,600
Speaker 3:  interface. Richard has been in the tech industry for a long time

109
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,360
Speaker 3:  and he's been working on problems of natural language processing for even

110
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,080
Speaker 3:  longer. He actually did a PhD at Stanford on bringing neural

111
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,040
Speaker 3:  networks, which is kind of an AI system to natural language processing,

112
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,640
Speaker 3:  which was at that time a huge leap forward in rethinking how

113
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,440
Speaker 3:  computers process speech point is he knows the history of all this, he knows

114
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,000
Speaker 3:  how it works, he knows how hard it has been to pull this off and he told

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,520
Speaker 3:  me that over the last decade as he saw this tech get better,

116
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,640
Speaker 3:  he thought this might be the moment to do it.

117
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,240
Speaker 3:  What he wanted to build was a chatbot kind of and an assistant. Sure.

118
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,240
Speaker 3:  But he looked at all his research on language and conversation and

119
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,080
Speaker 3:  natural language processing and how we interact with computers and he decided

120
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,000
Speaker 3:  the thing he really needed to do was build a different kind of search

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,320
Speaker 3:  engine.

122
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,040
Speaker 6:  The biggest application of natural language understanding is in search.

123
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,000
Speaker 6:  That's where billions of people learn something, try to find

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Speaker 6:  information, try to get things done, and they start all

125
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,720
Speaker 6:  of these tasks on a search engine. And so do

126
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,400
Speaker 6:  I want to necessarily call that a search engine? It almost

127
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,920
Speaker 6:  doesn't matter what you call it, but it is that sort of magical

128
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,520
Speaker 6:  spot in the beginning of many people's online journey

129
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,800
Speaker 6:  where you sit to be able to be helpful for those

130
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Speaker 6:  users. And so that's sort of led me, what led me to search

131
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,280
Speaker 3:  That like distinction of what you call it I actually think is like part of

132
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,840
Speaker 3:  the reason I'm so fascinated by you.com. 'cause I think you're absolute,

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,680
Speaker 3:  I mean you're obviously right that search is kind of the dominant

134
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,680
Speaker 3:  interface for this kind of natural language processing and the idea of

135
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,600
Speaker 3:  just like how people search for information. But simultaneously, even

136
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,080
Speaker 3:  as you're starting to think about how to apply neural networks to this stuff,

137
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,000
Speaker 3:  like obviously you were thinking about this stuff before Chad g p t

138
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,120
Speaker 3:  was around showing, you know, new chat body ideas

139
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,000
Speaker 3:  about how this stuff could work. But you were, you were playing with this

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Speaker 3:  technology for a long time and I, I can imagine a world that is

141
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,480
Speaker 3:  not that different from this world where you went much more down the like

142
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,520
Speaker 3:  Siri, Alexa, Google assistant route rather than kind of

143
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,320
Speaker 3:  building something that looks like a search engine even to accomplish

144
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,600
Speaker 3:  relatively the same goal, right? Am I, am I thinking about that the wrong

145
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,320
Speaker 3:  way? Like are those two things kind of further apart in your brain than they

146
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,800
Speaker 3:  are in mine?

147
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,960
Speaker 6:  You couldn't be more spot on. And it's actually very timely too because

148
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,440
Speaker 6:  we dropped the word search engine from you.com. Oh

149
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:02,920
Speaker 3:  Interesting.

150
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,880
Speaker 6:  Okay. We're now just like make it very clear that this is going to be a

151
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,600
Speaker 6:  conversation and that we're an AI chat assistant

152
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,840
Speaker 6:  that's going to help you learn and get more things done,

153
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,080
Speaker 6:  help you summarize and, and all of these things. And so that's

154
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,760
Speaker 6:  exactly how we're we actually repositioned

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,720
Speaker 6:  ourselves after many years we've learned that really search

156
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,080
Speaker 6:  engines do not inspire excitement from people.

157
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,240
Speaker 6:  But an AI chat assistant that helps you with finding information

158
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,400
Speaker 6:  and answers and learn and so on does excite people.

159
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,720
Speaker 6:  They're ultimately the same thing. It is a marketing question. We still

160
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,800
Speaker 6:  want to be able to say this can be the default in your browser. You know,

161
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,400
Speaker 6:  you can start every question you have in your browser, in your u l nav bar,

162
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,320
Speaker 6:  it defaults to you.com because that's where you get the most useful

163
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,080
Speaker 6:  first step in many different intents that you have. But yeah,

164
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,000
Speaker 6:  we're moving away from the term search engine and to

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,360
Speaker 6:  be honest, and I probably shouldn't say this, but we don't have it finalized

166
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,320
Speaker 6:  yet, what the new terminology should be. The

167
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,280
Speaker 6:  place we want to be is be the most helpful assistant that you

168
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,160
Speaker 6:  can be. Which honestly is also something that Google has worked on for many

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,840
Speaker 6:  years as well.

170
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,640
Speaker 3:  Part of what seems like has changed since you started working@u.com is that

171
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,360
Speaker 3:  I think one thing that you did that was very smart at the beginning was make

172
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,920
Speaker 3:  it look like a search engine. Just because I think that's like a thing people

173
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,880
Speaker 3:  understand that's right. What to do with right? That like even

174
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,680
Speaker 3:  in the way that I think a lot of people open chat G P T now and it's like,

175
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,000
Speaker 3:  well what do I do with this? People instinctively understand what to do when

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Speaker 3:  they open a webpage that looks like Google. So building a webpage that kind

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
Speaker 3:  of looks like Google makes a lot of sense. Even if what you're doing on the

178
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,600
Speaker 3:  other side of that ends up being very different. Do, do you think that's

179
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,840
Speaker 3:  changing, that you can make something that looks less and less like

180
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,080
Speaker 3:  a Google query page and start to bring people along with you into

181
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,960
Speaker 3:  all that other stuff now?

182
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it sounds like you're in our meetings that's, that's

183
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,400
Speaker 6:  very astute, very astute observation too here. This is something we,

184
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,520
Speaker 6:  we exactly found that last year. We had in the summer

185
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,680
Speaker 6:  the first LMS within a search engine context and

186
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,440
Speaker 6:  we tried to innovate over the last two and a half years

187
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,800
Speaker 6:  along a lot of different dimensions of what could

188
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,040
Speaker 6:  con in the past be called a search engine. We tried, you know, we had

189
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,440
Speaker 6:  horizontal scroll where you just see a few sources and then you can always

190
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,480
Speaker 6:  dive deeper into it very quickly. And we had, you know,

191
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,320
Speaker 6:  different apps that are within that search engine context. And

192
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,200
Speaker 6:  what we would often hear from users until late last

193
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,960
Speaker 6:  year was, that's interesting, but I'm just so used to

194
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,840
Speaker 6:  Google, I wouldn't wanna switch to anything that's too different. And it

195
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,560
Speaker 6:  ha we kept getting pulled back by users in our journey

196
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,900
Speaker 6:  to something that is more and more similar to Google and it was quite

197
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,820
Speaker 6:  frustrating. 'cause you know, we had some good ideas we thought and we, you

198
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,700
Speaker 6:  know, in each of these ideas we had a core, a hardcore group

199
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,740
Speaker 6:  of of power users who did love it, but it's just wasn't growing enough.

200
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,700
Speaker 6:  And the majority of feedback we kept getting is it's two different

201
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,700
Speaker 6:  to Google, it's two different to Google. I want something like that's more

202
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,340
Speaker 6:  similar but just a little bit better here and there. And so that

203
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,340
Speaker 6:  all changed thanks to chat G B T all of a sudden

204
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,300
Speaker 6:  a lot of users, a lot of them early adopters, but more and

205
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,540
Speaker 6:  more just normal folks too, basically could

206
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,260
Speaker 6:  conceive a new world of finding and learning

207
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,060
Speaker 6:  about things in the world. And so that is kind of the biggest advantage

208
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,100
Speaker 6:  that we've had since chat. G B T came out and, you know, two and a

209
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,020
Speaker 6:  half weeks later we launched youth chat, which basically was the

210
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,940
Speaker 6:  first l m that is connected to the internet and hence can be up to

211
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,860
Speaker 6:  date factual and have citations for the facts that it tells you.

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,420
Speaker 6:  Making it much more trustworthy.

213
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,900
Speaker 3:  Okay, we need to take a break and then we're gonna come back and talk more

214
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,220
Speaker 3:  with Richard.

215
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,230
Speaker 2:  Support for this show comes from a w s. We are living

216
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,990
Speaker 2:  in the future and artificial intelligence is completely transforming

217
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,030
Speaker 2:  how business is done. But without an experienced developer on your

218
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,750
Speaker 2:  team, how can you make the most of these emerging technologies?

219
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,550
Speaker 2:  Amazon web services can help. A w s has been

220
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,430
Speaker 2:  democratizing access to AI and machine learning for companies and

221
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,390
Speaker 2:  customers. They've invested $100 million to build their

222
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,110
Speaker 2:  generative AI innovation center to help customers understand and

223
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,950
Speaker 2:  deploy generative AI to predict trends and prototype with

224
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,550
Speaker 2:  data-driven design. Just imagine how a W Ss can

225
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,510
Speaker 2:  transform your business. Learn

226
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,190
Speaker 2:  more@awsishow.com

227
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,390
Speaker 3:  Welcome back. Like we've been talking about, the uptick in AI

228
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,070
Speaker 3:  and natural language processing and voice assistance has been happening

229
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,030
Speaker 3:  kind of slowly and then all at once over the last decade or so. And

230
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,790
Speaker 3:  even though Siri still kind of sucks sometimes the underlying tech

231
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,710
Speaker 3:  really has come an incredibly long way in that time. But

232
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,230
Speaker 3:  I think if you wanted to pick the moment, the modern era of

233
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,070
Speaker 3:  conversational user interfaces really started, it would have to be the

234
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,590
Speaker 3:  launch of chat G P T last fall.

235
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,670
Speaker 3:  Something about this system that felt like it understood all your questions

236
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,630
Speaker 3:  and responded with human and helpful answers felt like

237
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,230
Speaker 3:  magic to a lot of people in a way that even Alexa and Google Assistant

238
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,310
Speaker 3:  just never did chat. G p T isn't perfect, obviously it's

239
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,830
Speaker 3:  a million miles away from perfect, but it seemed to make people think that

240
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,720
Speaker 3:  it might be someday and that there might be something revolutionary in that

241
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,480
Speaker 3:  this could be the way we access information, not by going to

242
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,440
Speaker 3:  google.com or scrolling stuff on your phone, but just by asking for it. That

243
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,200
Speaker 3:  felt huge, but now it's a year later and that

244
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,080
Speaker 3:  idea has taken a bit of a hit for one thing. We've all discovered the

245
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,120
Speaker 3:  many, many, many imperfections of the tech and also the ways in

246
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Speaker 3:  which conversations maybe aren't all that efficient. I think we're definitely

247
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,760
Speaker 3:  in the low part of the chatbot hype cycle. It'll get better, but

248
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,120
Speaker 3:  it's not what it once was.

249
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,200
Speaker 3:  Richard though started u.com before the chat G p T

250
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,160
Speaker 3:  explosion and so he's seen everything rise and fall and rise and

251
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,040
Speaker 3:  fall and all the parts of the hype cycle here and he's seen people

252
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,720
Speaker 3:  poke at the edges of the tech and really try to figure out where it breaks.

253
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,080
Speaker 3:  So what have we learned What can a virtual assistant do? And if and when

254
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,480
Speaker 3:  the tech really does work, how do we want it to work?

255
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,480
Speaker 3:  Richard says we're still learning. He's still learning, but he has some

256
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,680
Speaker 3:  pretty big ideas about it.

257
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,960
Speaker 6:  Like we, I love text, right? I love natural language processing, but

258
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,120
Speaker 6:  text isn't always the best way to communicate something.

259
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,760
Speaker 6:  Multimodal answers are the best way. So if you

260
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,680
Speaker 6:  ask you Chatt, what's the stock price of Palantir or

261
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,600
Speaker 6:  Salesforce or some company, we're not gonna just give you a bunch of numbers

262
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,000
Speaker 6:  at especially not those that are hallucinated sure by, by an

263
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,600
Speaker 6:  lmm. But we show you a stock ticker that's interactive, you can move your

264
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,400
Speaker 6:  mouse over, you can see the daily trends, the weekly trends that yearly trends,

265
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,680
Speaker 6:  the market cap and all of these different numbers and you just see it

266
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,840
Speaker 6:  directly within the chat window, right? And then you can ask like, well now

267
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,400
Speaker 6:  who's their c e o? And it still captures all the context and remembers which

268
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,080
Speaker 6:  company you talked about before and then, you know, gives you that company

269
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,200
Speaker 6:  c e o even though if you, you know, just did in a retrieval backend who's

270
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,160
Speaker 6:  their c e o, it wouldn't give you anything useful. But you know, we, we learn

271
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,360
Speaker 6:  to transform those queries as one of the many things that that, you know,

272
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,200
Speaker 6:  going on in the background that you have to get right in a lot of different

273
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,120
Speaker 6:  ways and very easy and obvious when you get it wrong. Easy mistakes

274
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,960
Speaker 6:  to make. And So, we believe the answer in the future

275
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,960
Speaker 6:  is going to be multimodal. And that's why we invented also last year

276
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,960
Speaker 6:  this app store where you can essentially, other people

277
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,960
Speaker 6:  can also submit apps to you.com and then they can show up

278
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,200
Speaker 6:  within the search results and within the chat response. And I think that

279
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,080
Speaker 6:  will ultimately be the best interface. Similar to, you know, giving me some

280
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,800
Speaker 6:  good restaurants around me. I, I still remember when speech recognition

281
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,520
Speaker 6:  start started to finally work and I started, you know, investing also after

282
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,160
Speaker 6:  my first company's acquisition. I had a bunch of folks say, oh, we're gonna

283
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,880
Speaker 6:  use speech recognition and to do all of these different things and it's gonna

284
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,800
Speaker 6:  be your personal assistant. I'm like, okay, well gimme an example. And one

285
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,840
Speaker 6:  of the founders was like, well the example is like you asked for a restaurant.

286
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,240
Speaker 6:  And I'm like, so you really say I have this like

287
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,080
Speaker 6:  speech system And I talked to it and I asked it like, what are some good

288
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,880
Speaker 6:  restaurants? And the response is, there are 150

289
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,080
Speaker 6:  restaurants around you. Number one has 4.3 stars. Their favorite

290
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,960
Speaker 6:  dish is Pat Thai and is 0.3 miles away from. And then like 10

291
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,720
Speaker 6:  hours later you'd have a sense of where to go. Like it doesn't make any sense.

292
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,240
Speaker 6:  And so, you know, I love ai, I love natural language processing,

293
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,440
Speaker 6:  but you have to have some user empathy and try to build,

294
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,840
Speaker 6:  build it in a way that meets people where they are and, and not be too

295
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,760
Speaker 6:  much. Like this is the new hammer, everything is a nail kind of thing.

296
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,680
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I mean it's, it's kind of a amazing how many systems

297
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,880
Speaker 3:  work like that redo all the restaurants in the neighborhood thing.

298
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,720
Speaker 3:  Like that's where we are with so many things right now. I guess the app store

299
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,240
Speaker 3:  thing was gonna be my follow-up question, which is like, how much of this

300
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,200
Speaker 3:  do you feel obligated to build yourself versus how much can you kind of

301
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,080
Speaker 3:  create the ecosystem for? And I guess I do still wonder that like, especially

302
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,200
Speaker 3:  as it grows in the capabilities grow and there's a lot more things to do.

303
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,720
Speaker 3:  How much of that space is kind of you dot com's job

304
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,680
Speaker 3:  versus being, you know, the platform on which all of this other

305
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,240
Speaker 3:  stuff exists,

306
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,560
Speaker 6:  Huh? Maybe we should hire you now product team. Yeah. That, that

307
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,680
Speaker 6:  is the big, the billion, trillion dollar question. I think

308
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,320
Speaker 6:  long term it's very clear to me that it cannot be all

309
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,320
Speaker 6:  on us and an a system that ultimately lets you accomplish anything

310
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,280
Speaker 6:  and encompasses the entire economy. But it's also

311
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,960
Speaker 6:  clear that there's a cold start problem here. People don't want to build

312
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,000
Speaker 6:  an app on a platform that haven't, doesn't have hundreds of millions of users.

313
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,240
Speaker 6:  Hundreds of millions of users aren't gonna come to your platform if you

314
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,480
Speaker 6:  don't already provide enough functionality

315
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,880
Speaker 6:  to fulfill most of their needs in a really, really

316
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,760
Speaker 6:  good way. And some needs better than anyone else ever or anywhere else.

317
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,600
Speaker 6:  And so that's the cold start problem. So in the beginning it is mostly

318
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,640
Speaker 6:  on us and then I hope over time it transitions and we'll get more and

319
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,600
Speaker 6:  more high quality apps into the ecosystem. And I think that will ultimately

320
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,440
Speaker 6:  be a more fair way of structuring that first

321
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,840
Speaker 6:  page of the internet that currently, you know, Google benefits from everyone

322
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,120
Speaker 6:  else on the internet, but then they don't benefit back right that much other

323
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,600
Speaker 6:  than of course, you know, paying for ads and traffic and having to pay for

324
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,560
Speaker 6:  even their own ads on their own name, just so that there's not a competitor

325
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,760
Speaker 6:  that outbids them on their own name and then they show up on top and like

326
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,960
Speaker 6:  all of these things. So I think it's a better way and a fair way to

327
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,640
Speaker 6:  have ultimately a chat portal again. But I think

328
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,560
Speaker 6:  portals also have a bad marketing connotation and So, we might not call it

329
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:21,760
Speaker 6:  that.

330
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I always thought the one, one of the things you guys did really well

331
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,800
Speaker 3:  from the very beginning was kind of let people just tell

332
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,880
Speaker 3:  you the sources they like better. I've never understood why every search

333
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,800
Speaker 3:  engine doesn't just let me say I really like these four news

334
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,600
Speaker 3:  websites and I'm not that interested in seeing other news websites. Like

335
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,840
Speaker 3:  it seems like such a straightforward thing and I feel like the app store

336
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,600
Speaker 3:  model really just builds on that in a lot of ways, right? You get to curate

337
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,040
Speaker 3:  That's right, right? Like, here is the stuff I wanna see and the ways I wanna

338
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,840
Speaker 3:  see it and others can tap into that. And that's a pretty

339
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,640
Speaker 3:  powerful kind of feedback loop, which I think is very cool.

340
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,920
Speaker 6:  Yeah, in the, in the pre-chat days, Reddit was one of our favorite

341
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,560
Speaker 6:  apps of our users. Yeah. How

342
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,120
Speaker 3:  Do you think about personalization? I mean it seems to me that the perfect

343
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,960
Speaker 3:  version of this, you know, years down the road or however long it takes

344
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,160
Speaker 3:  is an assistant that effectively knows everything about me,

345
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,160
Speaker 3:  right? And knows where I am and what I like and what I'm interested in and

346
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,040
Speaker 3:  on and on and on. And obviously that has big privacy

347
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,600
Speaker 3:  questions, which I want to talk about, but also just like logistically is

348
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,560
Speaker 3:  very hard to do. And I, I'm, I'm just thinking about like search is

349
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,040
Speaker 3:  one thing where it's just kind of up ranking and down ranking web pages,

350
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,040
Speaker 3:  but like if you're trying to help me do stuff, getting information from

351
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,000
Speaker 3:  me seems really important, but also like the kind of thing you don't want

352
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,440
Speaker 3:  too, too much of or you're gonna lose people. Like how do you, how do you

353
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,200
Speaker 3:  think about that?

354
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,400
Speaker 6:  That's right. Yeah. It's something we have been working on for, for

355
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,000
Speaker 6:  many months. You have to know when to do this

356
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,600
Speaker 6:  and when it's not that useful, if you just want to add no, like when was

357
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,320
Speaker 6:  Barack Obama born? It doesn't really make that much sense to be like,

358
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,600
Speaker 6:  well maybe he liked mountain biking too, sometimes, you know, it's like,

359
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,880
Speaker 6:  that's not what I asked for, right? I just asked you a simple question. I

360
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,720
Speaker 6:  want to get a simple fact. And so to not overly personalize, but

361
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,480
Speaker 6:  to know when to do it well and, and when to reuse the facts

362
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,480
Speaker 6:  and then also do it make it seamless for the user. So it's just feels like,

363
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,480
Speaker 6:  oh yeah, like the more I use this, the better it gets for me without

364
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,440
Speaker 6:  being too creepy either and, and still having control over their

365
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,880
Speaker 6:  private information in a way that, you know, makes them feel

366
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,360
Speaker 6:  safe is very important.

367
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,880
Speaker 3:  So what, what are you seeing as, as folks are really starting to embrace

368
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,840
Speaker 3:  the kind of chat assistant piece of this? Obviously the

369
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,520
Speaker 3:  like, help me write an email, help me with my code thing

370
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,000
Speaker 3:  seem to be two sort of killer apps for people. Is there other stuff you're

371
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,560
Speaker 3:  seeing that's jumping out at you as kind of nascent use cases here?

372
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,680
Speaker 6:  Yeah, a ton of things. I think students are going to have a

373
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,760
Speaker 6:  really great time on you.com. We just launched a back to school

374
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,040
Speaker 6:  campaign two, it's now the cheapest way to access GBT four

375
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,160
Speaker 6:  plus, you know, have access to the internet for that chatbot. And on that

376
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,960
Speaker 6:  front too soon we will have a whole new class of

377
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,880
Speaker 6:  questions that are very complex that no other

378
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,080
Speaker 6:  normal lmm chatbot can currently solve

379
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,160
Speaker 6:  accurately, but often pretends to be able to solve and then does make a lot

380
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,040
Speaker 6:  of mistakes, which I think is, is very problematic. It's just

381
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,080
Speaker 6:  a whole new class of, of problems that can be answered with

382
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,760
Speaker 6:  an AI that has just more, more superpowers than just

383
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,680
Speaker 6:  an a large language model. But yeah, for now I think I still

384
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,760
Speaker 6:  see a lot of potential for parents, you know, for,

385
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,720
Speaker 6:  for folks who want to find new recipes for people who'd wanna do

386
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,440
Speaker 6:  travel planning and get like nice ideas for itineraries

387
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,040
Speaker 6:  that are going to be much more personalized also in the coming coming weeks

388
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,840
Speaker 6:  on new.com and then students getting answers for their questions. I'm,

389
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,240
Speaker 6:  I'm excited also to incorporate more and more generative AI capabilities

390
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,280
Speaker 6:  into these, you know, if you ask like, how can I generate an image with AI

391
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,640
Speaker 6:  Then, we just let you do that right then and there. If you're on your pro,

392
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,320
Speaker 6:  you can do it as often as you want. And so yeah, lots of lots of

393
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,360
Speaker 6:  interesting use cases. I think the more where we are still

394
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,280
Speaker 6:  iterating on is like when to make it just as good as Google

395
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,880
Speaker 6:  for the quick navigational stuff and the quick informational stuff, and then

396
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,160
Speaker 6:  when can we really shine by being much more chat

397
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,480
Speaker 6:  first?

398
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,960
Speaker 3:  Right? And you do kind of have to do both, right? Even though the navigational

399
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,920
Speaker 3:  stuff is ultimately not that interesting. That's the, like, that's a

400
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,520
Speaker 3:  big part of the sort of habit building of it, right? And and if you really

401
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,680
Speaker 3:  want to be the kind of homepage of the internet for people,

402
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,040
Speaker 3:  you have to do that as well or better than Google.

403
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,720
Speaker 6:  That's exactly right. You know, and there are a lot of like chat bots out

404
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,120
Speaker 6:  there that some of them I think are a little bit, you know, they have their

405
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,080
Speaker 6:  hype moments, but because they're just not connected

406
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,400
Speaker 6:  to the internet, they're not that factual and up to date they give you, sometimes

407
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,200
Speaker 6:  they even give you citations but don't actually, when you click on the

408
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,600
Speaker 6:  citation, you don't see the facts that they're saying, you know, that was

409
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,240
Speaker 6:  the citation for, it's not at all on that page and, and that that

410
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,400
Speaker 6:  loses a lot of trust after a while. And so, you know, there's, there's a

411
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,160
Speaker 6:  lot of like sort of brief hype chats, but I think

412
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,160
Speaker 6:  to have a really long-term shot, you need to have the

413
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,000
Speaker 6:  utility that is more similar to a search engine, not just be like

414
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,920
Speaker 6:  a dictionary lookup kind of thing that you use once a week.

415
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,280
Speaker 3:  Yeah, totally. As a, I think the idea of an AI chat bot

416
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,160
Speaker 3:  is like a complimentary thing is kind of interesting, but it is like a primary

417
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,800
Speaker 3:  interface to the internet is where this stuff starts to get really interesting.

418
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,160
Speaker 3:  And I think, I think that's coming, but it's displacing Google is harder

419
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,960
Speaker 3:  than most people give it credit for is the thing I have learned over and

420
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,320
Speaker 3:  over and over in the time I've been in this world.

421
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,440
Speaker 6:  That's exactly right.

422
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,080
Speaker 3:  So last thing, talk to me about privacy just for a minute. I know it's, it's

423
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,520
Speaker 3:  a thing you guys have talked a lot about. I know the, the kind of all of

424
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,400
Speaker 3:  this stuff we're talking about utility and personalization and all this

425
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,280
Speaker 3:  stuff often kind of runs directly against privacy. Do you have

426
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,880
Speaker 3:  a strategy for kind of how to have your cake and eat it too here? Like how

427
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,040
Speaker 3:  do you, how do you think you can do right by all those things at the same

428
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,160
Speaker 3:  time?

429
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,720
Speaker 6:  Yeah, great question. We, we used to talk a lot about privacy

430
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,760
Speaker 6:  and we still care about it, but we don't talk about it as much because

431
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,880
Speaker 6:  to be honest, it doesn't e excite enough people. You just can't

432
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,640
Speaker 6:  grow quickly enough a consumer business by just talking

433
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,040
Speaker 6:  a lot about privacy. There are few folks that that can, and they, you know,

434
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,160
Speaker 6:  Dr. Go obviously is like amazing on that front, but we just

435
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,920
Speaker 6:  didn't see the growth from having a, a

436
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,240
Speaker 6:  strong focus on it. And it does in many, many cases

437
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,560
Speaker 6:  slow you down. Like people want to have no bugs and they wanna

438
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,320
Speaker 6:  know that things work, but if you were to never, ever do any, any

439
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,840
Speaker 6:  analytics, you don't know how happy you are making your users,

440
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,640
Speaker 6:  right? And so in many cases we didn't use, you know, we don't use Google

441
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,440
Speaker 6:  Analytics and so on to have the best privacy of any of these chat

442
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,120
Speaker 6:  engines. And when you look at pretty much all our chat competitors, all of

443
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,880
Speaker 6:  them are selling your chat transcripts and your data

444
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,840
Speaker 6:  to others. Maybe not always like specifically, but like, like attached to

445
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,000
Speaker 6:  your IP or something like that. But they're all like using Google analytics

446
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,040
Speaker 6:  and, and, and all of that. And so we're trying our best to

447
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,680
Speaker 6:  be the most private of those engines. But to be honest,

448
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:27,080
Speaker 6:  we've also, when you talk about it a lot, there's just some people who will

449
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,440
Speaker 6:  never be happy until you're an open source like

450
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,520
Speaker 6:  nonprofit on the tour network that like makes no, no

451
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,160
Speaker 6:  revenue like, and has no ads or anything like, and, and that's just

452
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,360
Speaker 6:  not a viable, viable business strategy either. And so, so yeah,

453
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,120
Speaker 6:  we care about it. We think we're the best private chat

454
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,160
Speaker 6:  engine and chat assistant out there, but we don't, we just don't talk

455
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,520
Speaker 6:  about it as much as, as other features that people seem to care about more.

456
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,880
Speaker 6:  And that helped us grow to many more millions of users than than before.

457
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,720
Speaker 3:  A little while after Richard and I talked, u.com rolled out a feature that

458
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,680
Speaker 3:  he hinted at a couple of times in our interview, it's called You Agent and

459
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,360
Speaker 3:  it's able to do everything from calculations to code execution for you.

460
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,920
Speaker 3:  One of the examples u.com gives is calculating your mortgage, feed it all

461
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,120
Speaker 3:  the data you care about, the amount of your loan, the time, the interest

462
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,000
Speaker 3:  rate, and the agent will run the numbers and spit a payment back to you.

463
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,280
Speaker 3:  This is a fairly benign example, right? There are a million ways to do mortgage

464
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,040
Speaker 3:  calculations on the internet, but u.com also says it plans to support things

465
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,000
Speaker 3:  like file uploads and graphical outputs and much more. So

466
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,840
Speaker 3:  the idea I think is that you could upload all of your mortgage docs and then

467
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,480
Speaker 3:  essentially have the agent explain them to you and do things with them and

468
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,000
Speaker 3:  even do things on your behalf with them. That is some

469
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,760
Speaker 3:  seriously cool virtual assistant stuff. I know I've said this already,

470
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,680
Speaker 3:  but it's important to keep saying that the tech for this all still is

471
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,840
Speaker 3:  not finished. The underlying models are getting better, but they're wrong

472
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,040
Speaker 3:  too often. They make things up too often. They don't show their work often

473
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,040
Speaker 3:  enough and they also just sometimes don't understand what you mean at

474
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,720
Speaker 3:  all. Plus, I really increasingly don't buy the vision that

475
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,400
Speaker 3:  chat is the future of everything, no matter what AI or binging or whoever

476
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,320
Speaker 3:  else would tell you. I don't think typing into a text box is the future of

477
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,320
Speaker 3:  the universe, but I'm more convinced than ever that the superpowered

478
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,480
Speaker 3:  virtual assistant we've been dreaming about and trying to build for more

479
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,640
Speaker 3:  than half a century might finally be here soon

480
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,320
Speaker 3:  and it's gonna be awesome.

481
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,840
Speaker 3:  All right, that's it for the show today. And that's it for our AI mini series.

482
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,000
Speaker 3:  We have had so much fun making this series. I really hope you've enjoyed

483
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,720
Speaker 3:  listening to it as well. We've also got a bunch more fun special stuff coming

484
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
