Description: Today on the flagship podcast of refillable scent cartridges: 
Producer Andru Marino tries out a gadget called the Gamescent, an AI-powered scent machine that syncs with your gaming and movie watching experience. He walks David Pierce through the experience and whether integrating olfaction could be the future of gaming. 
We also hear from Nimesha Ranasinghe, an assistant professor at the University of Maine working on taste sensations and taste simulation in virtual reality experiences, which can lead to adding another sense into the world of gaming. 

2
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:06,325
Speaker 3:  joystick crisis, both super fun episodes. If, you haven't listened to them,

3
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:10,085
Speaker 3:  go do so. But I would be lying to you if I said this is not the episode I

4
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:13,565
Speaker 3:  was the most excited about. We gave our producer Andrew Marino, I would say

5
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:17,485
Speaker 3:  the roughly impossible task of taking the two senses

6
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:21,325
Speaker 3:  that make the least sense in the context of this series and trying to

7
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:25,125
Speaker 3:  figure them both out. Those two senses are taste and Smell.

8
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:29,285
Speaker 3:  How do you do that in games? Let's find out. Andrew Marino. Welcome.

9
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:30,525
Speaker 4:  Hi. Hi David.

10
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:33,485
Speaker 3:  You knew I was gonna give you this episode, didn't you? I

11
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:34,485
Speaker 4:  Would've fought for it.

12
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:39,445
Speaker 3:  I'm glad. So where do you wanna start? I, I feel like we, we just sort of

13
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:42,845
Speaker 3:  sense you on a, like God only knows where this is gonna go adventure. Let's

14
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:45,765
Speaker 3:  see, let's see what you can come up with. Yeah, where do you wanna start?

15
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:49,685
Speaker 4:  Okay, so let's just bring up the idea of where Smell would even go

16
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:53,725
Speaker 4:  in in this stuff. Right. Okay. So you may remember the

17
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,765
Speaker 4:  term Smellovision. Oh yeah. Yes.

18
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:00,405
Speaker 3:  I honestly could not tell you if that's a real thing that ever existed or

19
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:03,005
Speaker 3:  not, but I have heard, I have heard of Smellovision before.

20
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:07,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. People just use it as a term for like broadcasting smells,

21
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:11,285
Speaker 4:  you know, but it was actually a product at one point, there was a movie

22
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,685
Speaker 4:  in 1960 called The Scent of Mystery.

23
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:17,765
Speaker 5:  Scent of Mystery.

24
00:02:22,345 --> 00:02:26,045
Speaker 4:  And it was a movie that used this technology called Spion.

25
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:30,165
Speaker 4:  They had like this whole machine built where there was like

26
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:34,085
Speaker 4:  kind of like how a soundtrack in a film strip would be like

27
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:38,165
Speaker 4:  there's just triggers for when scents would come Throughout the film

28
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:41,525
Speaker 4:  there was like 15 scents that were deployed into the audience.

29
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:45,845
Speaker 4:  So there was a villain in the movie who smoked a pipe. So whenever that villain

30
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,565
Speaker 4:  was on screen you could Smell the tobacco from his pipe

31
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:53,925
Speaker 4:  and it was supposed to be like the future of cinema. They were just like,

32
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:57,845
Speaker 4:  we got sound, we got visuals. Now we gotta add another thing.

33
00:02:57,865 --> 00:02:59,245
Speaker 4:  And that's Smell. The other

34
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,325
Speaker 3:  Important part of movies

35
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:04,805
Speaker 4:  Now, like you still kind of see that. I don't know if you've ever been to

36
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:07,525
Speaker 4:  one of those four DX theater experiences.

37
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:11,085
Speaker 3:  Those are the ones with like the, the seats that rumble when there's action

38
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:14,725
Speaker 3:  sequences and stuff. Right. To that extent, I think four DX is super fun,

39
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:18,965
Speaker 3:  but every time there's one of these, I remember this thing from, it

40
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,845
Speaker 3:  was the Honey I Shrunk the Kids Yes Thing at Disney World, which to me is

41
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:25,925
Speaker 3:  like the canonical version of all of this to me. And there's a moment in

42
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:29,725
Speaker 3:  it where a bunch of rats are scurrying around and they actually had

43
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:33,245
Speaker 3:  the rats scurry underneath you and it freaked me out. Like genuinely

44
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:34,765
Speaker 3:  earnestly scared me. I

45
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:38,485
Speaker 4:  Am still s scarred from that. That's so funny you brought that up. I remember

46
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,045
Speaker 4:  the tails. There's tails at the bottom of the chair. It's

47
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:44,725
Speaker 3:  Awful. I don't like it at all. And so that forever has

48
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:48,325
Speaker 3:  ruined the idea of 40 x for me, even though I think the like rumble when

49
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,045
Speaker 3:  you're in the car thing is actually pretty cool.

50
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:54,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah, a lot of them don't do this since apparently there's a theater in

51
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:58,125
Speaker 4:  Japan that has like a thousand different scents you can load into a movie.

52
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:02,445
Speaker 4:  But we're talking about video games here, so how do we do this in

53
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:03,725
Speaker 4:  video games? Yeah, that

54
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:06,765
Speaker 3:  Seems like a really different problem to me. Yeah, you can't just like load

55
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,445
Speaker 3:  the track with the smells I guess.

56
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:12,525
Speaker 4:  Right? 'cause it's so interactive. Once we got into like the desktop

57
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:16,645
Speaker 4:  era of computers, there was this company called Eye Smell

58
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:17,685
Speaker 3:  Amazing. Which

59
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:20,525
Speaker 4:  Is just an amazing name for Verizon Company

60
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,045
Speaker 3:  And this is in the nineties. So they were, they were ahead of their time

61
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:24,525
Speaker 3:  on Eye Smell. Yeah.

62
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:28,085
Speaker 4:  In 1999 there was like a USB device you'd plug into your computer.

63
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:31,765
Speaker 4:  It would work with like websites and programmers to

64
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:36,045
Speaker 4:  install these like Smell activation files where

65
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:40,325
Speaker 4:  it would release a scent when you click on something in a, in a game or

66
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,525
Speaker 4:  a website. Yeah.

67
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:44,685
Speaker 6:  You can imagine Tomb Raider you're going through different spots and you

68
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,965
Speaker 6:  know, smelling mold and mildew and animals and

69
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:51,565
Speaker 6:  tapestries and then shoot 'em up game. Of course that can get pretty gross

70
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:54,525
Speaker 6:  when you say this game stinks. It might be a compliment

71
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:58,885
Speaker 4:  That never took off in 2006. PC World Magazine listed

72
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:02,605
Speaker 4:  I Smell as one of the worst tech products of all time. Oof.

73
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:03,525
Speaker 3:  That's tough.

74
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:07,445
Speaker 4:  So there's a, you know, there's a lot of challenges there. I don't know if

75
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:11,405
Speaker 4:  people were ready for scent in video games. We are still, you know,

76
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:14,845
Speaker 4:  we're still getting the visuals and sound right at that point. But now

77
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:17,085
Speaker 4:  technology has progressed. David,

78
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:20,605
Speaker 7:  Guys, guys, guys, guys. Okay. Smell of vision.

79
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:22,245
Speaker 7:  It's real.

80
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:26,645
Speaker 4:  There's been lots of prototypes. I've seen Linus, Tech Tips did a

81
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:30,085
Speaker 4:  video with something called the Celia, which worked with a game called

82
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:31,645
Speaker 4:  Adventure Climb vr.

83
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:34,685
Speaker 7:  Oh my god. I can to,

84
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:38,005
Speaker 7:  I can totally Smell the water.

85
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:42,525
Speaker 4:  This fan will blow scents on you if you're in like the wooded area or

86
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:43,325
Speaker 4:  like near water.

87
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:44,085
Speaker 3:  Okay.

88
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:48,085
Speaker 4:  There's some innovative stuff there. But I actually found

89
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:52,245
Speaker 4:  one product that is shipping does add scent

90
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:55,925
Speaker 4:  to your game and they promise to work with any video game

91
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:59,525
Speaker 4:  console and any streaming platform. It's called Game Scent.

92
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:00,605
Speaker 4:  Have you heard of this?

93
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:04,005
Speaker 3:  I'm guessing this is the sort of thing that we would've seen and been like,

94
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:07,205
Speaker 3:  well that'll never amount to anything and then just all sort of forgot about

95
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:11,045
Speaker 3:  in this long history of Smell products. Yeah, but you're telling me it's

96
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:11,205
Speaker 3:  real.

97
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:15,365
Speaker 4:  It's real. We're here. Smell of vision is back in

98
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:19,525
Speaker 4:  games. It's made by a company called Elevated Perceptions. You can

99
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:22,805
Speaker 4:  buy it right now on Amazon. You can hook it up to your Xbox, you can hook

100
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:26,445
Speaker 4:  it up to your switch or whatever. It's like this hexagon

101
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:30,285
Speaker 4:  box that you hook up to your console. It has six spray

102
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:34,285
Speaker 4:  nozzles each with a different fragrance. So when you're playing a game

103
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:38,365
Speaker 4:  it will just eject some, it's like an oil diffuser.

104
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:42,125
Speaker 4:  Okay, sure. And it's powered by

105
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:42,685
Speaker 4:  ai.

106
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:46,525
Speaker 3:  Oh God Andrew. Well that's the end of the episode. No

107
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:50,285
Speaker 4:  David hear me out. AI is going to solve

108
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:54,365
Speaker 4:  Smell of Vision. Okay. We're finally at a point where this

109
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,845
Speaker 4:  is actually gonna work because you know previously in all these examples

110
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:01,685
Speaker 4:  I talked about, you have to map it to the game, to the movie

111
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,125
Speaker 4:  before you play it. You know,

112
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:06,765
Speaker 3:  Like the track you're talking about, it actually doesn't work If, you don't

113
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:10,325
Speaker 3:  have the like cue points for the sense

114
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:11,125
Speaker 3:  Exactly.

115
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:14,045
Speaker 4:  So you'd have to work with the video game developer, you'd have to work with

116
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:17,845
Speaker 4:  the movie distributor to sync everything. But what Game Sent is doing

117
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,765
Speaker 4:  instead is you're actually just running an audio signal to

118
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:25,405
Speaker 4:  the game scent from your game console through this little adapter

119
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:28,765
Speaker 4:  which syncs to that hexagon box called the

120
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:32,885
Speaker 4:  Atomizer. And so the adapter is listening to the sound

121
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:36,885
Speaker 4:  in the game, sending it to a cloud server and then some AI

122
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,765
Speaker 4:  software is figuring out what those sounds are and then it tells the

123
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:44,805
Speaker 4:  atomizer to deploy those sense. So it's related to what you're hearing

124
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:46,205
Speaker 4:  in the game. I

125
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:49,885
Speaker 3:  Can't tell If you just described something really clever or that is like

126
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:53,685
Speaker 3:  the most hacky hack in the history of hacks

127
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:56,445
Speaker 3:  and I think it, it's actually probably both as I'm thinking about this now.

128
00:07:56,765 --> 00:08:00,605
Speaker 4:  I think so. Yeah it's super clever because yeah you don't have to map

129
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,325
Speaker 4:  it to any game. You can use literally any game. You can watch literally any

130
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:05,565
Speaker 4:  movie with it. It's

131
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:09,525
Speaker 3:  A lot of smells though. Andrew, what what? What are the scents in this

132
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:09,685
Speaker 3:  thing?

133
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:13,765
Speaker 4:  It's a lot of smells. The starter pack that comes with it

134
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:17,925
Speaker 4:  is gunfire racing cars, explosions

135
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:22,165
Speaker 4:  forest storm and then a neutralizing scent

136
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:26,125
Speaker 4:  or called clean air scent. So those are the six that come

137
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:27,045
Speaker 4:  in the box

138
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:31,005
Speaker 3:  I love you can just tell what kind of game and movie they're designing this

139
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:33,325
Speaker 3:  for. That three of them are just action movie things.

140
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:38,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So like the game sent hears gunshot noises, it will

141
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:42,405
Speaker 4:  deploy the gunfire, Smell If you hear leaves

142
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:45,925
Speaker 4:  rustling and birds chirping. You might Smell the forest

143
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:49,685
Speaker 4:  scent from the device like If. you played this podcast

144
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:54,165
Speaker 4:  through the game scent. I'll just play some thunder and rain sounds right

145
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:54,325
Speaker 4:  now.

146
00:08:57,865 --> 00:09:01,765
Speaker 4:  The game scent should hear that and then it will deploy the storm

147
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:06,045
Speaker 4:  scent. So they want people to use this for movies and and whatever too.

148
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:10,365
Speaker 3:  Okay, so you mentioned a few minutes ago that this thing is available to

149
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:14,245
Speaker 3:  buy on Amazon. I'm begging you to tell me that was foreshadowing and that

150
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:15,965
Speaker 3:  you have one of these things and you can tell me how it works.

151
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:20,125
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, I got, I got the game scent. So after this little break

152
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:23,725
Speaker 4:  we'll have, I'll get into my experience with using the game scent and see

153
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:27,005
Speaker 4:  how it actually does with Smell of Vision in 2024.

154
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:27,685
Speaker 3:  Oh my god,

155
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:38,685
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. Andrew Marino, you have a game cent in your life

156
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,845
Speaker 3:  right now and you have not told me about it. I am desperate to know about

157
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,165
Speaker 3:  your experience with the Game Cent. How'd it go?

158
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:48,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I was so excited to play with this. I reached out to game set and the

159
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:51,845
Speaker 4:  company sent me a unit to try out for The. Vergecast. When I

160
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:55,405
Speaker 4:  got the package immediately it had a very strong

161
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:55,965
Speaker 4:  set.

162
00:10:57,915 --> 00:11:01,085
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I think some oil leaked or something 'cause it's very strong

163
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:07,365
Speaker 4:  And so as I was opening the glass vials of fragrance,

164
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:10,565
Speaker 4:  I noticed that one of them was actually shattered.

165
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:11,405
Speaker 9:  Oh no.

166
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,285
Speaker 9:  The clean air sent,

167
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:19,525
Speaker 9:  it's broken. I wonder if that's why it was all oily

168
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:23,085
Speaker 9:  when I was spelling was clean air. Apparently

169
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:27,805
Speaker 3:  Better that than like gunfire or explosions though I guess.

170
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:28,445
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

171
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:32,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So all these little vials of oil, they probably should have

172
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:36,445
Speaker 4:  used different canisters. Like they're just generic glass containers. You

173
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,285
Speaker 4:  can screw the nozzle spray thing on it. But yeah, it,

174
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:44,125
Speaker 4:  so I didn't have the neutralizer scent anymore but I felt that was okay

175
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:48,045
Speaker 4:  because my entire apartment smelled like clean air for a

176
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,125
Speaker 4:  few days. So you just said

177
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,805
Speaker 3:  Infinite neutralizer Smell for a while. Yeah,

178
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:55,445
Speaker 4:  Exactly. But it was actually pretty easy to set up in my living room.

179
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:59,805
Speaker 4:  Usually as you know, devices that are connected to the internet and Bluetooth

180
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:03,485
Speaker 4:  can be a pain in the butt. So I was actually surprised how easy it was to

181
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:07,205
Speaker 4:  set up. I hooked it up to my Nintendo Switch, plug it into the audio

182
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:11,245
Speaker 4:  adapter, I put the atomizer on my coffee table and I

183
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:14,845
Speaker 4:  was sitting on the couch, plugged it in the wall and the first game I wanted

184
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:16,685
Speaker 4:  to try it out with was Mario Kart

185
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:22,085
Speaker 10:  For

186
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:25,765
Speaker 4:  The first lap or two, it wasn't really doing anything. I couldn't Smell anything.

187
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:30,205
Speaker 4:  But then suddenly something came through outside of

188
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:31,245
Speaker 4:  that clean air

189
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:32,605
Speaker 10:  Scent. Oh

190
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:35,365
Speaker 10:  I'm getting a new Smell.

191
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:37,645
Speaker 10:  Oh

192
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:42,085
Speaker 10:  I don't know, I don't know what it is.

193
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:44,325
Speaker 10:  So

194
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:47,885
Speaker 4:  It was working but some of the scents were just like too hard to

195
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:51,805
Speaker 4:  figure out like storm scent versus forest scent.

196
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:55,885
Speaker 3:  Can you see the scents coming out by the way? Like is there a steam thing

197
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:56,405
Speaker 3:  coming out?

198
00:12:56,745 --> 00:13:00,365
Speaker 4:  You can see it working. There's like a cloud of puff Okay. Coming out

199
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:02,525
Speaker 4:  and you will Smell it for sure. Even

200
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:03,845
Speaker 3:  If you can't tell exactly what it is.

201
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:06,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah, eventually it started to make sense.

202
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:08,325
Speaker 10:  Oh I'm getting

203
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:13,845
Speaker 10:  very like burnt kind of Smell. I think that's the racing car

204
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:17,645
Speaker 10:  Smell. I'm on the third lap and it just triggered that

205
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:20,685
Speaker 10:  so it kind of smells like burning tire.

206
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:25,925
Speaker 4:  I got the racing car Smell from playing Mario Kart. As you can

207
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,845
Speaker 4:  expect, that just kept going off for a bit, right?

208
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's, it's just racing cars the whole time.

209
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:35,285
Speaker 4:  Right, because you're always hearing turbo boosts and

210
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:39,045
Speaker 4:  engines revving and all that. Some other things I would activate the game

211
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:42,965
Speaker 4:  cent during Mario Kart was grumble volcano. That course

212
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,965
Speaker 4:  there's like an erupting volcano in the beginning and that deployed

213
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:50,485
Speaker 4:  the explosion scent bullet bill, that big bullet that

214
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:54,365
Speaker 4:  whizzes past you or hits you depending where you are in the race that

215
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:55,965
Speaker 4:  got the gunfire scent.

216
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,125
Speaker 10:  Oh this is a new Smell.

217
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:02,325
Speaker 10:  It's very smoky Smell.

218
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:07,725
Speaker 4:  So overall it does work. I also played this with Animal Crossing.

219
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:11,125
Speaker 4:  I know these are probably not the best case scenarios, but they said you

220
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,805
Speaker 4:  could use it with anything. Yeah, I got the forest sent immediately

221
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:18,325
Speaker 4:  when I was in animal crossing on my island. I have a lot of trees. So

222
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:20,285
Speaker 4:  overall it does kind work. Does

223
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:24,165
Speaker 3:  It add anything though? Like does it, do you feel like it made Mario

224
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:27,765
Speaker 3:  Kart more exciting or immersive to have this working?

225
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:32,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I don't think so. I think maybe if I'm

226
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:36,085
Speaker 4:  using it longer over time and I'm not noticing it, like

227
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:40,085
Speaker 4:  if I crashed horribly in Mario Kart, I Smell

228
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:44,045
Speaker 4:  that burning tire scent, it might be a little bit more powerful. Also,

229
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:47,125
Speaker 4:  you kind of have to have the atomized fairly close to you to like

230
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:51,325
Speaker 4:  immediately Smell it when it happens. If you put it a little

231
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:55,165
Speaker 4:  too far away from you, it might take a bit for the scent to come up,

232
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:59,805
Speaker 4:  but if it's more experiential environment thing, you may

233
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:03,405
Speaker 4:  not change scents very often. Like if you're in a forest

234
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,965
Speaker 4:  in in Zelda or something, you're probably there for a long time.

235
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:11,525
Speaker 4:  But I, I'm not sure if it's all there yet. Like I'm not

236
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:13,285
Speaker 4:  more immersed in Mario Carr.

237
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,885
Speaker 3:  Well I, I kind of, I have sort of two theories about that. One is that maybe

238
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:21,285
Speaker 3:  the problem is just that Smell doesn't work like sound does. Like it sort

239
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:24,645
Speaker 3:  of sounds like you're saying like what if the soundtrack of the movie

240
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:28,965
Speaker 3:  just played constantly for an hour and I was like well it wouldn't do anything.

241
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:32,765
Speaker 3:  Right. The fact that you can play music at specific points that does

242
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:36,125
Speaker 3:  specific things is actually really powerful in a way that just diffusing

243
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:40,005
Speaker 3:  oil into the air. You just don't have that kind of control. Right. But also

244
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,445
Speaker 3:  then I'm like, what if there were just way more smells? What if instead of

245
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:47,245
Speaker 3:  six it was like 6,000 and it could be like small explosion,

246
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:51,565
Speaker 3:  big explosion, you're dying in the explosion. Like maybe,

247
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,965
Speaker 3:  maybe we just, instead of doing less of this, we need to do much, much, much

248
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:55,485
Speaker 3:  more of it.

249
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:59,325
Speaker 4:  That's what I think. I think 6 cents are not enough and

250
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,805
Speaker 4:  technically it's five because there's like the neutralizing odor, right.

251
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:06,645
Speaker 4:  So I don't think it's there's enough yet for a full immersive

252
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:10,885
Speaker 4:  experience. But I talked to the people at games sent, they

253
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:14,685
Speaker 4:  were experimenting with Daisy chaing a bunch of these. Oh. So

254
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:17,925
Speaker 4:  you can buy a bunch and maybe put, you know, multiples of

255
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:21,245
Speaker 4:  6 cents in your gaming setup. So

256
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:24,325
Speaker 3:  Like forest plus gunshot equals

257
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:26,485
Speaker 3:  war, I dunno. Yeah.

258
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:31,205
Speaker 4:  Oh totally. Yeah. And they do plan on adding more scents to swap

259
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:34,845
Speaker 4:  out Right now on the website it says there will be a

260
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:38,845
Speaker 4:  ocean scent. Okay. A sports arena scent, fresh cut

261
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:42,725
Speaker 4:  grass. There's a zombie Smell that's gonna be coming. That's

262
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:43,605
Speaker 4:  what they told me.

263
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:47,605
Speaker 3:  This is my new favorite job in the tech industry that I am

264
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:51,405
Speaker 3:  desperate to know much more about is the, the Smell designers for video

265
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:54,325
Speaker 3:  games. Yeah, that's a, that's a life goal right there. Yeah.

266
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:58,245
Speaker 4:  They work with a third party company to like design these custom scents

267
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:01,645
Speaker 4:  for the game scent. So it's not just these stock ones that they just buy,

268
00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:05,605
Speaker 4:  you know, but I would love for them to make like a bundle for certain

269
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:09,525
Speaker 4:  games. Mm. If there was like a Mario Kart bundle, I could have a

270
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:13,245
Speaker 4:  racing car scent and like a banana scent for the banana peel

271
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:17,685
Speaker 4:  in the game. Yeah. And then an ink Smell for when you get blooper. That would

272
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:21,045
Speaker 4:  be cool. And you could, you know, have different packs for different games.

273
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:25,325
Speaker 3:  That's a really fun idea. You, you buy the $70 game and for

274
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:29,245
Speaker 3:  15 more dollars you get all the game smells. Yeah. I like weirdly

275
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:30,045
Speaker 3:  feel like that would work.

276
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:33,765
Speaker 4:  I think so too. And I talked to the president of the company and the VP of

277
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:37,605
Speaker 4:  marketing at the company about this and they like want to work

278
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:41,165
Speaker 4:  with companies in movie production houses to make

279
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:44,565
Speaker 4:  customs sense for games and movies. They said they would love to partner

280
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:48,365
Speaker 4:  with like Dune and figure out what the spice smells like in

281
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:49,085
Speaker 4:  Dune. You know, know.

282
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:51,285
Speaker 3:  Oh that's, that's very compelling.

283
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:55,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So David, would you use something like this

284
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:57,365
Speaker 4:  for movies or games? I

285
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:01,285
Speaker 3:  Think games I actually find more interesting than movies and

286
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:04,325
Speaker 3:  I think actually your spice example is sort of the perfect one where to me

287
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:08,205
Speaker 3:  the idea of having like lots of different smells

288
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:11,845
Speaker 3:  kind of coming and going as you play a game or watch a movie is probably

289
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:14,925
Speaker 3:  just too hard to pull off. Like just because of what you're talking about.

290
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:18,765
Speaker 3:  Like it has to diffuse oil into the air at a particular time.

291
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:21,725
Speaker 3:  But if I could sit down to play Dune and it just kind of smelled a little

292
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:25,405
Speaker 3:  like spice, it's like, you know how when the room smells like popcorn,

293
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:28,565
Speaker 3:  like every movie's a little more enjoyable. Like it's just that little thing

294
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,405
Speaker 3:  that if I could just kind of, or the thing people do where they like sync

295
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:34,925
Speaker 3:  up the lights to the movie. Yeah. Just having that one little

296
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:38,885
Speaker 3:  additional thing where instead of having everything

297
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:42,605
Speaker 3:  on screen have a Smell, you can just sort of have the game, have a Smell

298
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:46,325
Speaker 3:  or like the world like the, you mentioned the fresh cut grass thing

299
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:50,285
Speaker 3:  and like I play a lot of FIFA and the idea of having that where I can

300
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:53,965
Speaker 3:  sort of feel like I'm on a pitch even though I can't Smell the sweaty dude

301
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,925
Speaker 3:  next to me, it just kind of smells like I'm on a soccer field. Yeah. That

302
00:18:56,925 --> 00:19:00,165
Speaker 3:  kind of does something for me and feels maybe slightly more achievable. I'm

303
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:03,965
Speaker 3:  just not convinced that the like soundtrack a game with smells thing is

304
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:07,805
Speaker 3:  even technically possible. Mm. But I hope I'm wrong. Like I, I,

305
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:10,445
Speaker 3:  I love the idea. I think it's great that people have been working on this

306
00:19:10,445 --> 00:19:13,805
Speaker 3:  for like what, 50 years now. I think it'd be awesome if it worked. I'm just

307
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:14,525
Speaker 3:  not convinced it will.

308
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,845
Speaker 4:  Like even in that movie I mentioned the Scent of Mystery, there was like

309
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:22,645
Speaker 4:  a point where it will deploy a perfume scent of

310
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:26,525
Speaker 4:  one of the characters that was off screen and so you knew this character

311
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:30,125
Speaker 4:  was about to come in Oh kind of thing. So there's like a storytelling aspect

312
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,045
Speaker 4:  to it Yeah. That you could totally take advantage of. I

313
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:36,045
Speaker 3:  Love that you can, you can Smell the bad guy before the bad guy appears on

314
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:36,525
Speaker 3:  screen. Oh

315
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:39,445
Speaker 4:  Totally. Yeah. This is great for shadowing. It really is.

316
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:44,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I, I want one, I'm, I'm like this thing is on Amazon, which is a real

317
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:47,525
Speaker 3:  problem because I'm now tempted to buy it just because of the sheer sort

318
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:50,885
Speaker 3:  of delightful silliness of the whole thing. Are you gonna keep using yours

319
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:53,965
Speaker 3:  now that you don't have to for The Vergecast anymore? Do you think it'll

320
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:55,005
Speaker 3:  still stay hooked up to the switch?

321
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:59,565
Speaker 4:  Probably not until they get new Cent. I think it's

322
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:03,485
Speaker 4:  pretty strong overall and after a while it's like eh, I actually don't

323
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:07,205
Speaker 4:  wanna Smell this forest Smell. A lot of it's very perfumey

324
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:07,845
Speaker 4:  so far

325
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:11,165
Speaker 3:  Have it, has it lingered in your apartment? Like do you come home and you're

326
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:13,005
Speaker 3:  like hmm, smells like burnt tires?

327
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:17,565
Speaker 4:  Well the box does the box with all the oils still

328
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:18,245
Speaker 4:  inside it.

329
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:48,725
Speaker 3:  so excited. We'll be right

330
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:58,485
Speaker 3:  It's time for maybe the weirdest sense in the five senses of video games.

331
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:03,125
Speaker 3:  Taste Andrew. It turns out Smell has a decades long

332
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,765
Speaker 3:  history in movies and video games. Does taste,

333
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,845
Speaker 3:  have there been people trying to make you taste video games since the seventies?

334
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:15,245
Speaker 4:  Well so the first time we started talking about this, I

335
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:19,245
Speaker 4:  remembered this 2017 podcast we did. Our colleague

336
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:23,285
Speaker 4:  Addie Robertson interviewed Jaron Lanier who you know is

337
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:27,205
Speaker 4:  a pioneer in that first phase of VR from the eighties and nineties.

338
00:22:27,705 --> 00:22:31,285
Speaker 4:  At the time he was promoting a book and in the book he mentioned this VR

339
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:35,245
Speaker 4:  taste simulator he tried from a Japanese company and then he

340
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:36,245
Speaker 4:  talked about it on the podcast

341
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:40,925
Speaker 11:  The next time was Japan. I tried this crazy thing and it was really

342
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:44,205
Speaker 11:  hard to sterilize between users and really hard to initialize and really

343
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:48,325
Speaker 11:  crazy. But it was like this weird little morphing robot with little

344
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:51,325
Speaker 11:  chemical squirters and you would stick it in your mouth and start chewing

345
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:51,645
Speaker 11:  on it.

346
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:55,765
Speaker 12:  Wait, did it just look like a blob, like a little blob robot?

347
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:59,925
Speaker 11:  It was like this rubber thing with all these little robotic effectors inside

348
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:03,645
Speaker 11:  it that could collapse or move and then it had like these little nozzles

349
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:07,125
Speaker 11:  that would squirt flavors out of little holes in it. Yeah, I

350
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,285
Speaker 12:  Know that sounds really disgusting.

351
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,765
Speaker 11:  It it absolutely the most repulsive user interface item I have ever seen

352
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:17,325
Speaker 3:  A heck of a sales pitch BI agree. That does sound sort

353
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:17,925
Speaker 3:  of disgusting.

354
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:18,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

355
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:22,445
Speaker 4:  That is bizarre. I, I would love to have seen what that looks like or I

356
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,765
Speaker 4:  would love to try it honestly. But you can imagine like something like that

357
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:30,205
Speaker 4:  is very hard to emulate taste putting something in your

358
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:33,965
Speaker 4:  mouth. I haven't seen anything remotely close to what he was talking

359
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:37,325
Speaker 4:  about there, but I did find someone who is working on

360
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:40,525
Speaker 4:  something in the world of taste simulation.

361
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:44,885
Speaker 13:  I'm Nisha Inger, I'm an assistant professor at

362
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:48,965
Speaker 13:  University of Maine in the School of Computing and information science.

363
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:53,405
Speaker 4:  So I talked to Naisha, he was previously in this

364
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:57,885
Speaker 4:  research group at the University of Singapore focusing on human

365
00:23:57,885 --> 00:24:01,565
Speaker 4:  interaction and virtual reality and he specifically was

366
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,165
Speaker 4:  interested in incorporating taste sensation and simulation

367
00:24:05,435 --> 00:24:09,245
Speaker 4:  into this. So the best way that he was figuring it out

368
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:13,325
Speaker 4:  was through controlling electrical currents and electrical

369
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:16,725
Speaker 4:  pulses onto your tongue to give different taste

370
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:20,805
Speaker 4:  sensations. So like, you know, If, you lick a battery If,

371
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:24,685
Speaker 4:  you've ever done that? Sure. It's like kind of like a so kind of

372
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,725
Speaker 4:  sharp taste. So he built on that idea.

373
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:31,965
Speaker 13:  So I thought like maybe we can focus on that and we can fine

374
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:35,885
Speaker 13:  tune the electrical stimuli, like reduce it to very, very, very low

375
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:39,685
Speaker 13:  electric current around like a hundred micro amia and then

376
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:43,805
Speaker 13:  start studying like when we change the electric current

377
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:47,885
Speaker 13:  and the frequency as well as the different areas of the

378
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:51,205
Speaker 13:  tongue when we stimulate how we can sort of

379
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:55,365
Speaker 13:  relate those electric stimuli like perception into

380
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:59,245
Speaker 13:  like actual basic taste perceptions like salty, sour,

381
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:02,165
Speaker 13:  sweet and bitter sensations. Mainly,

382
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:06,525
Speaker 4:  You know, different currents attacking your tongue, maybe

383
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:10,645
Speaker 4:  changing the temperature to make it hot or cold for like a spic or minty

384
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:12,365
Speaker 4:  feeling. You know, I had

385
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:15,885
Speaker 3:  No idea this was like understood science that you could

386
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:19,885
Speaker 3:  essentially push a taste onto someone's tongue

387
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:22,885
Speaker 3:  with electrical currents. I guess I'm, I shouldn't be surprised by this,

388
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:25,445
Speaker 3:  but that's very cool to have just learned about just now.

389
00:25:25,635 --> 00:25:29,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's pretty wild. Apparently it works. There was an early

390
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:33,005
Speaker 4:  prototype they worked on that was like a 3D printed spoon with

391
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:36,525
Speaker 4:  electronics inside it and it little electrodes underneath the spoon

392
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:40,125
Speaker 4:  so when you put it on your tongue it would like zap these

393
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,925
Speaker 4:  sensations. Whoa.

394
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:46,285
Speaker 3:  So you, you bite the spoon and it, it's like cinnamon toast crunch

395
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:50,445
Speaker 3:  and then you bite the spoon again and it's like spaghetti.

396
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:54,365
Speaker 4:  I don't know if it was that advanced. Okay. But it was like, oh maybe this

397
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:58,445
Speaker 4:  tastes salty now this fair enough is super sweet. You know they also

398
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:02,165
Speaker 4:  had like metal chopsticks they worked on that was like a plus and minus kind

399
00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:06,085
Speaker 4:  of a circuit. Whoa. They tried a soup bowl, all these

400
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:09,685
Speaker 4:  things. They wanted to make sure it all represented stuff that people were

401
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:12,285
Speaker 4:  already used to putting in their mouth. Sure.

402
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:16,485
Speaker 13:  We wanted to see like a, a range of different food items and

403
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:20,365
Speaker 13:  like a semi-liquid kind of food items like porridge and soaps

404
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,405
Speaker 13:  and how we can sort of augment the flavors based on the

405
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:25,565
Speaker 13:  electrical stimulation.

406
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:29,845
Speaker 4:  So that kind of thing. Only manipulates primary tastes. Sensations like you

407
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:33,725
Speaker 4:  mentioned salty sour. They also realized that individual

408
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:37,965
Speaker 4:  senses influence each other so that can be a powerful tool. They

409
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:41,925
Speaker 4:  started adding like Smell to give a more immersive experience in this

410
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:45,525
Speaker 4:  drinking machine. Much like the game scent, you could engage

411
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:49,605
Speaker 4:  food and drink smells in, which totally influences the way you

412
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:53,405
Speaker 4:  taste. And then also they want to incorporate sight. So they're

413
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:54,485
Speaker 4:  experimenting with color

414
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:58,485
Speaker 13:  If, you go to a bar, they have these like beautiful like range of colors,

415
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:02,845
Speaker 13:  cocktails and yeah, each and every color sort of gives us like some kind

416
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:06,405
Speaker 13:  of like a pre sort of conceive or like an idea like

417
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,805
Speaker 13:  this is going to be sweeter, this is going to be sour, this is going to

418
00:27:09,805 --> 00:27:13,645
Speaker 13:  be sweet and sour and bitter. Kind of like a some idea, right? Based on

419
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:17,365
Speaker 13:  the look and feel or based on our previous experiences. So we

420
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:21,325
Speaker 13:  wanted to expand on that idea and then see like

421
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:25,405
Speaker 13:  how we can create the same beverage but add the colors

422
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:29,405
Speaker 13:  and taste and Smell using the digital controls to see whether

423
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:31,765
Speaker 13:  we can change the people's perception.

424
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:35,765
Speaker 4:  So all that idea was made into this invention called the

425
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:37,165
Speaker 4:  virtual cocktail.

426
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:41,805
Speaker 13:  So we got like a traditional martini glass and then 3D print like a structure,

427
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:46,125
Speaker 13:  attach the glass and then we, we also had a electronic control

428
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,965
Speaker 13:  system and then like a tree Smell chambers and then three like

429
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:53,845
Speaker 13:  air pumps, like the air pumps we use in like fish tanks, like the tiny

430
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:57,725
Speaker 13:  micro air pumps. We put them inside and then we can release like

431
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:01,605
Speaker 13:  three different smells on top of the beverage surface. And then

432
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:05,445
Speaker 13:  on the rim, instead of putting like like a margarita, like a salt

433
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:09,445
Speaker 13:  or sugar, we put those electrodes and then now we can simulate the

434
00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:13,525
Speaker 13:  ness of saltiness using the electrodes. And then we also put like

435
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:17,085
Speaker 13:  A-R-G-B-L-E-D to change the colorful beverage.

436
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:21,285
Speaker 4:  So adding all that stuff together like actually changed the way

437
00:28:21,745 --> 00:28:25,125
Speaker 4:  you would taste this drink that was ba you know, it would just be water,

438
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:25,885
Speaker 4:  you know? Yeah.

439
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:29,925
Speaker 3:  That also sounds like an incredible gaming accessory. I

440
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:33,445
Speaker 3:  feel like he just describes something that I now want every time I do anything.

441
00:28:33,915 --> 00:28:34,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

442
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:38,325
Speaker 4:  I can imagine like in Fortnite you're going to a bar in Fortnite and

443
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:42,205
Speaker 4:  you're having like this in real life electronic Tumblr of water

444
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:46,245
Speaker 4:  and then you sip it and it sinks with the game. Like whatever you're tasting,

445
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:47,885
Speaker 4:  I don't know. Yeah. Like

446
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:51,845
Speaker 3:  The mead you drink in like a medieval game actually tastes like meat is you're

447
00:28:51,885 --> 00:28:54,565
Speaker 3:  drinking it. I want this so bad Andrew. That sounds awesome.

448
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:59,085
Speaker 3:  Is this a real thing? Did they actually, like they made one of these, it

449
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,165
Speaker 3:  sounds like, is this a real thing?

450
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:04,365
Speaker 4:  They demoed it at a virtual reality showcase a few years ago in London.

451
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:08,165
Speaker 4:  It was really popular. A lot of people wrote about it. The Mesha said that

452
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:11,765
Speaker 4:  they spun off the research into another company that is actively working

453
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:14,365
Speaker 4:  on this thing with the spoon version as well.

454
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:15,325
Speaker 3:  That's very exciting.

455
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:19,045
Speaker 4:  There's also like another aspect of this that is outside of games.

456
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:23,525
Speaker 4:  So like If, you wanna watch the sodium or the sugar

457
00:29:23,585 --> 00:29:27,405
Speaker 4:  intake in your diet. You can kinda like, you know, have a spoon with

458
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:31,285
Speaker 4:  oatmeal and like artificially add salt with the

459
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:35,365
Speaker 4:  spoon electronics. So it's like, oh now this is a little saltier even though

460
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:39,365
Speaker 4:  I'm not adding any salt. And then also just communicating another

461
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:41,325
Speaker 4:  form of sense to someone.

462
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:45,765
Speaker 13:  How can we think of like these devices as communication devices?

463
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:49,645
Speaker 13:  So communication media for example. Like how many times we go to like

464
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:53,605
Speaker 13:  some other place or some other like the restaurant and wondering like how

465
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,605
Speaker 13:  can we send this sort of flavor or like the dish to my

466
00:29:57,735 --> 00:30:01,645
Speaker 13:  girlfriend or my wife or like my parents or my sister or

467
00:30:01,645 --> 00:30:05,445
Speaker 13:  brother just for them to try. One of the sort of vision I have

468
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:09,445
Speaker 13:  is also like create kind of like a flavor social media, how

469
00:30:09,465 --> 00:30:13,165
Speaker 13:  can we share flavors? And I mean we do these kind of things

470
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:16,525
Speaker 13:  every day. Like we take photos and try to upload them into social media

471
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:20,365
Speaker 13:  and explain things verbally. One of the questions I asked is,

472
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:24,245
Speaker 13:  can we do this in virtual reality environment with these kind of tools

473
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:28,205
Speaker 13:  integrated so that you will get like a much more believable sort

474
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:31,925
Speaker 13:  of being there sensation plus these taste and

475
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:35,045
Speaker 13:  Smell sensations to sort of complete experience.

476
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,765
Speaker 3:  That sounds very cool. You know what it makes me think of is I had a conversation

477
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:42,645
Speaker 3:  with Eric Yuan, the CEO of Zoom maybe six

478
00:30:42,645 --> 00:30:45,645
Speaker 3:  months into the pandemic. So this is like four years ago now. And I was talking

479
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:49,125
Speaker 3:  to Eric like, okay, what's next? We're all doing this now but we're all rectangles.

480
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:52,125
Speaker 3:  And he had a bunch of ideas but then he was like, what I want to have happen

481
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:56,365
Speaker 3:  is I want be able to have a cup of coffee and share it with you

482
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,645
Speaker 3:  on Zoom. And I remember having this idea of being like, that is the most

483
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,685
Speaker 3:  bananas thing I have ever heard in my entire life. But also very

484
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:06,565
Speaker 3:  cool and I feel like this is, this is how you do it, right? Like this is

485
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:10,285
Speaker 3:  that same kind of thing. We've gone way past gaming here. Yeah. But I think

486
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,085
Speaker 3:  that's a, that's a really cool, interesting

487
00:31:14,045 --> 00:31:16,925
Speaker 3:  scientific way of approaching that idea of like, how do you and I actually

488
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:20,845
Speaker 3:  share virtual experiences. Maybe he's not wrong. That between Smell

489
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,205
Speaker 3:  and Taste, you actually get a pretty long way doing that.

490
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:27,045
Speaker 4:  I know. I would love to just email you a lemonade to,

491
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:31,125
Speaker 4:  I could sell up a lemonade stand and I could email you the

492
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:33,045
Speaker 4:  the drink open

493
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:35,085
Speaker 3:  The email bite the spoon Lemonade.

494
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:36,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

495
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:40,165
Speaker 3:  I don't know if that's Utopia or dystopia, but I'm gonna be thinking about

496
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,325
Speaker 3:  that for a really long time.

497
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:45,205
Speaker 4:  All this stuff seems kind of silly, but when you think about the future of

498
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:49,125
Speaker 4:  all this, when gaming becomes more immersive, there might be

499
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:52,925
Speaker 4:  a point where the only thing that really pulls you out of that immersion

500
00:31:53,065 --> 00:31:57,005
Speaker 4:  is like, oh, why doesn't this bar Smell like stale beer?

501
00:31:57,065 --> 00:32:00,765
Speaker 4:  Or why don't I feel any sensation when I'm

502
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:04,725
Speaker 4:  restoring my hunger points and Minecraft? Do you think maybe this

503
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:07,845
Speaker 4:  stuff is just inevitable in video games once we get more immersive?

504
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:12,445
Speaker 3:  I I sort of buy the argument honestly. I think to me the first

505
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:16,525
Speaker 3:  thing we have to solve, and it's gonna take a really long time, is the haptic

506
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:19,245
Speaker 3:  stuff, right? Where I feel like where we are now is the thing that takes

507
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:23,085
Speaker 3:  you out of it almost is no longer the graphics. Like I feel like with the

508
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:26,405
Speaker 3:  Vision Pro and even sort of the Quest three, your brain is in the place that

509
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:30,325
Speaker 3:  you are pretty successfully, but then you reach out and touch something

510
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:33,605
Speaker 3:  and there's no sensation of actually touching the thing. Or when you move

511
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:37,645
Speaker 3:  it's obvious that you're not in the game moving. So I really do sort of

512
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:40,460
Speaker 3:  sincerely believe that someday when we wanna play video games, we're gonna

513
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,525
Speaker 3:  have to put on like full body haptic suits and I'm actually fine with that

514
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:46,765
Speaker 3:  future. I think it's gonna be awesome. Like put on your wetsuit, put on your

515
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:50,645
Speaker 3:  headset and like go play Call of Duty. That's a world I'm very excited to

516
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:53,165
Speaker 3:  live in. But I think you're probably right that if and when we solve that

517
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:56,965
Speaker 3:  problem, the next thing will be, well this still doesn't feel like

518
00:32:57,425 --> 00:33:01,245
Speaker 3:  I'm grabbing anything because all of my other sensations are not there.

519
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,525
Speaker 3:  Right. We will have solved sight, we will have solved hearing and we will

520
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:08,085
Speaker 3:  have solved touch. And then there's two left and like as you know, you've

521
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:10,405
Speaker 3:  been talking about kind of through this whole segment, like it's the way

522
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,725
Speaker 3:  that those senses work together that makes them powerful.

523
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:17,965
Speaker 3:  And also like I'm, as I'm thinking about this now, the idea that

524
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:22,285
Speaker 3:  Smell could work in my headset actually seems like maybe it solves a bunch

525
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:25,365
Speaker 3:  of problems that having to work in my living room doesn't Yeah.

526
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:27,965
Speaker 4:  When you got this thing right up to your face anyway.

527
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:32,085
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So I think like, I don't know, I'm, I, this all feels like maybe

528
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:35,445
Speaker 3:  it's like a 50 year problem and will have much bigger things to deal with

529
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,285
Speaker 3:  than, than Smell. But I can sort of see why people

530
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:40,645
Speaker 3:  continue to care about this.

531
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:45,165
Speaker 4:  I'm imagining like a whole helmet that has like a straw you sipping and

532
00:33:45,235 --> 00:33:47,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah. A thing that goes on your nose and the GOs

533
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:51,285
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's the combination of like the two beers on the side of your, on

534
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:55,085
Speaker 3:  the side of your head in the hat and a camelback that goes to your mouth

535
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:59,165
Speaker 3:  and like a, a motorcycle helmet that you're essentially just hotboxing with

536
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:02,045
Speaker 3:  different smells all the time. Yeah. And that's just, that's how you play

537
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:02,845
Speaker 3:  Animal Crossing.

538
00:34:03,195 --> 00:34:05,645
Speaker 4:  Exactly. It's a future I would love to live in.

539
00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:10,125
Speaker 3:  This sounds great. Apple, if you're listening, this is how you make the vision

540
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:12,965
Speaker 3:  Pro a success. We, Andrew and I just figured it out. We did it.

541
00:34:13,235 --> 00:34:13,965
Speaker 4:  Make it stink.

542
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:19,645
Speaker 3:  All right Andrew, you did better on this project than I expected anyone

543
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:23,765
Speaker 3:  possibly could. This is very fun. Oh thanks. Thank you for going on these

544
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:25,125
Speaker 3:  bizarre adventures for us. Oh

545
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:26,245
Speaker 4:  It was so fun. Good.

546
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:29,245
Speaker 3:  Alright, we should get outta here. That is it for The. Vergecast thank you
