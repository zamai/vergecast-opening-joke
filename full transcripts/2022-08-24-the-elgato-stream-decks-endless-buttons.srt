00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,630
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast the flagship podcast of mappable buttons. I'm your

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,900
Speaker 2:  friend, David Pierce. And I am standing on my back patio in front of the

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,870
Speaker 2:  grill. I just bought it's a weird time to buy a grill right before the end

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,200
Speaker 2:  of the summer. But I did it anyway because it was on sale. And because this

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,190
Speaker 2:  grill, the Weber spirit III three 10 is the one

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,000
Speaker 2:  everybody told me to buy. So I bought it. I like it so far, but the best

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,280
Speaker 2:  thing about this grill is this button

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,030
Speaker 2:  Ignition, which turns on all the burners all at once. I find myself

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,020
Speaker 2:  yelling, I have created fire every single time I turn it on. It

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,010
Speaker 2:  just feels powerful. You know, today's whole episode is

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,250
Speaker 2:  about buttons. We're going to spend the whole show talking about the stream

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,090
Speaker 2:  deck, not the game console, the steam deck, but the stream deck from El Gato,

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,750
Speaker 2:  which is a desk accessory that is basically just a bunch of buttons. And

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,410
Speaker 2:  it turns out a bunch of buttons is a pretty seriously powerful thing.

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,530
Speaker 2:  We're going to hear how people use their stream deck, how to hack it, to

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,520
Speaker 2:  do even more and how to turn your old devices into something kind of like

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,240
Speaker 2:  it. But first let me finish these burgers that I came out here to grill

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,780
Speaker 2:  buttons are good and silver burgers. That's the takeaway. This is the, Vergecast

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,020
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So like I mentioned a minute ago, this whole episode is going

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,840
Speaker 2:  to be about a single device. The El Gato stream deck.

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,880
Speaker 2:  If you've never seen one, it's basically just a panel of buttons, each

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,870
Speaker 2:  one with a small square screen inside. It's about as wide as my thumb

44
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,830
Speaker 2:  and you can customize it however you want. It's like having a teeny tiny

45
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,370
Speaker 2:  control panel for your computer. Like you're sitting in a music studio at

46
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,910
Speaker 2:  one of those huge mixing boards except much less chaotic.

47
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,080
Speaker 2:  The stream deck is a pretty niche thing. It was built mostly for people

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,020
Speaker 2:  who live stream on Twitch or platforms like that. And thus need to

49
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,560
Speaker 2:  switch between cameras and streaming software and manage comment threads

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,310
Speaker 2:  all simultaneously without spending all their time, staring down at their

51
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,180
Speaker 2:  keyboards. It has big, bright buttons that you can feel and press.

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,690
Speaker 2:  And that goes a long way towards helping that you see tons of Twitch streamers

53
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,390
Speaker 2:  actually using stream decks. They're really good for that. But the stream

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,050
Speaker 2:  deck is actually much more than just a streaming thing because it's

55
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,590
Speaker 2:  just a big blank slate of buttons. It's also one of the

56
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,130
Speaker 2:  most fun hacker friendly tinker rubble

57
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,760
Speaker 2:  things you're ever going to find. You can program it to do almost

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,390
Speaker 2:  anything, which is in a way both a little overwhelming to think about

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,500
Speaker 2:  and just incredibly fun. There's nothing it can do that you couldn't

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,130
Speaker 2:  technically do with your mouse or keyboard or game controller. That's definitely

61
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,000
Speaker 2:  true, but the stream deck takes all kinds of complicated computer

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,480
Speaker 2:  stuff and just turns it into a button. And if there's one thing you should

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,020
Speaker 2:  know about us here on the Vergecast it's that we believe in buttons,

64
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,740
Speaker 2:  screens are great, but they're complicated. Software is great, but it's

65
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,640
Speaker 2:  often badly designed and hard to figure out, but buttons, buttons,

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,240
Speaker 2:  everybody can figure out. So really what this episode is

67
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,110
Speaker 2:  actually about is buttons and how a bunch of people we know and like

68
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,980
Speaker 2:  are finding ways to put more buttons back into their lives because computers

69
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,940
Speaker 2:  are complicated and buttons are not. We're going to get deep into the weeds

70
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,480
Speaker 2:  on how people use their stream deck and all these buttons. But let me just

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,290
Speaker 2:  give you a few examples from my own stream deck. I have one button on mine.

72
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,470
Speaker 2:  That's connected to the lamp in my home office and just turns it on and off

73
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,950
Speaker 2:  super helpful. I have one that mutes or unmutes my computer. So I don't have

74
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,190
Speaker 2:  to find the button on my keyboard. Every time I have a page full of buttons

75
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,030
Speaker 2:  that just open links to Google drive to the app, we use to record this podcast

76
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,270
Speaker 2:  to my calendar app, to a bunch of other stuff. I have a bunch of buttons

77
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,510
Speaker 2:  linked to Spotify playlist so I can start playing what I want without even

78
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,500
Speaker 2:  having to open the app. None of these things you might note are for

79
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,430
Speaker 2:  live streaming. The stuff that the stream deck is sensibly meant for it's

80
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,330
Speaker 2:  just useful in my life. I have six buttons on my stream deck mini, but

81
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,510
Speaker 2:  they can be a thousand different things. And I'm really only scratching the

82
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,050
Speaker 2:  surface,

83
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,260
Speaker 2:  But enough about me let's get into the show. The first thing we did was ask

84
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,890
Speaker 2:  a bunch of verge staffers, how they use their own stream decks to see what

85
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,640
Speaker 2:  kind of tips we could get from our own team. We got a lot of good stuff.

86
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,740
Speaker 2:  Let's start with Shawn Hollister.

87
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,790
Speaker 6:  I'm a senior editor at the verge in charge of finding gadgets.

88
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,510
Speaker 2:  Sean has the stream deck mini, which is what I have the one with six buttons.

89
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,260
Speaker 6:  First thing I've got right here is I have a button that will allow me to

90
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,160
Speaker 6:  dim my entire rooms lights because I have homocysteine and hooked up to the

91
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,610
Speaker 6:  stream deck. And so I can go dim. I can go bright. I can be like, oh, I don't

92
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,520
Speaker 6:  want any of that background light when I'm in the middle of the night playing

93
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,480
Speaker 6:  games, that's perfect. Then I have a Berge button that will immediately

94
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,290
Speaker 6:  pop up the verge.com because why wouldn't you do that? Then I

95
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,070
Speaker 6:  have a button that will allow me to not only shut down my computer,

96
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,180
Speaker 6:  but toss it into sleep mode or reboot it or lock it. It's great. The

97
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,740
Speaker 6:  fan will stop running. The lights will turn

98
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,760
Speaker 7:  Off. Cause I got a button right there that does it.

99
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,690
Speaker 2:  Dan Siefert deputy editor at the verge also has a stream deck mini.

100
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,040
Speaker 8:  The story is I bought the big one that has like 30 something buttons on

101
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Speaker 8:  it. And then I realized I don't have 30 something things that do with this.

102
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,750
Speaker 8:  And it takes away too much room on my desk. So I returned it and I went

103
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,580
Speaker 8:  all the way down to the six button. One,

104
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,510
Speaker 2:  Dan actually wrote a while back about how he uses his stream deck.

105
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,530
Speaker 2:  And that story convinced a bunch of other people on staff to buy one.

106
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,430
Speaker 8:  I only ever use it for zoom. And what I do with zoom

107
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,660
Speaker 8:  is there's a zoom plugin for the stream deck. And you can program

108
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,500
Speaker 8:  buttons on there to mute, to turn your camera on and off

109
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,340
Speaker 8:  to bring the zoom window forward. So like if you've

110
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,060
Speaker 8:  clicked off of it and then your boss is like, oh, Hey Dan, what do you think

111
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,880
Speaker 8:  about this? You click that button and boom, the zoom windows right in front

112
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,570
Speaker 8:  of you again. And then I've got a shortcut that runs with Mac

113
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,680
Speaker 8:  S to join my next zoom meeting. But the most powerful button

114
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,850
Speaker 8:  is the leave zoom button, which allows

115
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,810
Speaker 8:  me to just push a button and I leave the meeting and I never have to like

116
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,470
Speaker 8:  struggle with my mouse to find the leave meeting button and then click the

117
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,540
Speaker 8:  little agree window that pops up or whatever

118
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,080
Speaker 2:  You avoid the awkward five seconds. Let's all sort of wave at each other

119
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,880
Speaker 2:  while we look for buttons on the thing.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,500
Speaker 8:  Yes. I just mashed the button and the icon is a little running man. Like

121
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,010
Speaker 8:  he's just running away from the meeting.

122
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,270
Speaker 2:  The fact that the stream decks buttons are also teeny tiny screens makes

123
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,260
Speaker 2:  this even better.

124
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,560
Speaker 8:  So when you are muted, you've got a little line through the microphone, but

125
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Speaker 8:  if you push the button, you'll know that your bike is live. And so, you know,

126
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,970
Speaker 8:  don't say bad things about your boss.

127
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,660
Speaker 2:  Are there versions of this for other conferencing systems? We obviously use

128
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,800
Speaker 2:  zoom. Is there a thing for others?

129
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,980
Speaker 8:  Don't believe there's one for teams. I've not really been able to find one

130
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,160
Speaker 8:  for teams surprise. We know there's not one for WebEx. We just kind of

131
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,510
Speaker 8:  assume there's not, but there is a plugin for Google meet. Okay.

132
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,650
Speaker 8:  So I've got a folder for Google meet on my little stream deck. That's

133
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,590
Speaker 8:  like four pages down. And because we rarely use me at the verge, but when

134
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,220
Speaker 8:  I do need to use it, it does basically the same things. It's got a mute button,

135
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,120
Speaker 8:  a video button, a hang up button, but then it also adds a raise hand

136
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,420
Speaker 8:  button. Cause that's a function that you use a little bit more Google meet

137
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,890
Speaker 2:  Along with the stream deck mini. There is of course the original stream deck,

138
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,400
Speaker 2:  which has 15 hardware buttons that you can customize. What I've learned from

139
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,060
Speaker 2:  this is that I think the 15 button one is the right one, Liam

140
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,580
Speaker 2:  James, the lead producer on the Vergecast has one of those.

141
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,240
Speaker 7:  I cannot imagine how I could possibly fill 32. I'm

142
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,990
Speaker 7:  struggling with 15, but I have just a bit more

143
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,660
Speaker 7:  than what would be comfortable on the six button. One,

144
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,680
Speaker 2:  Liam basically said that in life, as a producer, you tend to do a lot of

145
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,640
Speaker 2:  the same things over and over and over again. So he wanted to automate that

146
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,480
Speaker 2:  clip the stream deck.

147
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,680
Speaker 7:  So I'm making to do items all the time, but they're not always coming

148
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,610
Speaker 7:  from one singular place. So after giving

149
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,570
Speaker 7:  up this idea that two dues need to be titled in a nice way.

150
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,680
Speaker 7:  I found a way to just highlight texts. It doesn't matter where it is

151
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,530
Speaker 7:  and hit a button and it will be added as a new item in my to-do list.

152
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,200
Speaker 7:  That is a huge one. I use it probably 10 times a day.

153
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,100
Speaker 2:  So it copies whatever text it's hovered on, opens up your to-do list app

154
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,450
Speaker 2:  and paste it in as a news ask.

155
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,660
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's actually like, you know, you don't need any add ons software.

156
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,860
Speaker 7:  And my to-do app happens to have a global shortcut. So it's really

157
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,790
Speaker 7:  just a copy and paste job, right? So it's, you know, copy the text, hit the

158
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,720
Speaker 7:  global command paste hit, enter done. I don't even see it. It's

159
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,350
Speaker 7:  so fast.

160
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,710
Speaker 2:  A lot of what he does on the stream deck is essentially activating an app

161
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,370
Speaker 2:  called keyboard Maestro, which allows you to automate almost anything on

162
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,700
Speaker 2:  your Mac with keyboard shortcuts, which also means apparently Liam spends

163
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,790
Speaker 2:  a lot of time sending emails to developers, asking them for more keyboard

164
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,210
Speaker 2:  shortcuts.

165
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,440
Speaker 7:  One of my favorite ones, which is kind of very in the nerdy category

166
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,980
Speaker 7:  is going to my VNC server. I've got a headless Mac that runs

167
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,580
Speaker 7:  Plex what's up, Alex. You know, I would love to have a

168
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,300
Speaker 7:  keyboard shortcut. If you're the developer of screens for, for Mac, please

169
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,080
Speaker 7:  add a keyboard shortcut to go to your favorite VNC server keyboard.

170
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,440
Speaker 7:  Mainstream just does all the hard work and I can hit one button my stream

171
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,980
Speaker 7:  back, and I've got a window open that is showing me what's going on with

172
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,490
Speaker 7:  that Mac

173
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,210
Speaker 2:  Liam also uses the stream deck pretty often for making this show.

174
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,200
Speaker 7:  I do have a kind of like a podcast recording button, which just as a

175
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,650
Speaker 7:  series of things, turns off my air conditioner,

176
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,610
Speaker 7:  Utes, any apps that are going to make noise. It starts

177
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,560
Speaker 7:  a app that has a count up clock to keep you in the lion line,

178
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,860
Speaker 7:  go too long on the segments never works. So it's just kind of like a smart

179
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,900
Speaker 7:  home parlance, like a scene that I have set up.

180
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,270
Speaker 2:  Okay. Now let's talk about the big kahuna. There's the stream deck mini,

181
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,720
Speaker 2:  the regular stream deck, and then the stream deck XL, which has

182
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,560
Speaker 2:  32 hardware buttons. I talked to Alice Newcomb Beal who works on

183
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,310
Speaker 2:  commerce and deals at the verge who has her own stream deck XL. I need to

184
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,350
Speaker 2:  know what all of those buttons are for

185
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,150
Speaker 9:  Honestly, a lot of the passive buttons on here are just kind of

186
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,960
Speaker 9:  mapped to desktop functions because even though I have

187
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,890
Speaker 9:  three separate monitors and tons of windows sprout

188
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,580
Speaker 9:  across that entire real estate, so I can map

189
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,480
Speaker 9:  different buttons to resize and move my windows or just

190
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,350
Speaker 9:  show my desktop really quick. Currently I have one that just allows me to

191
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,220
Speaker 9:  minimize everything and also just empty my recycling bin

192
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,910
Speaker 9:  whenever I need to. And I also have just a

193
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,750
Speaker 9:  clock, basically, just another clock. I only have like

194
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,710
Speaker 9:  four available to me, but I was like, okay, what else am I going to

195
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,590
Speaker 9:  do with this space? All right. I guess I'll put a clock in there. Sure.

196
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,850
Speaker 2:  Alice also has another profile for when she plays destiny, the hugely popular,

197
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,840
Speaker 2:  hugely complicated video game. And that's where the XL really comes into

198
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,540
Speaker 2:  its own filling. All 32 of those buttons,

199
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,770
Speaker 9:  The destiny community has done a lot to kind of fill

200
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,700
Speaker 9:  gaps in quality of life improvements where Bungie

201
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,510
Speaker 9:  may have potentially dropped the ball. And one of those aspects is

202
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,210
Speaker 9:  just in inventory management. Okay, so you have several

203
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,170
Speaker 9:  characters with different load outs and stuff you want to swap

204
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,040
Speaker 9:  between them. And for a long time, you could do that with a

205
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,850
Speaker 9:  browser based app called destiny item manager. Recently that

206
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,540
Speaker 9:  same functionality was brought to the stream deck with an

207
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,500
Speaker 9:  app exclusively for destiny item manager,

208
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,460
Speaker 9:  which allows you to connect your account, connect your

209
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,150
Speaker 9:  destiny account and program different load outs

210
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,110
Speaker 9:  to different buttons. There are some hiccups in the process,

211
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,620
Speaker 9:  but for the most part, if you want to swap between load outs, all you have

212
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,550
Speaker 9:  to do is press a button, which normally would require a lot

213
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,210
Speaker 9:  of moving back and forth within the game.

214
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,930
Speaker 9:  But instead it's been consolidated into just this

215
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,830
Speaker 9:  single input.

216
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,220
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's awesome. And actually kind of a perfect example of what the

217
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,820
Speaker 2:  stream deck I feel like is good for.

218
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,230
Speaker 9:  Yeah, frankly. I was a gassed when I

219
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,550
Speaker 9:  first used that app and just like everything worked. I was like,

220
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,720
Speaker 9:  wow, like that actually works. That's pretty amazing. Part of it

221
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,440
Speaker 9:  too, is just kind of exploring and experimenting with

222
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,430
Speaker 9:  what you can do with the steam deck with these

223
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,060
Speaker 9:  optional macros, you know, like it was with me, it was sitting there just

224
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,960
Speaker 9:  kind of idle for a long time. And then I kind of forced myself

225
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,710
Speaker 9:  to explore the different apps and

226
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,460
Speaker 9:  other functions that you can tie to this device that you keep on your desk.

227
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,710
Speaker 2:  Tom Warren, a senior editor at the verge has a stream deck XL as well.

228
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,550
Speaker 10:  I got it pretty early on and I think the folder support back then. Wasn't

229
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,230
Speaker 10:  great. So that's why I got the giant one.

230
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,710
Speaker 2:  He also uses his stream deck to play games just like Alistair.

231
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,760
Speaker 10:  So I have a button on here that basically is my exports mode. It's when

232
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,610
Speaker 10:  I'm streaming on my exports, it'll have all the stuff where I can like change

233
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,600
Speaker 10:  my lights to green, to match the export sort of brand. I would

234
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,410
Speaker 10:  change all my scenes in OBS to certain export stuff.

235
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,800
Speaker 10:  They don't have a PC one, which is PC focused and all that sort of stuff.

236
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,490
Speaker 10:  So I do the sort of basics there and then I'll have like a switch

237
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,790
Speaker 10:  button where I might press it and I'll be able to press, you know,

238
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,610
Speaker 10:  BRB or live or anything on stream.

239
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,660
Speaker 2:  We also uses it in the most like obvious as intended

240
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,040
Speaker 2:  way as a soundboard.

241
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,060
Speaker 10:  So if I'm hanging out and like discord, I have like a bunch of meme

242
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,730
Speaker 10:  sounds I'll play. When people say so much GPS,

243
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,610
Speaker 2:  Give me an example. What are the most used sounds that we're going to hear

244
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,090
Speaker 2:  from you in this?

245
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,990
Speaker 10:  If you want to fall down, I can give you a fast sound. It's stuff like

246
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,620
Speaker 10:  Simpsons characters, it's all very character centric. So there'll be like

247
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,280
Speaker 10:  destiny characters, ninjas saying, you know, what the hell did you say to

248
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,990
Speaker 10:  me? Remember that line? The classic

249
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,520
Speaker 2:  After everyone showed me what's on their stream deck, I asked them what their

250
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,240
Speaker 2:  wishlist was, what do they wish the stream deck could do that it can't. And

251
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,140
Speaker 2:  Shawn's request is either the worst idea or the best idea of the bunch.

252
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,290
Speaker 2:  So let's start with that.

253
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,670
Speaker 6:  I want to make a bubble wrap app. Okay. We are going to

254
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,060
Speaker 6:  make a bubble wrap app for the stream deck where you push a button and it

255
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,690
Speaker 6:  just pops a bubble. Cause it feels like that when you

256
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,470
Speaker 6:  touch the stream deck, all of these little keys, they have this delightfully

257
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,370
Speaker 6:  squishy feeling to them, kind of like power and I'm like, we should go all

258
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,520
Speaker 6:  the way. It should make the sound. It should pop the bubble animation of

259
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,110
Speaker 6:  the screen. I think we're going to build it.

260
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,430
Speaker 2:  And here's Liam's idea, which he made me promise. We would not cut out of

261
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,850
Speaker 2:  the show.

262
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,810
Speaker 7:  Top thing on my list that the stream deck needs is to go to

263
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,620
Speaker 7:  sleep. When my Mac goes to sleep, I don't understand this. I have

264
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,550
Speaker 7:  many devices plugged into my Mac that, you know, they're powered

265
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,390
Speaker 7:  over USB. And when I put my Mac to sleep,

266
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,080
Speaker 7:  they go to sleep to stream. Deck just lit up like times

267
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,780
Speaker 7:  square all night long. That's kind of annoying.

268
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,580
Speaker 2:  Dan had some thoughts as well.

269
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,990
Speaker 8:  We've got two buttons set on one page wonders for the space

270
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,410
Speaker 8:  heater in my office to turn on. And one is for it to turn off because I couldn't

271
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,250
Speaker 8:  figure out a toggle to make it just like switch state.

272
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,420
Speaker 8:  I don't know if it's because whatever smart plug I'm using doesn't work with

273
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,690
Speaker 8:  the stream deck directly or whatever. But I had to like use two buttons.

274
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,230
Speaker 8:  So there's a lot of room to improve on the smart home controls.

275
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,950
Speaker 2:  And Tom had an idea and I've been thinking about it for awhile. And I still

276
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,840
Speaker 2:  can't decide if I love it or I hate it.

277
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,920
Speaker 10:  I would love if it could do notifications or if there was a new stream deck

278
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,030
Speaker 10:  that just had like a notification led bar or something. So it was like,

279
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,240
Speaker 10:  here's an email, you know, like, well that sort of stuff, it would be useful

280
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,020
Speaker 10:  not to have that necessarily on my monitor, but like off to the

281
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,030
Speaker 10:  sides that I can check it.

282
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,640
Speaker 2:  Okay. So we've been through all of this and you might be thinking, David,

283
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,540
Speaker 2:  this is all ridiculous. Overkill. You're just buying a gadget to

284
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,500
Speaker 2:  do stuff your computer can already do. And people in general

285
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,430
Speaker 2:  who don't like or understand the stream deck argue just that. And that

286
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,850
Speaker 2:  actually what you should do is learn keyboard shortcuts and use the mouse

287
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,690
Speaker 2:  like a person and save money. You idiot. People have said all these

288
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,350
Speaker 2:  things to me and I think they're wrong. So I asked my stream, decoding colleagues,

289
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,220
Speaker 2:  how'd they'd respond.

290
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,300
Speaker 6:  Keyboard shortcuts are great. And they have plenty of them every now and

291
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,200
Speaker 6:  then I try to remember what some of them are. I like that the stream deck

292
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,160
Speaker 6:  just shows me the things that aren't baked into my muscle

293
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,490
Speaker 6:  memory,

294
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,780
Speaker 7:  The mental process, to remember what your shortcut key is to do this special

295
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,590
Speaker 7:  thing is already too much for me. I just want to hit a button. You'd be

296
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:19,220
Speaker 7:  surprised how much that time adds up over the course of a workweek.

297
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,360
Speaker 9:  The app list just keeps growing and all of those apps are totally

298
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,020
Speaker 9:  free after you've purchased the hardware that it needs.

299
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,090
Speaker 9:  So that's kind of refreshing. Actually.

300
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,480
Speaker 8:  Any keyboard shortcut is actually slower for me to do it because I have to

301
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,360
Speaker 8:  pull my hands on my keyboard, get oriented and like faint. Remember what

302
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,450
Speaker 8:  the keyboard shortcut is or whatever the stream deck makes is super easy

303
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,050
Speaker 8:  to like quickly push something that is one action. And you don't have to

304
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,120
Speaker 8:  like worry about your spatial awareness as much.

305
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,440
Speaker 2:  It just comes back to buttons, right? The verge loves buttons. I love

306
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,400
Speaker 2:  buttons. The stream deck is a simple gadget, but it's also a hugely

307
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,360
Speaker 2:  complicated one. And that's the thing that's so much fun about it. It makes

308
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,050
Speaker 2:  those complicated things simple, but it also berries all kinds of

309
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,920
Speaker 2:  functionality behind one press of one button. I think too

310
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,910
Speaker 2:  much of life is spent in menus and scrolling around stuff and trying to

311
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,940
Speaker 2:  figure out where things are. And I'd rather just have buttons.

312
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,320
Speaker 2:  We're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back to talk to a

313
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,250
Speaker 2:  few more people who have taken the stream deck to even more impressive places

314
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,000
Speaker 2:  and done way more than just improve their zoom setup. We'll be right back

337
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,000
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. When I started doing research for this episode, I found a lot

338
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,090
Speaker 2:  of people doing a lot of the things we just talked about. The stream deck

339
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,270
Speaker 2:  is a great smart home controller. It's really handy for playing music. It

340
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,990
Speaker 2:  can get you off of zoom, all that kind of stuff all over the place. But the

341
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,710
Speaker 2:  more I dug, the more I found people who are using the stream deck to take

342
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,400
Speaker 2:  some of the most complicated technology that exists and

343
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,330
Speaker 2:  simplify it all the way down to a bunch of buttons. Like here's how

344
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,170
Speaker 2:  Simon a YouTuber who makes a channel called better creating uses his stream

345
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,850
Speaker 2:  deck to make video editing easier.

346
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,900
Speaker 12:  For example, I've got a line of buttons in front of me, which are cut

347
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,800
Speaker 12:  blade, which is just to chop a certain thing, cut the whole timeline,

348
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,940
Speaker 12:  trim to start or trim to end. So when you're going through, you can kind

349
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,380
Speaker 12:  of be skimming through with your mouse and just hitting those buttons,

350
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,700
Speaker 12:  trimming the start of the clip, cutting something in half trimming at the

351
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,630
Speaker 12:  beginning of it and so on. So just that frictionless ability

352
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,530
Speaker 12:  to press those three buttons in a row and zoom in and out on the two buttons

353
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,370
Speaker 12:  below on the time. That means that I, I think I cut the speed that I would

354
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,260
Speaker 12:  edit my a roll down in half.

355
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,890
Speaker 2:  Again, this is one of the things I heard over and over from people, both

356
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,700
Speaker 2:  in and out of the verge using a computer now means constantly

357
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,300
Speaker 2:  poking around menus and looking for options and then doing those same things

358
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,930
Speaker 2:  over and over and over again. So instead of doing the long

359
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,890
Speaker 2:  complicated dance in garage band to split tracks and apply a compressor

360
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,820
Speaker 2:  and add a little warmth in the EEQ and then add a slate reverb, why not just

361
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,750
Speaker 2:  hammer the button on your stream deck and have all of that happen automatically

362
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,500
Speaker 2:  every single time. Sounds great. Right? One of the groups taking this idea

363
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,460
Speaker 2:  to its coolest extreme is this huge community of people who use the

364
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,980
Speaker 2:  stream deck when they're playing Microsoft flight simulator,

365
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,320
Speaker 2:  flight simulator is this like massively complicated game. That's the

366
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,040
Speaker 2:  whole point, right? It's like you're flying a plane in every

367
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,030
Speaker 2:  realistic way possible. That is both really fun. And on

368
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,930
Speaker 2:  a computer kind of annoying. Here's how Robert Vander POS who says

369
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,150
Speaker 2:  he's a big flight simulator fan describes it.

370
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,320
Speaker 13:  When I started applied swimming, it really annoyed me how many buttons I

371
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,220
Speaker 13:  had to press with my mouse to fully control the plane. I was really annoyed

372
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,610
Speaker 13:  by that. So I thought, why not? Because I already had a stream deck, which

373
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,210
Speaker 13:  I used for all kinds of shortcuts and my daily jobs, things like starting

374
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,490
Speaker 13:  teams, opening shortcuts and stuff like that.

375
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,900
Speaker 2:  Robert and a bunch of other flight SIM fans decided to stop relying on

376
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,770
Speaker 2:  complicated controller moves and keyboard shortcuts, and they bought stream

377
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,310
Speaker 2:  decks. Instead. Now Robert is the developer of a piece of software called

378
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,610
Speaker 2:  flight deck, which is actually super popular in the flight SIM community.

379
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,820
Speaker 13:  If you look in the plane, especially the big planes, you've got a lot of

380
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,360
Speaker 13:  buttons, especially on your overhead bent. So you don't have to go there

381
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,350
Speaker 13:  with your mouse to click it. You can just press a button that's right

382
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,950
Speaker 13:  on your desk. And that's a lot quicker because you don't have to move your

383
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,850
Speaker 13:  view. You can still keep your eyes on the sky on the, on whatever's in

384
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,910
Speaker 13:  front of you while executing functions in the plane.

385
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,230
Speaker 2:  Flight tech now has custom stream debt control sets for more than 30 different

386
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,130
Speaker 2:  plants, which means more than 30 different complete button layouts, depending

387
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,030
Speaker 2:  on what you're flying. Robert said, he's created more than 1100 icons,

388
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,080
Speaker 2:  hundreds of buttons and knobs and folders, and you can control every

389
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,070
Speaker 2:  light and flap and camera angle, and even turn on the seatbelt sign and

390
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,040
Speaker 2:  fly your whole freaking plane, right from the stream deck.

391
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,120
Speaker 13:  For example, if I take the 7 37 profile, then you've got an

392
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,080
Speaker 13:  overhead panel, a folder, and that contains a lot of sub folder. So for

393
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,980
Speaker 13:  every part of the overhead, Bentall, there's a separate folder and the folders

394
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,670
Speaker 13:  are in order that you're most likely to use them. So when you're

395
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,300
Speaker 13:  starting up the plane, the things you do first that are in that

396
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,040
Speaker 13:  order, cause I make every profile for the 32 spots in

397
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,010
Speaker 13:  stream deck and the 15 butts and stream deck and the 15 button stream deck.

398
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,770
Speaker 13:  That's always the big challenge because then you've got even space to

399
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,340
Speaker 13:  work with

400
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,820
Speaker 2:  Talking to people like Simon and Robert really started to open my eyes to

401
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,600
Speaker 2:  what a device like the stream deck, which again is just a blank set of buttons.

402
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,930
Speaker 2:  Can actually do we live in a world now where if you think about it,

403
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:01,040
Speaker 2:  everything is just an point in software. So you can for

404
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,520
Speaker 2:  instance, use a stream deck to navigate around your notes app like Simon

405
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,180
Speaker 2:  does because notion and many other apps treat all of your pages just as you

406
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,720
Speaker 2:  are else

407
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,860
Speaker 12:  You can put in the address of a page, link that to a

408
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,790
Speaker 12:  button. So rather than navigating between pages in your, the

409
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,660
Speaker 12:  sidebar of your notion system, you can create icons that jumped

410
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,590
Speaker 12:  straight to key pages in your system. So actually I can integrate my

411
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,430
Speaker 12:  homepage and notion with my content creation dashboard in ocean

412
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,450
Speaker 12:  and my Google email or jumping to a website or in one page on

413
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,050
Speaker 12:  stream deck,

414
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,310
Speaker 2:  Or you can go even deeper and do what den Della Marcy did, and actually

415
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,300
Speaker 2:  figure out how the stream deck sends information in order to get it to send

416
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:41,990
Speaker 2:  even more

417
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,140
Speaker 14:  As a developer, I started running into the limitations where I wanted to

418
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,800
Speaker 14:  do things that are developer specific, like connecting to get

419
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,400
Speaker 14:  hub or anything beyond that. And that's when I realized that there was a

420
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,820
Speaker 14:  lot of things that just, you know, I'm not sure if it's, you know, the stream

421
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,030
Speaker 14:  deck is not necessarily tailored for developers, which makes sense. It's

422
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,980
Speaker 14:  stream deck. It's not developer deck.

423
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,640
Speaker 2:  Dan told me he originally bought a stream deck for the same reasons. We keep

424
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,540
Speaker 2:  hearing here to make calls, mute himself, that kind of stuff. But then he

425
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,900
Speaker 2:  decided it wasn't powerful enough and he wanted to write his own software

426
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,710
Speaker 2:  for it. But that required understanding how exactly the stream deck

427
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,600
Speaker 2:  actually works and talks to your computer.

428
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,740
Speaker 14:  I want it to do more without necessarily using the El Gato software

429
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,710
Speaker 14:  because I wanted maybe to connect it to a different device that doesn't

430
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,580
Speaker 14:  support it. So to do that, what I first started doing is there is a tool

431
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,420
Speaker 14:  called Wireshark that basically monitors what happens

432
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,410
Speaker 14:  on your network. So you can capture network packets, but also

433
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,430
Speaker 14:  it's magic superpowers that actually capture the USB transport hurdle. So

434
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,460
Speaker 14:  if you're using a keyboard or the mouse or any USB connected device, it

435
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,900
Speaker 14:  can capture what's happening.

436
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,040
Speaker 2:  Long story short den then built his own software development kit, which lets

437
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,610
Speaker 2:  you build more powerful things for the stream deck. Then Ocado his own tools

438
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,180
Speaker 2:  would let you

439
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,590
Speaker 14:  Tool where the library in this case only basically allows you to

440
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,020
Speaker 14:  connect to the stream deck and send commands to it. But it's up to you to

441
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,590
Speaker 14:  still implement what you wanted to do. For example, I want to

442
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,430
Speaker 14:  see my nest cam and I want to see, well who triggered the alarm

443
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,610
Speaker 14:  or something like that. And I would click the button and it would instantly

444
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,510
Speaker 14:  pop me into like a view or another thing that I did actually fairly

445
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,410
Speaker 14:  recently was when I'd get an alert from nest or something

446
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,780
Speaker 14:  happened, I would just click a button at the base. It says capture. So it

447
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,660
Speaker 14:  would capture the last like 30 seconds of the video and stored in the cloud.

448
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,960
Speaker 14:  A lot of the stuff is entirely customers because it's, it just does not

449
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,740
Speaker 14:  exist. It doesn't integrate yet. But by the power of me knowing how that

450
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,650
Speaker 14:  API works behind the scenes, I just kind of stitched it all together and

451
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,340
Speaker 14:  it's managed by the stream deck. And because every button has

452
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,210
Speaker 14:  basically a mini screen, I can get a snapshot inside

453
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,820
Speaker 14:  that button. However, useless it is. It's very tiny. But to see like

454
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
Speaker 14:  what is in front of my door,

455
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,460
Speaker 2:  This goes back to that URL thing, right? Practically everything in our

456
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,360
Speaker 2:  digital lives is an API or an STK or a URL away.

457
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,020
Speaker 2:  Whether it's the button to leave a zoom call or the live feed of your doorbell

458
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,010
Speaker 2:  camera and people like den are funding evermore, clever ways to bring

459
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,940
Speaker 2:  all of that stuff together. Stack enough of those things on top of each other.

460
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,170
Speaker 2:  And you can do just about anything. I should say though, the stream deck

461
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,010
Speaker 2:  software by itself, doesn't make this as easy as it should. And programming

462
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,730
Speaker 2:  your stream deck can still kind of feel like you're programming a computer,

463
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,850
Speaker 2:  but that's going to get better. As developers build more of these plug and

464
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,750
Speaker 2:  play systems. And as more developers break, the whole system liked ended

465
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,320
Speaker 2:  like I did with the verge. I asked almost everybody. I talked to what their

466
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,410
Speaker 2:  wishlist items were, what they want from the stream deck that it can't currently

467
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,220
Speaker 2:  do in this case, almost everybody had hardware ideas. Some people wanted

468
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,550
Speaker 2:  more buttons. Simon wanted one that didn't have any cables and maybe worked

469
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,910
Speaker 2:  over Bluetooth. Robert told me he wanted one where there's no divider between

470
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,300
Speaker 2:  the buttons. So it looks more like a coherent screen rather than a bunch

471
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,230
Speaker 2:  of individual things. And everybody had ideas about how it should be

472
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,890
Speaker 2:  designed. But one thing I heard a bunch of was that this thing is

473
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,700
Speaker 2:  super powerful and versatile already. So what new

474
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,550
Speaker 2:  superpower could it get that might unlock even more,

475
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,580
Speaker 14:  Hopefully in the future or lease of stream deck, we're going to see at least,

476
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,730
Speaker 14:  you know, like throw a raspberry pie in it, like just, you know, put an

477
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,660
Speaker 14:  SD card maybe that does some, you know, save profiles locally, but that's

478
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,790
Speaker 14:  sort of the future for now. We'll have to work around these constraints

479
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,340
Speaker 14:  by creatively writing suffer and decline computer.

480
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,840
Speaker 2:  After talking to all of these people, I honestly love the stream deck even

481
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,740
Speaker 2:  more, no two people use it exactly the same way, but it makes this

482
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,550
Speaker 2:  complicated technology field simple and just gives you more

483
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,270
Speaker 2:  control over how things work and how you use them. You can tinker with it

484
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,110
Speaker 2:  to your heart's content or just set up a few actions, run your computer from

485
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,740
Speaker 2:  your little control panel and never think about it again. There are no wrong

486
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,060
Speaker 2:  answers, right? It's just buttons. Buttons are great. And if you don't like

487
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,700
Speaker 2:  them, change it. Okay. We're going to take a quick break and then come right

488
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,300
Speaker 2:  back and figure out how you can get the best of the stream. Deck all the

489
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,110
Speaker 2:  automation and control and simplicity without actually needing to buy a stream

490
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,290
Speaker 2:  deck. Because remember it's all about buttons. We'll be right back.

491
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,730
Speaker 16:  What did dinosaurs sound like? Here's Jurassic parks tape

492
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,230
Speaker 16:  that roar was mostly made up of mammal sounds, but dinosaurs were a lot

493
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,270
Speaker 16:  closer to huge birds.

494
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,250
Speaker 16:  And instead of a roar, they might've had more of a punk.

495
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,830
Speaker 15:  It's a honk, but it's like a tuba honk.

496
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,460
Speaker 16:  The biggest deepest weirdest haunt you can imagine

497
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,280
Speaker 15:  Get to tubas

498
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,090
Speaker 15:  and having them play two different notes

499
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,850
Speaker 15:  and then they could rumble. And while your body

500
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,690
Speaker 15:  is still shaking from the rumble, they could blast you with two very low

501
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,380
Speaker 15:  notes.

502
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,690
Speaker 15:  He could get real interesting

503
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,450
Speaker 16:  This weekend. Unexplainable, is it possible to figure out what

504
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,440
Speaker 16:  dinosaurs actually sounded like scientists are giving it their best

505
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,830
Speaker 16:  shot, new episodes, every Wednesday, follow

506
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,420
Speaker 16:  unexplainable, wherever you listen.

507
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,130
Speaker 17:  I'm Alex Heath and I'm co-hosting land of the giants. This season

508
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,270
Speaker 17:  Metta the company formerly known as Facebook so far. We've told

509
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,110
Speaker 17:  the story of mark Zuckerberg journey to reaching billions of users from

510
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,530
Speaker 17:  the creation of the newsfeed to the acquisition of Instagram,

511
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,790
Speaker 17:  but such massive scale that comes at a price in our

512
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:27,540
Speaker 17:  upcoming episodes. We'll examine how the company has had to grapple with

513
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,500
Speaker 17:  the uncomfortable side of its power, from how to reckon with former

514
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,790
Speaker 17:  president Donald Trump.

515
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,660
Speaker 18:  I think mark in the end felt that if you're going to start

516
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,010
Speaker 18:  saying that heads of government, can't threaten to deploy force

517
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,760
Speaker 18:  to restore order, that that sets a really quite a Boris and

518
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,330
Speaker 18:  precedent

519
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,510
Speaker 17:  To the harms, its own technology amplifies

520
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,620
Speaker 19:  Borderline harmful sensational content fundamentally does

521
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,250
Speaker 19:  better under user engage.

522
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,170
Speaker 17:  Well, Zuckerberg is high stakes pivot to building the metaverse work.

523
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,040
Speaker 17:  And if it does, what does that mean for all of us

524
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,810
Speaker 17:  following land of the giants, wherever you listen to hear new episodes every

525
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,200
Speaker 17:  Wednesday.

526
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,540
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Remember how I said at the top that this episode wasn't really

527
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,170
Speaker 2:  about the stream deck. Here's what I mean. The stream deck is many things,

528
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,040
Speaker 2:  many, many, many things, but it's also kind of expensive. The little

529
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,030
Speaker 2:  six buttons stream deck mini I have is 80 bucks. The regular 15

530
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,780
Speaker 2:  button model is 150 bucks and the stream deck XL and it's 32

531
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,560
Speaker 2:  buttons will run you $250. That's a lot of

532
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,550
Speaker 2:  money just to do some stuff your computer can already do. So let's

533
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,490
Speaker 2:  see if there's a cheaper way, maybe a way to repurpose the device you already

534
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,270
Speaker 2:  own or some software that can do some of the awesome automation and

535
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:54,200
Speaker 2:  simplification that the stream deck does. Even if we lose the button,

536
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,040
Speaker 2:  the feel of the whole thing. Can we at least get some of the goodness of

537
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,490
Speaker 2:  the stream deck for a lot less money? That's the question I pose to Alex

538
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,610
Speaker 2:  Cranz and she went off to try and find out. And now she's back to tell us,

539
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,330
Speaker 2:  hi Alex.

540
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,530
Speaker 20:  Hi David. How are you?

541
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,480
Speaker 2:  I'm terrific. How are you?

542
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,440
Speaker 20:  I'm excited to talk about key remapping software more than you

543
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,890
Speaker 20:  think.

544
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,970
Speaker 2:  I actually, I feel like knowing you as I do, the answer is very high. I feel

545
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,550
Speaker 2:  like I'm on brand with that. Are you a stream deck person?

546
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,690
Speaker 20:  No, but I really, I really want one, but like, I feel like it's a bridge

547
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,460
Speaker 20:  too far. Like socially,

548
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,970
Speaker 2:  You just, you're not ready for the lifestyle is what you're saying.

549
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,640
Speaker 20:  Yeah. Like I'm not ready for somebody to come over to my house and be like,

550
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,760
Speaker 20:  what is on your desk? Because my desk is the first thing people see in my

551
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,420
Speaker 20:  home. So I try to keep it like fairly like useful because I'm giant nerd

552
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,080
Speaker 20:  and I'm sitting at all day, but also like, I don't want people to judge

553
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,860
Speaker 20:  me. And I feel like I'll get judged with a stream deck, no judgment to

554
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,520
Speaker 20:  any of our colleagues and listeners who use the stream deck, including

555
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,620
Speaker 20:  Dan who just uses it for zoom.

556
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,920
Speaker 2:  It's yeah. I mean, listen, these are our people. This is what this episode

557
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,400
Speaker 2:  is about. But your job was to find people away to

558
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,330
Speaker 2:  do the same kinds of things that you want to do on a stream

559
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,230
Speaker 2:  deck without actually having to buy a stream deck, which I feel like

560
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,920
Speaker 2:  is a very useful exercise. And I'm realizing, and especially useful exercise

561
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,340
Speaker 2:  for you who might want to do some of these like nerdy

562
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,300
Speaker 2:  automation things, but don't want a giant piece of hardware sitting on your

563
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:17,630
Speaker 2:  desk.

564
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,470
Speaker 20:  What I really wanted to do, and I have not yet figured out yet is I want

565
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,890
Speaker 20:  like one that'll work with like a Kindle or an e-reader just like

566
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,730
Speaker 20:  repurpose one of those old E ink devices. So it's like my

567
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,000
Speaker 20:  calendar and also like turns off my zoom camera.

568
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,470
Speaker 2:  Oh, I liked that idea,

569
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,110
Speaker 20:  But that doesn't exist yet. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I got your, I got your

570
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,530
Speaker 20:  hopes up.

571
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,730
Speaker 2:  Well, the extreme deck is, is a thing that needs to exist. I

572
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,340
Speaker 2:  wasn't going to bring that up, but that is a thing that needs to exist. And

573
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,890
Speaker 2:  I like this idea very much of using an old Kindle. Cause I have like five

574
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,880
Speaker 2:  old Kindles that are just around and I would love to have a

575
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,570
Speaker 2:  better use for them.

576
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,860
Speaker 20:  But for most people you're going to be better off using your

577
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,190
Speaker 20:  number pad because a lot of people have been trying to figure out what to

578
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,850
Speaker 20:  do with the number pad. If you're not like in living in spreadsheets, all

579
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,660
Speaker 20:  of your life. So windows has one called ant softs

580
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,620
Speaker 20:  key re mapper. If you click on the website, you will be like, why

581
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,450
Speaker 20:  did I travel back to 2007?

582
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,340
Speaker 2:  It's bad. It's real bad. The

583
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,330
Speaker 20:  Software is also pretty dense. So, but it's like 15 to

584
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,290
Speaker 20:  $30. Like you get the license, you can also do some revamping just like

585
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,220
Speaker 20:  in windows. So you don't necessarily need to go to that. But if you want

586
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,090
Speaker 20:  like app specific stuff and soft for max, it's a little easier. You

587
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,050
Speaker 20:  can do stuff like I use. I've got Alfred, I'm a huge Alfred fan. I

588
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,530
Speaker 20:  gave up Quicksilver a decade ago and have been Alfred ever since you can

589
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,040
Speaker 20:  also use like the automator shortcuts, like Apple's been building the stuff

590
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,400
Speaker 20:  in from the beginning and then there's like the old

591
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,090
Speaker 20:  school. Yes. Right down to the website, keyboard Maestro. It's like

592
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,750
Speaker 20:  $36. You can do it all. It is much like Ansoff not

593
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,840
Speaker 20:  pretty. This is not a place where like the developers really focusing on

594
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,990
Speaker 20:  UI, which makes sense. Right? Like this is for people who just want like

595
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,860
Speaker 20:  really quick button to turn off their zooms and do other quick automations.

596
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,010
Speaker 20:  So

597
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,400
Speaker 2:  That's fair. Well, and I think I will say the number pad, like off to the

598
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,640
Speaker 2:  right of your keyboard is a very useful place for that. But also what I've

599
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,480
Speaker 2:  heard a bunch of people say is that the function keys are a thing that everyone

600
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,420
Speaker 2:  should be remapping, which I think is very smart. The downside is you have

601
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,600
Speaker 2:  to like, remember what they all are because there's nothing about the F three.

602
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,720
Speaker 2:  He, that like tells you anything of consequence, but you should absolutely

603
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,710
Speaker 2:  remap all of those to be like global universal shortcuts to

604
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,590
Speaker 2:  whatever you want, because otherwise you are never going to touch those keys.

605
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,220
Speaker 20:  I was going to do that, but I'm on a happy hacking keyboard. So I have to

606
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,030
Speaker 20:  already do that just to get to the S3. Like I have to use the function keyboard

607
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,310
Speaker 20:  keys, but it's really good. Cause like on max, it's super easy to be like,

608
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,150
Speaker 20:  oh, I want a universal mute button. I want a universal launch, a

609
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,630
Speaker 20:  specific app button. Like you could just do all of that. Like a lot of this

610
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,900
Speaker 20:  stuff. I think one of the reasons this software you're seeing is so old

611
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,250
Speaker 20:  is because a lot of this stuff you can now just kind of do and windows

612
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,830
Speaker 20:  and Mac. So it's really nice.

613
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,310
Speaker 2:  But if you do want to repurpose an old gadget, like a tablet or a phone for

614
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,120
Speaker 2:  this, there is the stream deck app. It in theory is the stream deck.

615
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,290
Speaker 2:  But for your phone, it is trash. The app is bad. It

616
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,130
Speaker 2:  charges you, I think four bucks a month to use it. It's super slow.

617
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,300
Speaker 2:  It's like the closest thing to what the stream deck could be

618
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,150
Speaker 2:  on your phone, right? Like it's just, it looks like buttons and you press

619
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,780
Speaker 2:  them and things happen, but it's slow and it's bad and it's stupid and you

620
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,680
Speaker 2:  shouldn't use it. Like the stream deck software is not like famously fast

621
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,340
Speaker 2:  and great anyway, but it is the worst version of itself on

622
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,360
Speaker 2:  phones, which is a real bummer. I would not use that unless like forced

623
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,650
Speaker 2:  to, for some reason,

624
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,060
Speaker 20:  Just enough to be like, oh, I get the potential of this. Clearly I need

625
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,260
Speaker 20:  dedicated hardware.

626
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,830
Speaker 2:  There is another app called touch portal. I think, which seems to be the

627
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,720
Speaker 2:  deeply nerdy one that people really like.

628
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,230
Speaker 20:  This is the one that a lot of people enjoy. And they actually like it

629
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,690
Speaker 20:  more than a stream deck.

630
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,470
Speaker 2:  It's just finicky. I feel like it's like mad finicky for all the reasons

631
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,280
Speaker 2:  that people like to tinker with their stream deck. This gives you even

632
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,330
Speaker 2:  more stuff to do. It's like Plex, right in that you like run it from your

633
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,670
Speaker 2:  computer and use it from your device.

634
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,630
Speaker 20:  You're getting a server. And that server is listening for a

635
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,500
Speaker 20:  client software and the client software. You can put it on your old phone,

636
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,430
Speaker 20:  your old Amazon fire tablet that you've had for a billion years. And you

637
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:21,360
Speaker 20:  probably need to just recycle. You can do them all there. And there are

638
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,240
Speaker 20:  a lot of people like, especially a lot of streamers who are like, oh yeah,

639
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,840
Speaker 20:  touch portal is the way to go. And I think that's just because

640
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,830
Speaker 20:  like, I really want something that I can like dig in and customize and get

641
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,790
Speaker 20:  really weird about and make individually mine and 3d print a little case

642
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,300
Speaker 20:  for my old phone and do all of that. So I'm going to go touch portal.

643
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,750
Speaker 2:  The thing that has going for it is that it works everywhere. It's like it's

644
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,350
Speaker 2:  on Mac and windows. I think it's on Android and iPhone. Like it, it does

645
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,490
Speaker 2:  the thing for all the places, which is great. It's so insane to

646
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,580
Speaker 2:  me that the stream deck has not solved this problem. Like, as we're talking

647
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,970
Speaker 2:  about this, I'm getting angrier at how bad the stream deck app is. Because

648
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,310
Speaker 2:  the thing is like, we've been talking about this for years, right? There's

649
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,530
Speaker 2:  that question of like, what do you do with your old devices? Right. Like

650
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,460
Speaker 2:  I have an iPad from like six years ago that like won't install

651
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,270
Speaker 2:  software anymore, but still runs fine. And like the perfect version of

652
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,110
Speaker 2:  those things is that I like use it as a thing on my wall to, you know,

653
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,470
Speaker 2:  control my smart home or whatever. And if I could have one of those that

654
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,370
Speaker 2:  is like a remote control for my computer. That's the dream. It's so

655
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:24,180
Speaker 2:  simple. I want that. I would even happily like connect it. Like apple should

656
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,910
Speaker 2:  make this thing. And it would like iCloud into my computer and it would all

657
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,750
Speaker 2:  work fine. You just have to hack it just one

658
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,810
Speaker 2:  step more than it seems like you should have to. And that's frustrating,

659
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,860
Speaker 2:  but people do love touch portal. So what do I know?

660
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,090
Speaker 20:  Yeah. People love touch portal. They've made it work. There's also another

661
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,750
Speaker 20:  one. That's a little easier than touch portal, but it's also only runs on

662
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,470
Speaker 20:  Android. Only runs on windows. This is for the people who are already like,

663
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,190
Speaker 20:  I really like to get in there and customize my

664
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,000
Speaker 20:  entire workflow, the appearance of my workflow, every

665
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,910
Speaker 20:  little bit of it. And that's magic metric.

666
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,600
Speaker 2:  It's like the, the singular of matrix. It's just one matrix, two

667
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,170
Speaker 2:  matrix.

668
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,920
Speaker 20:  The trick that seemed right. Yeah. So it's totally free.

669
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,920
Speaker 20:  It's a little bit more pared down, but because it's more paired down, it's

670
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,920
Speaker 20:  going to be like easier to set up. You're not going to have to worry about

671
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,130
Speaker 20:  like getting all, everything just right. Cause like touch portal. Part of

672
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,790
Speaker 20:  its appeal, I think to a lot of people is that you can do so

673
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,690
Speaker 20:  much. It does give you so many things, but it's kind of like the first time

674
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,380
Speaker 20:  you play, Skyram go back. It's 2011. You've put

675
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,070
Speaker 20:  Skyram into like your PC or your 360 or whatever. And you're like, I'm going

676
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,250
Speaker 20:  to play this game. This is going to change my life. And that it's like so

677
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,180
Speaker 20:  much stuff. And you're like, okay, well, do I like become the dragon person,

678
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,080
Speaker 20:  the dragon born and like, shout my way to victory. Do I go start like this

679
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,650
Speaker 20:  stop? Like these weird Romans who are doing their thing, do I go build a

680
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,010
Speaker 20:  house, stride, adopt a child? Do I become a blacksmith? Like there's so

681
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,980
Speaker 20:  much going on. And you're like, I don't for me. I just like stopped playing

682
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,640
Speaker 20:  for a year and a half. Cause it overwhelmed me when touch portals kind of

683
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,310
Speaker 20:  like that. There's so much choice that you're like, oh, I don't know where

684
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,320
Speaker 20:  to start. So you want to come in like with a plan

685
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,170
Speaker 2:  As we talk to people through this whole show, one of the things that seems

686
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,830
Speaker 2:  like the key is to any of these devices is start with like a

687
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,380
Speaker 2:  thing. And it's like, okay, I'm going to set this up. It's going to do this

688
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,320
Speaker 2:  one thing for me. And then in the process you like learn how to use it. You

689
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,040
Speaker 2:  fix some of the weird bugs and then you just slowly start to add other stuff,

690
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,160
Speaker 2:  but you need like the one problem you're trying to solve because for me,

691
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,280
Speaker 2:  like I bought a stream deck and was like, this seems neat. I wonder what

692
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,370
Speaker 2:  I'll do with it. And then it just did nothing for a long time. But then when

693
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,820
Speaker 2:  I was like, oh, I'll make it run the light in my office. All of a sudden

694
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,100
Speaker 2:  it was like, okay, now I have a reason to put this in front of me. And then

695
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,440
Speaker 2:  it opened up the rest of everything to me, the

696
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,020
Speaker 20:  Fanciest light switch on the,

697
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,950
Speaker 2:  I mean, could I reach six inches out of frame here and turn off the light?

698
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,350
Speaker 2:  Yes I could. But it's much easier when I have mystery Beck,

699
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,310
Speaker 20:  You seem like, did you guys talk about a lot of the different boutique

700
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:49,120
Speaker 20:  keyboard makers make little number pads and they have little like

701
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,090
Speaker 20:  volume dials on them.

702
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,720
Speaker 2:  I was going to bring this up actually, because one of the things we should

703
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,260
Speaker 2:  say is that for people who are thinking like, oh, maybe I'll do like the

704
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,920
Speaker 2:  keyboard Maestro or the number pad stuff. One thing you can buy pretty cheap

705
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,790
Speaker 2:  is a dedicated number pad that could act as just a set of

706
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,960
Speaker 2:  dedicated buttons for you.

707
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,260
Speaker 20:  Yeah. You could do that. And then you could use one of these like keyboard

708
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,100
Speaker 20:  Maestro, or an soft key wrapper or just honestly

709
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,700
Speaker 20:  Mac and windows do a pretty great job of this stuff nowadays. It just do

710
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,270
Speaker 20:  it. That's been my other way. And that's feels like a little more socially

711
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,930
Speaker 20:  acceptable than the stream deck with its light up keys, which I really love.

712
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,600
Speaker 20:  That's probably like the way I'm going. Cause then like you've got the volume

713
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,380
Speaker 20:  button instead of having like hunt for the volume in my menu bar or

714
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,100
Speaker 20:  hot kit

715
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,950
Speaker 2:  Dial is clutch, but that's a whole other accessory roadmap. We will go down

716
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,900
Speaker 2:  some other day, but

717
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,600
Speaker 20:  It's the same thing. It's it's got the number pad and the dial all in

718
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,970
Speaker 20:  one. So that's kind of where I'm leaning now.

719
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,000
Speaker 2:  That makes sense. And we should say before we go, that if you are a person

720
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,600
Speaker 2:  who wants to use the stream deck for its actual intended use, which is to

721
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,100
Speaker 2:  like live stream yourself, you're actually in much better shape. Cause there's

722
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,960
Speaker 2:  some really good apps out there that plug into OBS, which is the streaming

723
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,900
Speaker 2:  software that everybody use that actually works really well. Cause there's

724
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,390
Speaker 2:  like a big market for that. It's a thing a lot of people do. So if you want

725
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,320
Speaker 2:  to like run your Twitch stream from your tablet, like deck board is supposed

726
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,720
Speaker 2:  to be pretty good. I think upper deck is supposed to be pretty good. Touch

727
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,990
Speaker 2:  portal works really well for this there's one called like stream puppy that

728
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:12,350
Speaker 2:  I was reading about that I just like inherently don't trust. But supposedly

729
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,070
Speaker 2:  people like it, I don't know that kind of stuff is like more

730
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,280
Speaker 2:  functional. So if you want to stream, you hit you're in good shape. But if

731
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,240
Speaker 2:  you want the like wacky productivity stuff that we're about here at the

732
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,200
Speaker 2:  verge, you're kind of,

733
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,860
Speaker 20:  Where do you think it all wrong? We're like none of us Twitch stream.

734
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,460
Speaker 2:  I know it's really true. Okay. So we're all, we're all buying Inc

735
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,660
Speaker 2:  Kindles and hacking them to run stream decks. And when we do, we will be

736
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,670
Speaker 2:  back and we will report on it. Cause that will change my life.

737
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,870
Speaker 20:  It's going to be a lot of tears.

738
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,840
Speaker 2:  It's going to be amazing. All right, Alex. Thank you. Appreciate it.

Speaker 20:  Thank you. Talk to you later.

740
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,360
Speaker 2:  All right. And with that it's time for me to press the button on my stream

741
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,390
Speaker 2:  deck. That turns off my microphone because I have one of those and it's awesome.
