Description: It's a small miracle that a bunch of us managed to get our heads out of Mario Kart World long enough to make a show about the Switch 2. But that's what we did! First, we chat with The Verge's Andrew Webster about his review, and why it feels like the Switch 2 is both everything we wanted and somehow still a little underwhelming. (Or at least just... whelming.) After that, The Verge's Ash Parrish tells us about her adventures traveling with the Switch 2, plus her recent time with the new Asus ROG Xbox Ally, and what she's learning about the future of consoles. Finally, The Verge's Sean Hollister helps us answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline all about console prices: why they keep going up, and whether they'll continue to be worth it.


2
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:06,955
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Rainbow Road. I'm m your

3
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:10,795
Speaker 2:  friend David Pierce, And I am bad at Mario Kart World. I just need to get

4
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:14,715
Speaker 2:  that off my chest. I've been playing Mario Kart like most of my life in various

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,435
Speaker 2:  iterations, And I've usually been pretty good at it. I wouldn't say I'm like

6
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:22,355
Speaker 2:  a, you know, speed running champion of Mario Kart, but I'm pretty good at

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,955
Speaker 2:  it. I could beat most people and now all I can do is come in like 13th

8
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:29,315
Speaker 2:  over and over and over and over again. And it is

9
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:33,835
Speaker 2:  devastating. But now I have discovered I'm in, I, I care

10
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:37,035
Speaker 2:  so deeply about being good at this game that I think the only thing you will

11
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:40,995
Speaker 2:  find me doing for potentially several weeks or months, he's

12
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:44,475
Speaker 2:  playing Mario Kart World. If you wanna play with me and beat me because you

13
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:48,155
Speaker 2:  will let me know, I'm here for it. I am ready. I am

14
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:52,035
Speaker 2:  coming for you Mario Kart World. Anyway, today on the show we are gonna

15
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:55,955
Speaker 2:  talk actually all about the Nintendo Switch too. That's all

16
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:59,195
Speaker 2:  we're doing today. We're gonna talk to Andrew Webster who reviewed the device

17
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:02,555
Speaker 2:  for us. We're gonna talk to Ash Parrish, who has been using the device and

18
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:05,275
Speaker 2:  has been testing a lot of the games, has a lot of thoughts about how this

19
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:08,715
Speaker 2:  is going. We're also gonna talk about some other handheld console news, but

20
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:11,795
Speaker 2:  we'll get to that later. Then we have a hotline question about the switch

21
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:14,635
Speaker 2:  two. I'm telling you, we're just doing switch two stuff today. We've had

22
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:18,235
Speaker 2:  the thing for a while. We have some thoughts about it. It's switched two

23
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:21,315
Speaker 2:  time here on The Vergecast. All of that is coming up in just a second. But

24
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,715
Speaker 2:  first I'm, I'm gonna play more of this stupid game that I can't stop playing.

25
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:28,475
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna come in 13th and then we're gonna do this. This is The Vergecast.

26
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:29,235
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

27
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:15,275
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Andrew Webster is here. Hi Andrew. Hello. I

28
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,755
Speaker 2:  feel like I have dragged you here to talk about the switch several times

29
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:21,835
Speaker 2:  against your will now and I'm very excited to have you back. So thank you

30
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:22,275
Speaker 2:  for doing this.

31
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,075
Speaker 4:  Of course. I always, always here to talk Nintendo.

32
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:29,475
Speaker 2:  So let's talk about the review process As much

33
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:32,675
Speaker 2:  as I, I want to talk about how you feel about this thing, but this has been

34
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:36,555
Speaker 2:  an interesting gadget to review for you over the

35
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,475
Speaker 2:  last week or so. What, what have you been up to? How has this thing been

36
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:39,915
Speaker 2:  going for you?

37
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:44,555
Speaker 4:  Well, yeah, it's been weird 'cause you know, normally

38
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:48,315
Speaker 4:  you get things ahead of time and then we can

39
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:51,515
Speaker 4:  play around with it and then publish something that lets people know whether

40
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:54,835
Speaker 4:  they wanna buy it or not. But Nintendo did not do that

41
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:58,995
Speaker 4:  and my unit showed up two days late. So I've just spent

42
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:03,165
Speaker 4:  every waking moment that wasn't covering one of

43
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:05,965
Speaker 4:  the four live video game events that happened over the past week.

44
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:10,685
Speaker 4:  You know, playing Mario Kart and no mansky and

45
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:13,495
Speaker 4:  figuring out what virtual game cards are.

46
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:18,335
Speaker 2:  So what were the first games you installed? Like what was first thing? I

47
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:20,455
Speaker 2:  mean, I assume Mario Kart World was first. Yeah, because it was the first

48
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:20,775
Speaker 2:  one everybody

49
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:24,495
Speaker 4:  Did. It was Mario Kart World and then Fortnite and

50
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:28,135
Speaker 4:  Nomad Sky were like the two two ones. 'cause I feel like those, especially,

51
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,205
Speaker 4:  I put in a number of hours that I won't say publicly.

52
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:36,885
Speaker 4:  So like I can really tell the difference. And they both like struggled

53
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,205
Speaker 4:  hardcore on the first switch. So they're pretty notable upgrades.

54
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:44,725
Speaker 2:  So I want to come back to this 'cause I think the, the, the Fortnite of it

55
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,645
Speaker 2:  all, I actually think might be a really telling way to distinguish the

56
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,205
Speaker 2:  new Switch. But let's talk about this thing as just a, a piece of hardware

57
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:56,325
Speaker 2:  first. You, you've spent a lot of time on the first switch And I think the,

58
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:59,805
Speaker 2:  the question we talked a bunch about in the run up to this thing is

59
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:05,085
Speaker 2:  what do we want a better switch to be? And there are, there are a bunch

60
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:08,805
Speaker 2:  of things that could be including some sort of wildly different idea about

61
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:12,565
Speaker 2:  what a Nintendo Switch console might be or look like or do.

62
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:16,965
Speaker 2:  And instead we got a thing that is just like a full rev of specs in in most

63
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:20,965
Speaker 2:  ways, I would say Pure as a piece of hardware. What, what

64
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:23,965
Speaker 2:  have you felt about it so far? Does it, does it feel like they got the thing

65
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:26,245
Speaker 2:  right in just trying to make it better across the board?

66
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:30,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's like, I, I don't say this in like a bad way. It's good enough.

67
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:34,605
Speaker 4:  Like it's, it's what they needed to do. I've written about this thing like

68
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:37,965
Speaker 4:  at many different points, including before it came out and every time I was

69
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:41,645
Speaker 4:  just like, it's a switch, but better. And finding new ways to say that is

70
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:45,285
Speaker 4:  difficult, But that really, even after spending, you know, an entire week

71
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,165
Speaker 4:  with it, it's a switch but better.

72
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:52,165
Speaker 2:  So what, what about it jumps out to you as better? Like what are the sort

73
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:53,645
Speaker 2:  of most noticeably better things?

74
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:57,205
Speaker 4:  I mean just the way games run is like a huge difference. Like we talk about

75
00:04:57,205 --> 00:05:01,045
Speaker 4:  Mario Car World and like developers Indo had said

76
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:04,485
Speaker 4:  that, you know, when they were developing this game for the Switch, they

77
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:08,125
Speaker 4:  were like getting scared 'cause it's not gonna work on it. And you play it

78
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,845
Speaker 4:  on Switch two and it runs beautifully. You know, I was

79
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:15,645
Speaker 4:  doing like four player split screen and this game is like so

80
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:19,405
Speaker 4:  chaotic, you know, everything explodes. You have like two bullet

81
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:22,805
Speaker 4:  bills at the same time while you're getting hit with a blue shell. And like

82
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,885
Speaker 4:  all that stuff's happening on your TV at the same time and it runs great.

83
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:30,485
Speaker 4:  Like it's just not a game that would be possible in the other switch. And

84
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:34,205
Speaker 4:  yeah, and like Fortnite, you know, our colleague Charles wrote about

85
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,485
Speaker 4:  like when he played it on the switch too for the first time 'cause he only

86
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:40,605
Speaker 4:  played it on the switch. It was like, holy shit, this is like how you people

87
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:43,845
Speaker 4:  have been living. Like he bought all these skins and they That's so funny.

88
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,925
Speaker 4:  He could actually tell who they were on the new hardware 'cause they just

89
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:49,565
Speaker 4:  were like polygonal trash before.

90
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,685
Speaker 2:  I feel like that's the same as like if you've been playing Fortnite only

91
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:55,085
Speaker 2:  on your phone for the last decade, you're like, yeah, this game is fine,

92
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:58,365
Speaker 2:  but like what's the, yeah, what's the fuss about about Fortnite? And then

93
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:01,165
Speaker 2:  you get, you get the full Fortnite experience and you're like, oh, this is

94
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:02,245
Speaker 2:  actually kind of sick.

95
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:05,165
Speaker 4:  And it's like, you know, you're still grading Nintendo on a curve. It doesn't

96
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,925
Speaker 4:  look as good as a PS five or whatever, but like it looks very good and

97
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:12,475
Speaker 4:  especially in portable mode, you know, it's, it's Fortnite.

98
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:16,915
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So this, this is a dumb question and

99
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,795
Speaker 2:  you're better equipped to answer than I am. And one of the things I've been

100
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,475
Speaker 2:  trying to figure out about the switch to is

101
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:27,595
Speaker 2:  games look dramatically better And I can't figure out whether that's

102
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:31,555
Speaker 2:  because I have the old like OG pre O

103
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:35,195
Speaker 2:  led switch and So I'm actually upgrading like a couple of

104
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,475
Speaker 2:  generations of display or if it is because

105
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,075
Speaker 2:  there's just so much more processing power that actually the games themselves

106
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:46,795
Speaker 2:  are able to be made to look better. And So I,

107
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:48,995
Speaker 2:  but I just keep staring at the screen being like, I can't believe how much

108
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:52,635
Speaker 2:  better this looks even for like games that I played on

109
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:53,675
Speaker 2:  the old switch.

110
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:57,595
Speaker 4:  Yeah, like the, the screen is obviously better, although like I, I mentioned

111
00:06:57,595 --> 00:07:01,515
Speaker 4:  this on a review, but like I do miss the O lead, like it was, it's much

112
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:05,395
Speaker 4:  more vibrant, but you know, the screen is better, but it, I think it is

113
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:09,275
Speaker 4:  more the, the processing issue. You know, it's not

114
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:13,195
Speaker 4:  the screen that makes the eShop actually usable for once where you

115
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:16,835
Speaker 4:  can input codes and it doesn't take half an hour. Fair. So

116
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:20,495
Speaker 4:  yeah, it's, it's like, you know, Nintendo is not

117
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:25,475
Speaker 4:  a, a company like to make beefy consoles, but this is like, you

118
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:29,275
Speaker 4:  know, I can play cyberpunk and it looks good even in portable mode.

119
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,955
Speaker 4:  You know, that game was a disaster when it first came out on like previous

120
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:36,955
Speaker 4:  gen consoles and it runs great on the switch. I mean it's, it's not the

121
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:40,235
Speaker 4:  latest open world game, but it's a big thing and it's a big technical test

122
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:41,395
Speaker 4:  and it, it works great.

123
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:45,675
Speaker 2:  Have you run into anything that feels like it's pressing up against the edges

124
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,355
Speaker 2:  of what the Switch two can do? So

125
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:51,275
Speaker 4:  The only, like stuff that's looked bad for me is doing,

126
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:55,355
Speaker 4:  so there's like a new feature called Game Share where it's like

127
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:59,915
Speaker 4:  with one copy of the game you basically like stream it to someone

128
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:03,795
Speaker 4:  who's nearby. So like me and you were hanging out, we can play it and

129
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,955
Speaker 4:  well, me and my kids were playing this game called Survival Kids, which is

130
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:10,875
Speaker 4:  exactly what sounds like it looked fine. But then my wife And I were playing

131
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,555
Speaker 4:  split fiction, which is kind of like AAA ish quality game

132
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:19,315
Speaker 4:  and like she was on the, the old switch, I was on the switch too and like

133
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:23,475
Speaker 4:  it looked terrible. So I think that's stuff, but that's, I

134
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:27,435
Speaker 4:  think that's more of like a streaming issue than like a hardware issue. But

135
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:30,555
Speaker 4:  yeah, you know, I'm the kind of person who drives around Myocar world and

136
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:34,515
Speaker 4:  like takes pictures of all the signs. Sure. So I notice things that probably

137
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,155
Speaker 4:  people don't notice, but like, you know, some of that stuff looks a little

138
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:41,035
Speaker 4:  fuzzy or low res, but nothing like huge that

139
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:43,355
Speaker 4:  normal people would notice, I don't think. Okay.

140
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:47,275
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it does feel like Nintendo in general is pretty well calibrated

141
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:50,875
Speaker 2:  to like having enough power to do what it needs to do without having

142
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:55,485
Speaker 2:  tons of headroom, which I think is potentially

143
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:58,765
Speaker 2:  sort of problematic as you get to like the eighth year of a console cycle.

144
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:03,485
Speaker 2:  But in these first runs it's, I I can't remember a Nintendo experience where

145
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:06,325
Speaker 2:  I have felt like something was sort of underpowered on the first day. Yeah.

146
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,165
Speaker 2:  And Nintendo just does a good job of that.

147
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:11,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And the only other thing they have is like a bunch of quizzes. So,

148
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:14,685
Speaker 4:  you know, if that didn't run well or we're in trouble. Yeah,

149
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:15,125
Speaker 2:  That's fair.

150
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,085
Speaker 2:  What, what do you feel about the, the joycons, the controllers? I know everybody

151
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:23,925
Speaker 2:  has had a lot of feelings about potential drift issues again because

152
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:27,885
Speaker 2:  they're not Hall effect joysticks, but I am

153
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:30,845
Speaker 2:  certainly no controller expert. What, what has been your JoyCon experience

154
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:31,205
Speaker 2:  so far?

155
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:36,285
Speaker 4:  Again, they're just like a little bit better. Like I think being bigger

156
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:39,845
Speaker 4:  helps 'em, especially when you're like, you know, splitting 'em apart and

157
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,765
Speaker 4:  having two people using them, it makes a big difference. You

158
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:47,525
Speaker 4:  know, we'll have to find out if drift becomes an issue. The mouse thing is

159
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:50,925
Speaker 4:  like, fine. I was playing Civ for a while and it's like,

160
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,445
Speaker 4:  it works, but it's not the most comfortable way to to to hold a

161
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:59,245
Speaker 4:  controller on your thigh moving it around. So it's kinda like the,

162
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:02,365
Speaker 4:  they're they're pretty similar to the console as a whole where it's just

163
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:05,965
Speaker 4:  like, you know, they made it slightly better. I will say the magnet thing

164
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,845
Speaker 4:  is very satisfying to like snap them in and out.

165
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:12,045
Speaker 2:  It is, yeah. And in a way that I, going back to the, the original switch

166
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:16,005
Speaker 2:  now, it feels that mechanism always felt sort of fragile. Like I was

167
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:19,885
Speaker 2:  gonna accidentally break the thing you had to sort of slide it into

168
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:23,445
Speaker 2:  on the edges and then the whole thing was gonna fall apart. This feels, it,

169
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:27,045
Speaker 2:  it feels like it's gonna come out in the way that like my AirPods always

170
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:30,645
Speaker 2:  feel like they're gonna come outta my ears, but they never do. And so far

171
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:34,445
Speaker 2:  it's, it's, I have not had one problem with like detaching when I

172
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:38,325
Speaker 2:  didn't want it to, even though it, it feels like it should be flimsier than

173
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,645
Speaker 2:  it actually seems to be.

174
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:42,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Honestly the same with like the kickstand. Like the kickstand is like,

175
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:46,125
Speaker 4:  seems like it should be flimsy. It's like a cutout you, but it's like

176
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:48,725
Speaker 4:  the sturdiest of all the models I've seen so far.

177
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah, it's good. So is there anything about the hardware that has been

178
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:52,805
Speaker 2:  disappointing to you?

179
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:58,705
Speaker 4:  I think I, I don't wanna buy, what are they

180
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,665
Speaker 4:  called? Micro SD express card for it. Yeah. But like

181
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:05,205
Speaker 4:  the games are bigger now and so it takes up, even though they gave you more

182
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:09,085
Speaker 4:  space, like if cyberpunks like 50 gigs, that's like

183
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:12,725
Speaker 4:  a fifth of your console already. Yeah. So I've already been like

184
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:15,885
Speaker 4:  deleting and moving things around a weekend.

185
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:21,085
Speaker 4:  So I mean that's just the nature of like having bigger games but like, you

186
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:25,005
Speaker 4:  know, in comparison to a PlayStation or Xbox where I don't do

187
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:28,885
Speaker 4:  that as much and the games are even bigger, it's, it's pretty annoying and

188
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:30,685
Speaker 4:  the battery life is not as good.

189
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:34,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What, what have you experienced so far? I think we've, the, the coverage

190
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:38,205
Speaker 2:  we've done, it seems to suggest that people are having pretty

191
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:43,045
Speaker 2:  mixed but generally not super impressive experiences with

192
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:43,645
Speaker 2:  the battery.

193
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:46,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think the low end Nintendo says is like two hours and that's like,

194
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:47,525
Speaker 2:  That's pretty

195
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:50,525
Speaker 4:  Bad if you're playing, if you're, I I think it really depends what you're

196
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:53,650
Speaker 4:  playing. If you're doing like, like the game share stuff seems to really

197
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:58,285
Speaker 4:  take the battery something big like cyberpunk really seems to do it. If

198
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,965
Speaker 4:  I'm just like messing around in free row and Mario Kart, it seems okay. But

199
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:05,525
Speaker 4:  I think like the really intensive games seem to really drain it and

200
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:07,765
Speaker 4:  hit that lower end that they're, they're saying.

201
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:12,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean I think I, I feel like the, the switch,

202
00:12:12,425 --> 00:12:13,405
Speaker 2:  the switch one

203
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:18,645
Speaker 2:  was normally somewhere in the like five hour range for kind of normal

204
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:22,765
Speaker 2:  use for a lot of people and that felt fine. Two is tough. Yeah. Two is not

205
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:23,285
Speaker 2:  enough battery

206
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:27,565
Speaker 4:  That's like, you know, wouldn't get me to San Francisco on a flight so.

207
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,125
Speaker 4:  Right.

208
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,965
Speaker 2:  Exactly. Yeah, it's, it's pretty rough.

209
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:35,925
Speaker 2:  The the storage thing I, I tend to agree I think is kind of odd and

210
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:40,075
Speaker 2:  256 gigs is fine, but even going up

211
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:43,835
Speaker 2:  to like five 12 chain goes from, I am sort of

212
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:47,435
Speaker 2:  constantly managing which games I have on my console to like most people

213
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:50,755
Speaker 2:  would probably just be able to have all of the games they're actively playing

214
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:55,155
Speaker 2:  available and it's like, there's just, that's the one hardware upgrade that

215
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:58,075
Speaker 2:  it feels like Nintendo just didn't quite push far

216
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:01,235
Speaker 4:  Enough. Yeah. And I think part of it is like their games are like super optimized.

217
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:04,515
Speaker 4:  They're tiny. Right. But like every third party if you know Cyberpunk Street

218
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:08,395
Speaker 4:  Fire six, even like Yakuza, which is like a PS four

219
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:12,355
Speaker 4:  game is like 40 gigs, which is, you know, pretty, pretty good size for a

220
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:12,955
Speaker 4:  device like this.

221
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:17,275
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What's your normal setup? How do you play? Are you a dock

222
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,355
Speaker 2:  guy with a controller? Are you all handheld? What's your, what's your move?

223
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:20,595
Speaker 2:  I

224
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:23,635
Speaker 4:  Work around everyone else, man. Okay. If, if the TV's free then I'm using

225
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:27,355
Speaker 4:  the TV otherwise, but I did spend like, you know, we had a nice

226
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:30,595
Speaker 4:  weekend up here and I spent like, you know, a lot of time on the couch in

227
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:32,635
Speaker 4:  the backyard just playing cyberpunk. It was nice.

228
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,935
Speaker 2:  I mean that's, that's the dream. Yeah. Right in the backyard playing cyberpunk

229
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,935
Speaker 2:  is like a, a life I can get ready for. Yeah.

230
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:43,135
Speaker 4:  I, I, I rarely do tabletop just 'cause it's, I don know, I find I, I'm not

231
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:46,975
Speaker 4:  a fan of like the split controller thing and not bring a thing with me.

232
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:51,535
Speaker 4:  I tested a bunch for the, the mouse controls but I, I'm not

233
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:54,615
Speaker 4:  a PC gamer so you know, it's kinda lost on me.

234
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:57,935
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's fair. How have you felt about the overall like size and weight

235
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:00,935
Speaker 2:  of the thing and especially in handheld mode actually holding the thing.

236
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:01,815
Speaker 2:  So

237
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:05,415
Speaker 4:  Like I thought it would bother me 'cause like when you put it up next to

238
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:09,335
Speaker 4:  a switch, like it's a pretty big difference. But like it's,

239
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,135
Speaker 4:  I have not really had any issues.

240
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:17,855
Speaker 4:  I, I passed it to my, my 12-year-old 'cause she's put in like a lot of hours

241
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,335
Speaker 4:  in Pokemon. Just if she could see a difference and

242
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:25,175
Speaker 4:  two hours later she came back to, I like had to grab it away from her 'cause

243
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:29,095
Speaker 4:  she wouldn't give it back. And she like, you know, tiny little hands

244
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:32,175
Speaker 4:  didn't have any issues with this big thing. So I think, you know,

245
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:36,575
Speaker 4:  mileage varies obviously, but for me it's been, it's been fine. And

246
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,775
Speaker 4:  whether she just wants extra screen time or actually doesn't have a problem

247
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,575
Speaker 4:  with it, you know, my daughter seemed all right.

248
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:46,875
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So do you find yourself slightly disappointed

249
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:50,875
Speaker 2:  with the idea that it is just a better switch because you, you seem

250
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:55,015
Speaker 2:  slightly disappointed by the idea that there's not some bigger swing in this

251
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:55,335
Speaker 2:  console.

252
00:14:56,465 --> 00:15:00,425
Speaker 4:  I don't know. I think what we need to see is like Nintendo making

253
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:04,305
Speaker 4:  those swings. I think with the experiences, I think if they just continue

254
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:07,905
Speaker 4:  doing like this form factor in this style of hardware,

255
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:12,185
Speaker 4:  that's fine. If they don't get complacent in the other areas,

256
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:16,225
Speaker 4:  like world is like a very interesting expansion of Mario Carr. You can't

257
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:19,465
Speaker 4:  just, they realize we can't just like add more levels like we did before.

258
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:23,945
Speaker 4:  We're gonna try this new thing. Donkey Kong weirdly seems like a very

259
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:28,145
Speaker 4:  interesting platformer where you can like deform the terrain and do

260
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:31,745
Speaker 4:  all this kind of crazy stuff. But like I feel like we need to see more of

261
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:35,305
Speaker 4:  that stuff. Like the equivalent of like a Labo kind of thing because

262
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:39,665
Speaker 4:  yeah, like the hardware is like a tough thing to make

263
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:42,865
Speaker 4:  those swings on and Nintendo is in like a very comfortable position that

264
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:46,705
Speaker 4:  they obviously don't wanna mess with. But you know,

265
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,585
Speaker 4:  I think the issue comes with them being too comfortable on the software

266
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:54,545
Speaker 4:  side, which we don't know enough about yet. 'cause there's like only

267
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:58,505
Speaker 4:  a couple switch to exclusives. The other big stuff coming is like, you

268
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:00,985
Speaker 4:  know, cross-platform stuff like Metro and Pokemon. So

269
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:05,465
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I am, I'm part of the reason I ask is I've been torn about how

270
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:08,545
Speaker 2:  to feel about this too. 'cause I think I've been saying all along that like,

271
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:12,545
Speaker 2:  give me the, the thesis of the original switch all the way back to

272
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:16,505
Speaker 2:  2017. I think that was the correct way to think about what

273
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:20,065
Speaker 2:  gaming should be. Just like make the processor and the wifi faster And

274
00:16:20,385 --> 00:16:23,865
Speaker 2:  I will be happy and like

275
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:28,185
Speaker 2:  check and check right. That that stuff has worked. But I think a

276
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:31,345
Speaker 2:  lot of people have had the experience of like, I played the switch for a

277
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:35,265
Speaker 2:  long time and then I got a switch too and just immediately settled into

278
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:38,065
Speaker 2:  it and it's like it doesn't, I don't know if this is your experience too.

279
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:41,465
Speaker 2:  I just kind of stopped thinking about it as a new console almost immediately.

280
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:45,545
Speaker 2:  Which on the one hand sort of a huge victory, right? Like the, the upgrade

281
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:49,425
Speaker 2:  process is pretty smooth. The the thing works pretty well. I haven't turned

282
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:53,385
Speaker 2:  on my switch one since 10 minutes after I started working with the Switch

283
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:57,265
Speaker 2:  two. The whole thing just like flips and still feels like

284
00:16:57,305 --> 00:17:00,825
Speaker 2:  a switch only better. And there's part of that that's like great nicely

285
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:04,705
Speaker 2:  done, perfectly executed job by Nintendo. And then there's part of me that

286
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:08,505
Speaker 2:  is like, I spent $500 on this thing and it feels more or less like the old

287
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:12,385
Speaker 2:  thing. And So I don't, I don't know what I wanted Nintendo to do to

288
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:16,345
Speaker 2:  make this feel sort of weird and wild and different. But the

289
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:20,065
Speaker 2:  company's so good at doing that most of the time when it does it that

290
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:23,465
Speaker 2:  it's almost you, you almost feel it when it's not sort of mind

291
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:27,345
Speaker 2:  blowingly new in some way. Yeah. And I don't know how

292
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:31,065
Speaker 2:  Nintendo is even supposed to split those two things simultaneously, but I

293
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:34,585
Speaker 2:  did feel that little bit of like, this is it even though it's exactly what

294
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:35,385
Speaker 2:  I wanted. Yeah,

295
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:39,025
Speaker 4:  It's, I mean and it honestly is the same across

296
00:17:39,195 --> 00:17:42,705
Speaker 4:  every console platform at the moment as they become more like smartphones

297
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:46,625
Speaker 4:  where they're just like steady upgrades. Like the PS five has a

298
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:50,445
Speaker 4:  great controller and stuff looks better, but it's the same thing. I,

299
00:17:50,745 --> 00:17:54,205
Speaker 4:  the first thing I did was play Fortnite on it to compare it to the PS four.

300
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:58,525
Speaker 4:  So it's like Nintendo is stuck in that space where it's like we wanna

301
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:02,005
Speaker 4:  keep this audience but like how do we keep them interested? I think, I think

302
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:05,495
Speaker 4:  the, the real thing will be when we see the next

303
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,935
Speaker 4:  Zelda and or Mario and see like what they do to

304
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:13,295
Speaker 4:  take advantage of the hardware. 'cause obviously Mario card's like the big

305
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:16,375
Speaker 4:  game in terms of sales. But I think those are the two showcase

306
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:21,255
Speaker 4:  franchises Nintendo has, I think SDO probably be a while 'cause they just

307
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:25,095
Speaker 4:  put one out last year. But like, you know, part of what made the switch

308
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:29,055
Speaker 4:  work was it launched with Breath of the Wild, right? And it was

309
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:32,775
Speaker 4:  like, you know, not only did we make an open world Zelda, but hey

310
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:36,775
Speaker 4:  you can like take it on a plane, which is like a pretty good sales

311
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:40,415
Speaker 4:  pitch Mario karts like, you know, a crowd pleaser game. But it doesn't have

312
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:43,535
Speaker 4:  that same impact especially in terms of selling.

313
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:46,175
Speaker 4:  What's different about the hardware?

314
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:50,895
Speaker 2:  Do you have a theory on what that might look like on the switch to like the,

315
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,055
Speaker 2:  what could be the equivalent of the now you can take it on a plane.

316
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:59,015
Speaker 4:  I mean I think if I knew what it was then it would be a boring thing for

317
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:02,175
Speaker 4:  Nintendo. I think the thing they need to do is like the Nintendo thing where

318
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:06,135
Speaker 4:  it's like, I didn't even think of this, you know, Mario Karts a little

319
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:10,095
Speaker 4:  bit of that. Like I wouldn't have expected 'em to make an open world cart

320
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:13,975
Speaker 4:  racing game And I would not have expected Donkey Conk to

321
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:17,935
Speaker 4:  be like a tent pole 3D platforming game. But those are still, you know, it's

322
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:21,895
Speaker 4:  Mario Kart and Donkey Kong. Like they need, I think a Zelda And

323
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,735
Speaker 4:  I, Mario that does something that shows you, hey, this couldn't exist before.

324
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,695
Speaker 4:  I don know if they're waiting to have like more of an install base or what

325
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:32,615
Speaker 4:  the plan is there, but I think one of those needs to do something

326
00:19:32,615 --> 00:19:35,895
Speaker 4:  that I wouldn't have thought of. 'cause that's like what Nintendo is. They

327
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:39,415
Speaker 4:  do the things you don't think of and you're like, wait, this

328
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:42,495
Speaker 4:  is great and it makes perfect sense, so why didn't someone think of it?

329
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:46,735
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Do you think it's possible that part of the answer there is to

330
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:49,935
Speaker 2:  kind of keep increasing the line of accessories? Like I just look at the,

331
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:54,575
Speaker 2:  the Piranha game chat camera that, that Nintendo

332
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:57,695
Speaker 2:  announced, which I didn't buy. I bought the boring one And I like really

333
00:19:57,695 --> 00:20:00,495
Speaker 2:  regret it. It was sitting right next to the Piranha one And I should have

334
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:04,415
Speaker 2:  bought the Piranha. But I, I've always wondered why Nintendo doesn't sort

335
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:07,095
Speaker 2:  of go further down that road. It's like there's the, there's the Mario Kart

336
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:10,815
Speaker 2:  wheel, there's the plant and there's not that much else.

337
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:14,095
Speaker 2:  But like, if you're gonna embrace this modular thing, there's a huge

338
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,975
Speaker 2:  potential sort of way you could do all kinds of different

339
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:22,695
Speaker 2:  sorts of controller and camera stuff and make more stuff outta game chat.

340
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:26,095
Speaker 2:  And I don't know, a a deep long road of accessories Nintendo could go down.

341
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:28,775
Speaker 2:  Do you think, is that part of where it goes from here? Like

342
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,695
Speaker 2:  similar-ish base but new-ish ideas about how to

343
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:33,735
Speaker 2:  accessorize it?

344
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:37,175
Speaker 4:  Maybe. I mean they, they like they've done that in the past. Like some of

345
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:40,415
Speaker 4:  the biggest We games were like we Fit, which had its own,

346
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,535
Speaker 4:  what was it called? The balance board for, for exercising on, right. Yeah.

347
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,055
Speaker 4:  I think it does sort of

348
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:51,225
Speaker 4:  fragment things in a way. So like, I think a good example is like a

349
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:55,385
Speaker 4:  ring fit adventure that came up for the switch, which was like, it just came

350
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:59,065
Speaker 4:  with like a wheel, like an exercise ring, but you

351
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:02,105
Speaker 4:  slotted the JoyCon controller. And so it's like, I think finding ways to

352
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:05,945
Speaker 4:  do that would make sense. So it's like a cheap pack in with with

353
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:09,945
Speaker 4:  a thing as opposed to like, you know, you need to need to buy an $80 controller

354
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:12,545
Speaker 4:  to, to play this game. Which severely fragments

355
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:17,585
Speaker 4:  what what you can do. Maybe there's something with like the Mouse they can

356
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:20,265
Speaker 4:  do with that when they finally make Mario Paints. I don dunno, but

357
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:24,145
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. What have you, what have you seen in some of the new sort of

358
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:28,025
Speaker 2:  digital game ideas? Like there's the new thing where

359
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:31,785
Speaker 2:  you can like kind of share games across consoles and then there's the, the

360
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:34,865
Speaker 2:  streaming stuff you were talking about. But it seems like, at least from

361
00:21:34,865 --> 00:21:38,825
Speaker 2:  what I can tell, the basic interface of the switch too is like essentially

362
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:42,545
Speaker 2:  the same thing as as the last one. But they seem to have some new ideas about

363
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:46,105
Speaker 2:  how to sort of manage and share and move games around.

364
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,145
Speaker 2:  Has that stuff worked for you?

365
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,825
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's, it seems okay. It's like it takes a

366
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:56,505
Speaker 4:  minute to wrap your head around that they're sort of trying to treat digital

367
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:00,305
Speaker 4:  games as if you have a physical card and it has to be in one switch and not

368
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:03,265
Speaker 4:  in the other. But I think actually in particular in my household where we

369
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:07,065
Speaker 4:  have like now I guess five switches, it's a actually

370
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:11,105
Speaker 4:  a way to keep track of things the way before it was pretty convoluted.

371
00:22:11,105 --> 00:22:15,065
Speaker 4:  This is not necessarily less convoluted, but I think once you think of

372
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:18,385
Speaker 4:  it in the weird way that Nintendo wants you to, that these are actual

373
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:19,745
Speaker 4:  cartridges, it

374
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:23,625
Speaker 2:  Basically like turns the digital game into like a, an actual physical

375
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,265
Speaker 2:  object that you move from place to place Exactly. Is kind of the idea. Right.

376
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:26,505
Speaker 2:  Okay.

377
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:29,705
Speaker 4:  So like, you know, when I installed Super Mario

378
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:34,385
Speaker 4:  Wonder on the Switch too, I was like taking it out of my OLED

379
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:37,705
Speaker 4:  switch basically, but digitally, so

380
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,465
Speaker 4:  probably depends on the circumstances, but I think, you know, in a household

381
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:45,185
Speaker 4:  with a bunch of switches and kids, it's actually a way to share things that

382
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:48,945
Speaker 4:  make sense. It just, you know, it's weird in an Nintendo way that like,

383
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:50,545
Speaker 4:  it takes a minute to wrap your head around.

384
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:54,105
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. And I think to me it seems like

385
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:58,985
Speaker 2:  that goes back to the same sort of thing that it's like Nintendo is

386
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:02,855
Speaker 2:  making a bunch of decisions here that that kind of individually make

387
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:06,775
Speaker 2:  sense, right? Like I get, I, I would rather just be able to have all my games

388
00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:10,055
Speaker 2:  everywhere all the time. But I, I can understand why that doesn't really

389
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,775
Speaker 2:  work that way. And moving games between consoles is

390
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:16,935
Speaker 2:  traditionally terrible. So I'm like, okay, this is slightly convoluted, but

391
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:19,375
Speaker 2:  I get why Nintendo is doing it this way. This this sort of makes sense.

392
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:24,055
Speaker 2:  But then again it it all falls into this like yeah. It just, it just kind

393
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:27,975
Speaker 2:  of works and you kind of stop thinking about it. Yeah. Zone by the way, have

394
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:31,295
Speaker 2:  you, is everybody else in your family clamoring for a switch too now? Like

395
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:34,655
Speaker 2:  is it once they get the new one is, does the old one seem like

396
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:35,295
Speaker 2:  junk?

397
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,335
Speaker 4:  No. In fact we've already, like Pokemon Violet has already like jumped back

398
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,335
Speaker 4:  and forth between the two systems. Interesting. My kid plays whatever is

399
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:46,085
Speaker 4:  free. So I, And I think that speaks to like,

400
00:23:46,495 --> 00:23:49,165
Speaker 4:  first of all, it makes it good if you're up if you have a family and you're

401
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:52,365
Speaker 4:  upgrading to switch to, 'cause they're fine with the, with the old one. So

402
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:56,325
Speaker 4:  that, that's like a positive for us. But yeah, I think it speaks to,

403
00:23:56,865 --> 00:24:00,475
Speaker 4:  to this like thing of it not being that

404
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:04,435
Speaker 4:  different or exciting where it's like, I see all this stuff.

405
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:08,275
Speaker 4:  I, I honestly don't think my 12-year-old noticed much of a difference when

406
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:11,635
Speaker 4:  she spent 10 hours playing Pokemon Violet. So.

407
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:15,515
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah. That's that's very fair. So it seems like a

408
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:19,235
Speaker 2:  big part of the kind of open questions about the Switch to are

409
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:23,155
Speaker 2:  going to be the games that come the rest of this summer. And I think

410
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:28,155
Speaker 2:  we're due for a pretty serious run of stuff over the next couple of months.

411
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:31,795
Speaker 2:  Right. I remember the, we, we saw that direct in whatever that was like

412
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,435
Speaker 2:  April with a pretty, we ca we all came outta that thinking that was a pretty

413
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:39,435
Speaker 2:  strong set of launch ish games.

414
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:42,995
Speaker 2:  Is there anything you're looking at in particular being like, okay, this

415
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:46,755
Speaker 2:  is, this is gonna start to be the test of where you can really push this

416
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:49,395
Speaker 2:  thing. Obviously I think Donkey Kong bonanza is the, is the obvious one.

417
00:24:49,395 --> 00:24:49,955
Speaker 2:  Is there anything else?

418
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:54,075
Speaker 4:  Yeah, there's an original from Software Game, which is the

419
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,995
Speaker 4:  student that makes Elvin Ring and Dark Souls and all that stuff like exclusive

420
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:01,745
Speaker 4:  to the Switch too. And I think like that is a

421
00:25:01,745 --> 00:25:04,665
Speaker 4:  wild thing to just like say out loud that they're making a game exclusive

422
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:08,545
Speaker 4:  for the Switch two in addition to like putting Elden ring on it. And I think

423
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:11,425
Speaker 4:  actually both of those, like I think Elden ring's a very, very good technical

424
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:15,305
Speaker 4:  test, but I think a game that only exists on the Switch two from that

425
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,705
Speaker 4:  studio, which is like the most hardcore of, you know,

426
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:22,705
Speaker 4:  big game studios will be like a, a really good sign

427
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:26,785
Speaker 4:  if it's good that, you know, 'cause that's, that's

428
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:29,865
Speaker 4:  obviously third party game support has always been like a place that Nintendo

429
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:32,825
Speaker 4:  has struggled with and there's lots of cool stuff we're talking about at

430
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:36,655
Speaker 4:  Launch here, but they're all, they exist elsewhere. You know, split

431
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:40,495
Speaker 4:  fiction, cyberpunk Straight Fire Six are all games I can play on my

432
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:44,095
Speaker 4:  PlayStation. And So I think showing something that is only on the switch

433
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:47,815
Speaker 4:  to from a studio like that is like a real statement of intent

434
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:50,655
Speaker 4:  as long as it, you know, is good.

435
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:54,415
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well and to that point actually, I think one of the things I've been

436
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:57,575
Speaker 2:  trying to figure out with the switch to kind of throughout this whole launch

437
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,855
Speaker 2:  process is whether it is more

438
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:05,095
Speaker 2:  directly in competition with the Xbox and PlayStation than it has been before.

439
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:08,295
Speaker 2:  'cause I think, and we've talked about this over the years, like there's,

440
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:11,775
Speaker 2:  there's the Xbox and the PlayStation which are kind of playing the same game,

441
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:15,015
Speaker 2:  so to speak, right? And then Nintendo has just always been over here And

442
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:18,575
Speaker 2:  I think most people thinking about what console to buy are

443
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:22,735
Speaker 2:  probably not debating do I buy a PlayStation or do I buy a switch?

444
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:26,775
Speaker 2:  Right? Like you, you, you, you either use them in complimentary ways or you

445
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:30,055
Speaker 2:  kind of are one or the other. But it feels like, again, especially with a

446
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,935
Speaker 2:  lot of the games you're talking about now, coming to the Switch two, which

447
00:26:33,995 --> 00:26:37,535
Speaker 2:  has this huge performance increase, it can do all this other stuff. It is

448
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:41,215
Speaker 2:  getting like split fiction is is a good example. That's the kind of game

449
00:26:41,215 --> 00:26:44,885
Speaker 2:  that I don't think I would've expected on the switch the first go round.

450
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,005
Speaker 2:  But now it's here and we're gonna get these other AAA games and this stuff

451
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:51,805
Speaker 2:  is gonna start to be big. Like, do you think the Switch too is more

452
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:55,765
Speaker 2:  sort of next to the Xbox and PlayStation than Nintendo

453
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:56,405
Speaker 2:  has been in the past?

454
00:26:57,085 --> 00:27:00,765
Speaker 4:  I mean, it is at the moment, but even the games we're talking about again,

455
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:04,685
Speaker 4:  they're like not new. You know, GTA six isn't coming to

456
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:07,605
Speaker 4:  the Switch too. I can say that pretty confidently.

457
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:09,085
Speaker 4:  That's

458
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:11,205
Speaker 2:  Actually a big deal. I had not thought about that until you just said that,

459
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:14,085
Speaker 2:  But that is, that is a meaningful immediate difference. Yeah,

460
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,885
Speaker 4:  I think, I think this is like a thing that actually happens a lot with antenna

461
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,365
Speaker 4:  consoles at Launch where they like get a bunch of third party developers

462
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:23,245
Speaker 4:  to make games for them or like ports of games that exist already

463
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,965
Speaker 4:  and they look great. But what'll like, shorten that gap is like shortening

464
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:31,885
Speaker 4:  the time between when these games are actually on the switch. You know, when

465
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:34,725
Speaker 4:  does Cyberpunk come out? Like three years ago? And that's like a showcase,

466
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:38,845
Speaker 4:  technical showcase for a Nintendo's new console. Right? Yeah. Fair. Which,

467
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:43,035
Speaker 4:  you know, it's, it's great, but like the Witcher four is probably not

468
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:46,915
Speaker 4:  gonna be like launch initially on the Switch too. It'll

469
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:50,155
Speaker 4:  be some sort of weird cloud game three years later.

470
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:55,795
Speaker 4:  So I think it's like maybe closer than it's ever been, but there's still

471
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:57,395
Speaker 4:  like a definite gap there.

472
00:27:57,865 --> 00:28:00,875
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah. So you're still, you're still buying this thing because you wanna

473
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:04,555
Speaker 2:  play Mario Kart, not because you're excited to play the best

474
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:07,595
Speaker 2:  new high-end games from studios around the industry.

475
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,715
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's like a, it's like a bonus. Yeah. That you get to do those other

476
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:11,635
Speaker 4:  things. Yeah.

477
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:15,635
Speaker 2:  That makes sense. Have you done any of the like retro game QB stuff? I,

478
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,675
Speaker 2:  I realized this morning that that's a part of this I have not dug into at

479
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:20,635
Speaker 2:  all. How is, how is that side of things? I

480
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:23,035
Speaker 4:  Mean they're, they're they're getting Q capes, they're great. That is like

481
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:27,435
Speaker 4:  the most unheralded Nintendo console. Yeah. It's like they have like

482
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:31,235
Speaker 4:  a great selection. F zero is like the fastest

483
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:32,875
Speaker 4:  racing game and

484
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:36,315
Speaker 2:  Shocking amount of enthusiasm in our comments for Yeah. For F zero.

485
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,235
Speaker 4:  Well it's also like Nintendo, it's forgotten it existed except for a weird

486
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:44,075
Speaker 4:  offshoot that's like Battle Royal. Yeah. Like wind

487
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,955
Speaker 4:  waker obviously rules and people finally respect that it looks

488
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:51,355
Speaker 4:  good. And so Caliber was like such a weird

489
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:55,995
Speaker 4:  fighting game where they put link in it. So I, I I think the game queue

490
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:58,715
Speaker 4:  games look great. I do think it's a little weird that it's like a switch

491
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:02,235
Speaker 4:  to exclusive thing. I guess I get it's a reason to sell, but I don't see

492
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,475
Speaker 4:  why those games couldn't run on a switch.

493
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,595
Speaker 2:  I also just find it very funny as a marketing exercise. Yeah. To be like,

494
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:11,355
Speaker 2:  Hey, the reason to buy our new console is to buy, is to play games from our

495
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:14,675
Speaker 2:  decades old console that most people don't think about that much anymore.

496
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:18,475
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then barely sold as well. Yeah. But you know, if they put

497
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:20,835
Speaker 4:  double dash on there, then it's all worth it.

498
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:25,475
Speaker 2:  I do it. Nothing would be funnier than Double Dash being

499
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:28,235
Speaker 2:  like a bigger hit than Mario Kart world that everybody's like, actually all

500
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:31,555
Speaker 2:  I want is double Dash we're good. Forget the rest of this Open world stuff.

501
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:31,955
Speaker 2:  If

502
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:34,955
Speaker 4:  They could add like a double dash moat to world, that would be, that would

503
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:38,875
Speaker 4:  actually, I would redo my That's a great idea. Best Mario Card ever headline

504
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:39,115
Speaker 4:  for this.

505
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:42,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that is a very good idea. So, all right, so last question and then

506
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:46,285
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna let you go. I think the, the big open question, I think of

507
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,845
Speaker 2:  the switch to, and this seems to be kinda the overall reaction is not like,

508
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:53,645
Speaker 2:  is it, is it a good console or is it better than the switch? Like I think

509
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:57,295
Speaker 2:  we, we both sort of figured it would be, and it seems like it pretty clearly

510
00:29:57,355 --> 00:30:01,215
Speaker 2:  is it's the price, right? It's the, it's the, is this

511
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:05,175
Speaker 2:  thing worth 450 or $500 depending on which version of it

512
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:05,535
Speaker 2:  you buy?

513
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:11,055
Speaker 2:  How, how easy or hard have you found it to reckon with? Like, what is

514
00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:14,895
Speaker 2:  this thing at, you know, the, the $300 it used to be versus the $500 it is

515
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:15,015
Speaker 2:  now?

516
00:30:15,895 --> 00:30:19,575
Speaker 4:  I think it depends on how long you've had a switch for.

517
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:23,495
Speaker 4:  Okay. If you bought a switch in 2017, then like it makes so much sense.

518
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:27,495
Speaker 4:  Like you need a new one. It's like you, this thing has been chugging

519
00:30:28,155 --> 00:30:31,935
Speaker 4:  and it's a little bit more, but like, what's your other option? Like

520
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,255
Speaker 4:  you want to stay in this ecosystem. It makes a lot of sense. If I had just

521
00:30:35,255 --> 00:30:38,535
Speaker 4:  bought a, like an ol lead last year, then I probably would not wanna upgrade.

522
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:43,255
Speaker 4:  Or I would wait until, you know, a few of those games actually come out

523
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:47,695
Speaker 4:  and you know, they sold out of them mostly. Yeah. It's

524
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:50,215
Speaker 4:  like doing really well. So I think, I think that's the case for a lot of

525
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:54,175
Speaker 4:  people, but I think Nintendo was also happy for that person

526
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:58,135
Speaker 4:  to have bought us last year and then wait three years and buy the

527
00:30:58,295 --> 00:31:02,135
Speaker 4:  ole Switch too. So it's expensive. I'm glad they didn't go up

528
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:05,975
Speaker 4:  further after all that nonsense happened. Yeah. The day that

529
00:31:05,975 --> 00:31:09,095
Speaker 4:  they showed off their console, which is pretty wild. But

530
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,135
Speaker 2:  It could have gotten truly ugly Yeah. There for a while. Yeah.

531
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:15,855
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The timing of it isn't great, but I do think, you know, it

532
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:19,695
Speaker 4:  doesn't seem to be an issue that is like really stunting its growth

533
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:21,055
Speaker 4:  at least initially.

534
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:25,535
Speaker 2:  Yeah, fair enough. Yeah. I think the the like would it be nice if it were

535
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:29,455
Speaker 2:  cheaper? Of course. But I also think it seems increasingly like this

536
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:33,255
Speaker 2:  is just what these things cost. Like are we right to be mad

537
00:31:33,255 --> 00:31:37,175
Speaker 2:  that games are starting to cost $80? Yes, of course. Absolutely. I

538
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:39,855
Speaker 2:  don't think it's gonna change the fact that games are $80. Yeah.

539
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:43,495
Speaker 4:  It's also, you know, like $110 Canadian, so it's much worse here.

540
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:47,375
Speaker 2:  That's true. Fair enough. All right, Andrew,

541
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:50,815
Speaker 2:  congrats on finally finishing this thing. I'm assuming this means you're

542
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:54,535
Speaker 2:  never gonna play the switch to again. You're, you're done. No more, no more

543
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:56,935
Speaker 2:  games for Andrew. I mean, this is the end of your switch to a journey.

544
00:31:57,535 --> 00:32:01,455
Speaker 4:  I am just going to disappear into no Man's Sky as soon as this

545
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:02,095
Speaker 4:  thing is done with.

546
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:05,535
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Which is now you get to go do that for fun instead of for journalism.

547
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:06,975
Speaker 2:  Yes. 'cause our jobs are very weird.

548
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:07,535
Speaker 4:  Exactly.

549
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:28,915
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Ash Parish is here. Hi Ash.

550
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:29,435
Speaker 5:  Hi.

551
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:30,755
Speaker 2:  From your childhood home.

552
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:34,915
Speaker 5:  Yes. This is where Baby Ash grew up from when I was

553
00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:38,715
Speaker 5:  about 16 to when I was about 19. So maybe not that

554
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:42,275
Speaker 5:  long. Love this for you. But we've had this house for like 20

555
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:43,595
Speaker 5:  plus years now. So

556
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:46,515
Speaker 2:  The most important question I have for you is, did you bring the switch with

557
00:33:46,515 --> 00:33:46,595
Speaker 2:  you?

558
00:33:46,915 --> 00:33:50,555
Speaker 5:  I absolutely did. A funny story about that is I went to the

559
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:54,595
Speaker 5:  midnight release of the Switch. I went to a physical GameStop to pick it

560
00:33:54,595 --> 00:33:58,395
Speaker 5:  up and immediately after I got my switch I got on the road

561
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:02,395
Speaker 5:  and drove to Indiana. That's a five hour ride if

562
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:06,155
Speaker 5:  you're, you know, driving kind of fast. So I could

563
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:09,875
Speaker 5:  leave my dog with his grandmother while I went to Summer

564
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:13,595
Speaker 5:  Games Fest. But I had the switch with me. That was a long day. That was a

565
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:14,195
Speaker 5:  very long day.

566
00:34:14,225 --> 00:34:18,065
Speaker 2:  That is a long day. So you've actually had, I would say like the the

567
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:21,785
Speaker 2:  sort of ideal potential switch experience already,

568
00:34:21,785 --> 00:34:25,105
Speaker 2:  which is you've gotten to play it in a bunch of places. The the, like the

569
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,785
Speaker 2:  whole idea of this thing right is it's supposed to be equally at home, like

570
00:34:27,785 --> 00:34:31,665
Speaker 2:  on a, on a big screen in your living room or like on the go in a

571
00:34:31,665 --> 00:34:35,585
Speaker 2:  hotel room or wherever. How I have not traveled with this

572
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:39,345
Speaker 2:  thing at all yet. It has sat in its dock right there next to me every single

573
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:41,625
Speaker 2:  second I have owned it. So how does this thing travel

574
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:45,505
Speaker 5:  So it travels well with one big caveat.

575
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:50,385
Speaker 5:  First of all, I feel like I'd need a traveling case for this, which is not

576
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:53,345
Speaker 5:  something that I felt like I needed with my regular switch. I'll throw that

577
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:56,585
Speaker 5:  in the bag and keep it going and I've never had any issues. But one thing

578
00:34:56,585 --> 00:35:00,385
Speaker 5:  I've, I've noticed with the switch too is like I put it in my, my

579
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:04,265
Speaker 5:  carry-on bag And I feel like I, I get this nervous feeling like I should

580
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:08,185
Speaker 5:  be protecting this. And I, when I pulled it out of

581
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:11,745
Speaker 5:  my bag to play it on the plane, I noticed that the left JoyCon

582
00:35:11,765 --> 00:35:15,745
Speaker 5:  thumbs stick was not as responsive as I was used to

583
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:18,945
Speaker 5:  it being. And the right one was a little bit more responsive And I think

584
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:22,505
Speaker 5:  it may have gotten jostled or squished where the, the JoyCon may have gotten

585
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:26,265
Speaker 5:  pressed in. I managed to work it out, so it feels fine now, but I'm like,

586
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:29,185
Speaker 5:  okay, yeah, this we, we need some kind of protection because I just can't

587
00:35:29,185 --> 00:35:32,985
Speaker 5:  have this out raw dogging life. Other than that,

588
00:35:33,055 --> 00:35:36,905
Speaker 5:  like it's really good. I had took a picture and

589
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:40,725
Speaker 5:  I'll, and I'll put this in my blog that I write about how this switch travels

590
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:44,285
Speaker 5:  of it, sitting with the little kickstand on

591
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:48,445
Speaker 5:  those tray tables on a plane and just like sitting with it, holding it like

592
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:51,685
Speaker 5:  that. Like I thought that felt really good and I've never used, you're not

593
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:54,645
Speaker 5:  able to really do that with the original switch because the kickstand is

594
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:56,285
Speaker 5:  so thin and flimsy.

595
00:35:56,515 --> 00:35:59,125
Speaker 2:  It's awful. That's, that's the word you're looking for. It's, it's awful.

596
00:35:59,555 --> 00:35:59,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

597
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:03,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is the whole thing on the switch. It goes for the

598
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:06,805
Speaker 5:  kickstand, it goes all the way across the body of the switch and it's very

599
00:36:06,935 --> 00:36:10,845
Speaker 5:  tight when you like adjust it and that feels really good. So I'm sitting

600
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:14,845
Speaker 5:  on this plane, it, the kickstand is up like the, are still attached

601
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:18,405
Speaker 5:  to the unit and I'm holding it in my lap or like on this desktop thing. And

602
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:20,765
Speaker 5:  it actually felt really comfortable And I really, I really like that. I'll,

603
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:24,525
Speaker 5:  I'll have a picture for you. The battery life kind of leaves

604
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:28,405
Speaker 5:  a lot to be desired. I did see that Nintendo put out a statement that,

605
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:31,605
Speaker 5:  you know, it may just be, you may just be a glitch. I don't know about that,

606
00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:36,085
Speaker 5:  but I noticed that it seems to draw a lot of power when it's

607
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:40,005
Speaker 5:  in idle mode. Mm. But it, I haven't really used it all that much

608
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:43,765
Speaker 5:  while I was at Summer Games Fest. I pulled it out a couple times to play

609
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:46,645
Speaker 5:  like when I was in my hotel room or I hadn't plugged it in And I noticed

610
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:50,485
Speaker 5:  that the battery life kind of drained even though it hadn't been like

611
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:54,405
Speaker 5:  on, on a lot. And I was really like, oh that's, that's different. I'm not

612
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:57,245
Speaker 5:  used to it. Kind of like degrading over time like that even though I hadn't

613
00:36:57,245 --> 00:37:00,765
Speaker 5:  been using it. And the big thing, the the, the

614
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:04,525
Speaker 5:  glaring issue for me is that it does not pair with my

615
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:07,685
Speaker 5:  Bluetooth headphones. I have a pair of JVC just like

616
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:11,765
Speaker 5:  cheapo headphones that kind of like hang around my neck. They're like wireless

617
00:37:12,395 --> 00:37:16,125
Speaker 5:  earbuds but they don't pair, I don't know why. I've tried in all different

618
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:19,245
Speaker 5:  kinds of configurations. My earbuds work with everything else.

619
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:23,845
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna test it with my mom's EarPods later to see if it's just a

620
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:27,725
Speaker 5:  me issue or if it's like a thing or it's just a my switch

621
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:30,685
Speaker 5:  issue. I don't know. But I was really looking forward to being able to like

622
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:34,645
Speaker 5:  listen to the music. 'cause I was playing a hundred line last Defense Academy

623
00:37:34,705 --> 00:37:38,165
Speaker 5:  on the plane And I was really looking forward to like being able to, you

624
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:41,925
Speaker 5:  know, use my earphones with it And I couldn't. And I was really upset about

625
00:37:41,925 --> 00:37:45,845
Speaker 5:  this. So hopefully it's just like a me issue and not a switch

626
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:46,165
Speaker 5:  issue.

627
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:50,565
Speaker 2:  There are some really weird connection limitations I've

628
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:53,365
Speaker 2:  discovered on this thing that are the sort of thing that's like

629
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:58,405
Speaker 2:  probably fine in, you know, actual use. Like the,

630
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:02,165
Speaker 2:  the thing where you can only have two wireless controllers connected at a

631
00:38:02,165 --> 00:38:05,405
Speaker 2:  time, but, but a pair of joy cons counts as two.

632
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:06,605
Speaker 2:  So it's just like,

633
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,805
Speaker 5:  Oh that's weird. It's,

634
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,805
Speaker 2:  It's super weird. It's weird. And, and the reality of it is like, okay, what

635
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:13,925
Speaker 2:  are the odds you're likely to be, have to have both a pair of joy cons and

636
00:38:13,965 --> 00:38:16,645
Speaker 2:  a separate controller that you all wanna use wirelessly all at the same time.

637
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:21,365
Speaker 2:  Probably relatively small but not zero and it's not like a hard technology

638
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,245
Speaker 2:  problem to solve.

639
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:26,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. One thing I will, that I just remembered, I

640
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:30,685
Speaker 5:  remember seeing that the, the switch had two USBC ports And

641
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:34,525
Speaker 5:  I was like, well why do we need two? And I real, I found the use case

642
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:37,845
Speaker 5:  for the two two. So because the battery was having such an issue, I had a

643
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:41,045
Speaker 5:  battery pack with me and because it wasn't picking up my

644
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:45,285
Speaker 5:  earbuds, I had some earphones that take A-U-S-B-C connection.

645
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:49,045
Speaker 5:  I was able to plug in the charger on the bottom and then plug in my headphones

646
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:52,565
Speaker 5:  on the top And I'm like, ah, that's smart. Because if I did, if it only had

647
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:56,245
Speaker 5:  the one I, I would have to choose between either listening or charging the

648
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:58,605
Speaker 5:  thing. So I thought that was actually okay. Nintendo, you got me on that

649
00:38:58,605 --> 00:38:58,725
Speaker 5:  one.

650
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:01,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's, that's pretty good. That is, that is something. So one other

651
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:05,045
Speaker 2:  travel question. Yeah. And then I'll move on from this. 'cause I think one

652
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:08,725
Speaker 2:  of the things that frustrated me a little bit of the original switch was

653
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:12,405
Speaker 2:  that the, the one of the like canonical ways you're supposed to do it was

654
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:15,125
Speaker 2:  exactly what you're describing, right? You like put prop it up somewhere

655
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:19,205
Speaker 2:  with the, the kickstand out, you take out the joycons, you hold the joycons

656
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:22,205
Speaker 2:  in both hands and you play with it detached that way. And I always felt like

657
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:25,885
Speaker 2:  the switches screen was just, just a little too small. Too small for that

658
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:29,045
Speaker 2:  to work. Yeah. And I know the switch too screen is bigger, but I've only

659
00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:32,325
Speaker 2:  been able to test that in sort of like hokey ways sitting here at my desk.

660
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:36,245
Speaker 2:  Like how does it do on the, like the, the, the thing you just described,

661
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:39,885
Speaker 2:  like I wanna play this sitting in an airplane seat is like the dream. And

662
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:42,765
Speaker 2:  with the original switch it never quite hit for me. Does it work with the

663
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:43,925
Speaker 2:  switch too? Is it bigger enough?

664
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:48,205
Speaker 5:  It is bigger enough. It feels really good. Like

665
00:39:48,205 --> 00:39:51,725
Speaker 5:  even in the hands, like it feels good. Like this feels more natural to me

666
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:54,445
Speaker 5:  than the switch, which kind of like, you're kind of close like this because

667
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:57,565
Speaker 5:  it is so small. But this, you're able to like relax a little bit and like,

668
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:00,845
Speaker 5:  you know, take that tension outta your shoulders as you play. And that makes

669
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:04,925
Speaker 5:  a big difference. I really enjoy that part. I haven't yet tested

670
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:08,685
Speaker 5:  it where I've got 'em, the two joy con slotted into the controller and then

671
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:12,125
Speaker 5:  like the switches away from me from a distance. But I plan on testing that

672
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:16,085
Speaker 5:  later when I try teaching my mom how to play with the switch too, to see

673
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:19,805
Speaker 5:  nice, you know, how accessible family wise the system

674
00:40:19,905 --> 00:40:23,645
Speaker 5:  is. But yeah, I I think it'll be good. I think it'll be really good.

675
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:27,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's, that's very exciting. I think that just adding that next thing

676
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:31,445
Speaker 2:  goes a long way for me. So what have you been playing? I think you're,

677
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:34,565
Speaker 2:  you're, you've been testing this thing like you, you were one of the first

678
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,605
Speaker 2:  people on our team to get a hands on with it in particular. You've like covered

679
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:40,485
Speaker 2:  all the games. What, what was like the first stuff you dove into when you

680
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:41,525
Speaker 2:  got your switch to Mario

681
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:45,725
Speaker 5:  Kart? Well, baby, like one of the things that I really was trying to

682
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:49,045
Speaker 5:  get going at Summer Games Fest was to get a bunch of people

683
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:53,445
Speaker 5:  like, you know, my colleagues at other outlets, we've all are trying our

684
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:56,205
Speaker 5:  best to get a switch to some of 'em had it delivered so they didn't have

685
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:59,165
Speaker 5:  'em with them, but some of them had them with them and just get together

686
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:03,045
Speaker 5:  this big Mario cart knockout tournament going and it just, we couldn't

687
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:07,005
Speaker 5:  make it work unfortunately. But Mario Kart is so

688
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:10,805
Speaker 5:  much fun to play on the Switch too. Like, I'm

689
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:14,685
Speaker 5:  not a Mario Kart person. I'm really not an online gamer

690
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,885
Speaker 5:  person, like multiplayer gamer, just, I just don't do that. But playing

691
00:41:18,285 --> 00:41:21,965
Speaker 5:  Knockout Online was like the first thing I did when I turned on the system

692
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:25,365
Speaker 5:  and it was so much fun. Even though I lost pretty badly,

693
00:41:26,255 --> 00:41:30,085
Speaker 5:  those people are no joke. I've also been playing, but

694
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:33,240
Speaker 5:  that's like the only like new certified switch two game that I had had. I

695
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,740
Speaker 5:  So on that

696
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,125
Speaker 2:  Front Yeah, go ahead. Before I, I'm curious like what, what do you make of

697
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:40,045
Speaker 2:  this like gentle backlash there has been to Mario Kart world being like

698
00:41:40,185 --> 00:41:44,085
Speaker 2:  the launch title? I feel like the thing that I've heard, the sort of

699
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:47,645
Speaker 2:  most negative piece of, of reaction I've seen to all of the Switch stuff

700
00:41:47,645 --> 00:41:50,885
Speaker 2:  is the like, oh, it's just a better switch, which we can come back to. But

701
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:53,965
Speaker 2:  I find completely ridiculous because that is exactly what I wanted. Hooray.

702
00:41:53,995 --> 00:41:57,445
Speaker 2:  It's a better switch. But there is this thing where it's like people don't

703
00:41:57,445 --> 00:42:01,165
Speaker 2:  think Mario Kart World is enough to be this sort of launch title

704
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:03,765
Speaker 2:  for a new console. What do you, what do you make of that?

705
00:42:04,045 --> 00:42:07,805
Speaker 5:  I honestly, I feel it. I really do. Yeah. Because when you're on a plane,

706
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:11,365
Speaker 5:  right, the most fun part about Mario Kart is the ability to play

707
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:15,085
Speaker 5:  online with other people, right. When you're on a plane, you know, you don't

708
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:17,405
Speaker 5:  really have that. I mean, you could pay for wifi if you want and try to,

709
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:19,805
Speaker 5:  you know, do it that way, which I don't know why you would do that. Yeah.

710
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:22,725
Speaker 5:  Gotta help you. So I'm on plane help in this like, you know, bubble and I'm

711
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:26,005
Speaker 5:  like, damn, I wish I had like a chunky 60 hour RPG that I could play right

712
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:29,925
Speaker 5:  now. Which is why I turned, I didn't play Mario Kart And I turned back on

713
00:42:30,045 --> 00:42:33,565
Speaker 5:  a hundred Line last Defense Academy, which is like this dang ropa like

714
00:42:33,605 --> 00:42:37,045
Speaker 5:  RPG kind of thing because that's, that's what I wanted in that situation.

715
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:39,645
Speaker 5:  And there was just nothing there that could like scratch that itch because

716
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:43,085
Speaker 5:  I've already played the Zelda, I don't wanna play it again. I know that it

717
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:46,885
Speaker 5:  looks really beautiful. Like it looks like it was supposed to, you know,

718
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:50,085
Speaker 5:  all those years ago. Like now I don't wanna do that again. I don't wanna

719
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:53,245
Speaker 5:  rehash that. I want something new. And I really wish that there was some

720
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:57,245
Speaker 5:  kind of, I don't know, like Mario hint, hint that I

721
00:42:57,245 --> 00:43:01,165
Speaker 5:  could have been playing while I was, you know, with no internet signal. Otherwise

722
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:03,005
Speaker 5:  I would've been playing Mario Kart. So

723
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:05,605
Speaker 2:  You that's a really interesting point. I hadn't even really thought about

724
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:09,445
Speaker 2:  that. That like, for all that there is to do in Mario

725
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:13,645
Speaker 2:  Kart world, it doesn't feel like that big a game.

726
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:17,325
Speaker 2:  Like it's very fun And I will play a ton of it, but it doesn't feel

727
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:21,885
Speaker 2:  sort of epic in scope. The way a lot of these like launch like Breath of

728
00:43:21,885 --> 00:43:25,645
Speaker 2:  the Wild was a perfect example. It was like nobody could believe how epic

729
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:29,645
Speaker 2:  in scope that game was at the time. And so maybe, maybe the expectations

730
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:33,165
Speaker 2:  for like, it, it doesn't just have to be a game that's fun that I'm going

731
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:36,485
Speaker 2:  to play a lot. It has to like, you want something that sort of, you wanna

732
00:43:36,485 --> 00:43:38,525
Speaker 2:  make a statement feels demonstrably different. Yeah. Yeah.

733
00:43:38,555 --> 00:43:42,005
Speaker 5:  This, that's fair. This is a, it's a nice statement, it's an okay statement.

734
00:43:42,075 --> 00:43:45,525
Speaker 5:  It's a fun statement, but it's not like the kind of statement that you should

735
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:48,045
Speaker 5:  be punching people in the face with with the launch of your new console.

736
00:43:48,055 --> 00:43:51,405
Speaker 5:  Right. When I pre-order my Switch, I also put a pre-order for Donkey Kong

737
00:43:51,405 --> 00:43:54,725
Speaker 5:  Bonanza because for some reason I thought that would be a, a launch title

738
00:43:54,725 --> 00:43:57,445
Speaker 5:  because if it was like we wouldn't, we would have be having a totally different

739
00:43:57,445 --> 00:44:00,645
Speaker 5:  conversation. 'cause I would be talking all about Donkey Kong because that

740
00:44:00,645 --> 00:44:04,525
Speaker 5:  was my game of the show damn near when I was

741
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:07,845
Speaker 5:  doing the Switch to experience back in April. Like that was the game I wanted.

742
00:44:07,865 --> 00:44:10,325
Speaker 5:  And I was really disappointed to find out that that wasn't a launch title.

743
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:14,045
Speaker 5:  Like what that would've been the seller. Like that would've been the thing

744
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:16,525
Speaker 5:  that would've been the thing that would've satisfied me on my plane ride.

745
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:18,525
Speaker 5:  But I, I guess I have to wait for that.

746
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:22,885
Speaker 2:  I know, I, I was a little surprised because they even set that one up like

747
00:44:22,885 --> 00:44:26,005
Speaker 2:  it was going to be Yeah, yeah. The one like you And I talked After that,

748
00:44:26,115 --> 00:44:29,605
Speaker 2:  that Nintendo direct and it was like, okay, this is the game

749
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:30,605
Speaker 2:  for this console.

750
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:34,125
Speaker 5:  So I guess we have to wait a little bit, but yeah. Yeah, I guess that's,

751
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:37,005
Speaker 5:  that's what we gotta do. Nintendo does things on their own time and

752
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:40,605
Speaker 5:  we gotta wait for them, let them cook. They usually don't disappoint us.

753
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:42,925
Speaker 5:  So we'll see how it goes when Donkey Kong Bonanza launches.

754
00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:45,885
Speaker 2:  I mean that is true. The, the, they usually don't disappoint us. Thing is

755
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:48,445
Speaker 2:  the only part of me that is like a little willing to be patient is like,

756
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:52,085
Speaker 2:  usually it's worth it. Usually. Yeah. It'll be okay.

757
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:53,325
Speaker 2:  So what else have you been playing?

758
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:58,125
Speaker 5:  So it's just been pretty much those two, believe it or not,

759
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:02,005
Speaker 5:  like when I'm at Summer Games Fest, I don't have a lot of time to play video

760
00:45:02,005 --> 00:45:05,885
Speaker 5:  games because I'm, you know, dodging protests and,

761
00:45:06,265 --> 00:45:08,645
Speaker 5:  you know, going from appointment to appointment to appointment appointment.

762
00:45:08,645 --> 00:45:11,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So I'll have a little downtime at the end of the day and I'm trying

763
00:45:11,205 --> 00:45:15,005
Speaker 5:  to get through this, this RPG 'cause I'm really interested in the story

764
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:17,525
Speaker 5:  and it's, it's kind of fun. But that's pretty much it for right now.

765
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,325
Speaker 2:  What are you, what are you excited to play? What's out that you're like itching

766
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:21,405
Speaker 2:  to get into? Hmm.

767
00:45:21,715 --> 00:45:25,605
Speaker 5:  What is the thing is what is out? Like I do wanna play the

768
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:29,485
Speaker 5:  welcome tour because I saw something in that game. I

769
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:31,005
Speaker 5:  know people right now are, did you ever

770
00:45:31,005 --> 00:45:33,605
Speaker 2:  Think you would say the sentence out loud, no, I wanna play the welcome tour.

771
00:45:33,945 --> 00:45:34,165
Speaker 2:  No,

772
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:37,565
Speaker 5:  I didn't. But there was something that I saw that like sparked an interest

773
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:41,125
Speaker 5:  in me when at the switch to experience that is like, I wanna learn more about

774
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:44,765
Speaker 5:  this device in my hands. And I think that was a good way to, to

775
00:45:45,065 --> 00:45:48,845
Speaker 5:  impart that information. Like there's this thing where it teaches you about

776
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:52,765
Speaker 5:  like HDR and like frame rates. Like yes I know what a frame rates

777
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:56,565
Speaker 5:  is And I know what happens when frame rates are low, but I never really

778
00:45:56,565 --> 00:46:00,445
Speaker 5:  understood the technical details behind like frame rates and why things

779
00:46:00,445 --> 00:46:03,845
Speaker 5:  appear differently. And welcome Tour got into that And I was like, oh, that's

780
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:06,805
Speaker 5:  interesting. I could learn some things that I didn't already know about this

781
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:10,605
Speaker 5:  And I don't have that game yet and that's on my list of things to do. Maybe

782
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:13,205
Speaker 5:  I'll go download it after I'm done talking with you So I can talk more about

783
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:17,005
Speaker 5:  it. But I was really interested in that. I, And I like those little mini

784
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:19,605
Speaker 5:  games, like those little warrior aware esque mini games. I think they could

785
00:46:19,605 --> 00:46:23,445
Speaker 5:  be really fun and a really nice way to introduce the switch

786
00:46:23,445 --> 00:46:26,605
Speaker 5:  to my mom. So yeah, I think that is what I'm gonna do when I get off the

787
00:46:26,605 --> 00:46:29,725
Speaker 5:  call with you. That's the game we'll play together instead of animal crossing.

788
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:34,005
Speaker 5:  Oh, And I did transfer my animal crossing island over from my switch

789
00:46:34,005 --> 00:46:36,805
Speaker 5:  one to my switch two to see how easy that was. And that was a relatively

790
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:40,365
Speaker 5:  seamless experience. So people who are really precious about their animal

791
00:46:40,605 --> 00:46:43,765
Speaker 5:  crossing islands, don't worry, you can save all your stuff. It's not a big

792
00:46:43,765 --> 00:46:43,965
Speaker 5:  hassle.

793
00:46:44,645 --> 00:46:47,725
Speaker 2:  I will say that was one of the things I was most pleasantly surprised by

794
00:46:47,825 --> 00:46:51,245
Speaker 2:  was how easy it was to go from switch one to switch two.

795
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:55,485
Speaker 2:  Mine was slightly messy because I have it as it turns out, two Nintendo accounts

796
00:46:55,485 --> 00:46:58,805
Speaker 2:  with the same email address. Oof. Which just breaks everything. I don't even

797
00:46:58,805 --> 00:47:02,725
Speaker 2:  know how that happened, but I was, it was just a mess. But once I, once I

798
00:47:02,725 --> 00:47:05,765
Speaker 2:  sorted that out, it was like, it's like a 10 minute process. All my stuff

799
00:47:05,765 --> 00:47:09,445
Speaker 2:  got moved over and it was like I haven't had to touch my original switch

800
00:47:09,495 --> 00:47:10,885
Speaker 2:  since, which has been awesome.

801
00:47:11,155 --> 00:47:11,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

802
00:47:11,835 --> 00:47:15,605
Speaker 2:  Very surprised by that. What do you, what's your sense of

803
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:20,725
Speaker 2:  sort of where on the spectrum this goes between like slightly better switch?

804
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:24,325
Speaker 2:  I barely even notice a difference all the way to like complete

805
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:28,045
Speaker 2:  brand new Nintendo console generation.

806
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:31,685
Speaker 5:  I'm kind kind of in the middle because of the situation we talked about before,

807
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:35,485
Speaker 5:  which is the games. Like, okay, if I had more games that

808
00:47:35,505 --> 00:47:39,285
Speaker 5:  are not just ports from the switch one to the switch two, like more original

809
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:42,045
Speaker 5:  games to play, I think we would be having a different conversation. But there

810
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:45,725
Speaker 5:  aren't that many Switch two exclusives out right now. Right? There's Delta

811
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,725
Speaker 5:  Run, but I gotta be honest, like I was an under tail girly. I was not a Delta

812
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:53,205
Speaker 5:  in person. I know that people are freaking out and having a really great

813
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:56,285
Speaker 5:  time with the new chapters that were released with the switch to, but even

814
00:47:56,285 --> 00:47:59,885
Speaker 5:  then, that doesn't feel like a switch, an exclusively

815
00:48:00,205 --> 00:48:03,045
Speaker 5:  switched to experience that's, you know, it's gonna be on both consoles.

816
00:48:03,545 --> 00:48:07,205
Speaker 5:  So I, I'm, I'm waiting for the games man. Like

817
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:11,525
Speaker 5:  when the games I think will tell me what, or how much more

818
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:15,605
Speaker 5:  powerful this system is. And until then, you know, we're, we're just

819
00:48:15,605 --> 00:48:19,485
Speaker 5:  dealing with the cool camera and the voice chat and

820
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:23,445
Speaker 5:  you know, trying to see how many different kinds of camera inputs the switch

821
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:26,925
Speaker 5:  can take, which I've seen people are my colleagues in Slack, like, you know,

822
00:48:26,925 --> 00:48:30,805
Speaker 5:  connecting their weird cameras to it and whatever. And that's fun. Almost

823
00:48:30,805 --> 00:48:34,645
Speaker 5:  bought one myself And I didn't, but we'll see. It looks like, and

824
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,485
Speaker 5:  from what I've heard from other people, the camera really enhances things,

825
00:48:37,485 --> 00:48:41,165
Speaker 5:  especially Mario Cart because you can see your friend's face, it gives you

826
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:43,965
Speaker 2:  Like, it's pretty fun. The thing where it's like their, their little head

827
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:46,045
Speaker 2:  sort of bobbing above the car is pretty great.

828
00:48:46,175 --> 00:48:49,685
Speaker 5:  Gives it a little, I don't know, an extra as a qua that

829
00:48:49,765 --> 00:48:52,845
Speaker 5:  enhances that fun. But I don't have that stuff yet. We'll wait. Yeah.

830
00:48:52,905 --> 00:48:56,805
Speaker 2:  So what, what do you think will make a switch to game a

831
00:48:56,805 --> 00:49:00,165
Speaker 2:  switch to game this? Because again, if it's, if it's just a slightly better

832
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:04,005
Speaker 2:  switch, there is a world in which the thing that we

833
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:07,925
Speaker 2:  get is slightly better games, right? Everything runs a little faster. I

834
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:10,125
Speaker 2:  mean, this has been my experience so far. It's like the, the single biggest

835
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:14,005
Speaker 2:  upgrade is just that everything is faster. Yes. Which is not

836
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:18,365
Speaker 2:  a $500 upgrade all on its own, but it has been like a real meaningful, like,

837
00:49:18,365 --> 00:49:22,325
Speaker 2:  quality of life improvement in my experience with this console. Every menu

838
00:49:22,345 --> 00:49:25,925
Speaker 2:  is faster, everything loads faster. Like it's, it's just a vastly faster

839
00:49:25,935 --> 00:49:28,725
Speaker 2:  thing. Is it possible that that's

840
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:33,665
Speaker 2:  the extent of it or it is your sense that like from what we've seen from

841
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:37,585
Speaker 2:  games that have and have not launched yet, that there is going to be something

842
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:41,345
Speaker 2:  you can do in these games that feels sort of meaningfully different even

843
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,105
Speaker 2:  from the Switch one?

844
00:49:43,165 --> 00:49:47,025
Speaker 5:  The only answer that I can think of is Nintendo finding a

845
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,825
Speaker 5:  way to hit us in the face with their new JoyCon technology.

846
00:49:51,045 --> 00:49:54,665
Speaker 5:  So like the little mouse thing, like they had drag and drive, which was the

847
00:49:54,665 --> 00:49:58,625
Speaker 5:  three V three wheelchair basketball thing. But that for me left a lot

848
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:02,385
Speaker 5:  to be desired. It was Metro Prime four, which probably will be the game

849
00:50:02,385 --> 00:50:05,705
Speaker 5:  that like makes everybody go, damn, this is a switch too. I didn't really

850
00:50:05,705 --> 00:50:08,945
Speaker 5:  like it all that much. Maybe I need to have more time with it in order to,

851
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:12,465
Speaker 5:  you know, really get in the groove of things because I did not play the first

852
00:50:12,595 --> 00:50:16,505
Speaker 5:  three Metro primes and I'm more of like a side scrolling

853
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:21,105
Speaker 5:  metro girly versus like the first person metro girly. Like I tried to play

854
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:24,305
Speaker 5:  those Metro Prime games and they, when they re-released them on the switch

855
00:50:24,305 --> 00:50:27,885
Speaker 5:  and they kind of just didn't hold me. So I'm hoping that, you know, with

856
00:50:27,885 --> 00:50:31,685
Speaker 5:  more time with Metro Prime four, I can see the vision there, but I'm

857
00:50:31,685 --> 00:50:35,205
Speaker 5:  really waiting, like Nintendo's always done these really cool gimmicky things

858
00:50:35,205 --> 00:50:38,125
Speaker 5:  that yeah, they look silly and whatever, but they also really work. They

859
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:41,605
Speaker 5:  were really fun. Like we had that with the Joycons, with like Nintendo Switch

860
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:45,445
Speaker 5:  Sports and Ring Fit Adventure, those kinds of things. Right. That's what

861
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:48,965
Speaker 5:  makes this console feel different from your Xboxes and your PlayStations.

862
00:50:49,105 --> 00:50:53,085
Speaker 5:  I'm waiting on that, but I am really, I really cannot conceive

863
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:56,565
Speaker 5:  of how they make those mouse controls fun because the little bit I saw of

864
00:50:56,565 --> 00:50:58,405
Speaker 5:  it was not fun for me and kind of painful.

865
00:50:59,075 --> 00:51:02,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. It, it does seem like that thing could be really cool

866
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:07,125
Speaker 2:  or it could be very like Microsoft connecting in that it's

867
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:10,685
Speaker 2:  like a nifty thing that exists in three games. Exactly. And that's fine as

868
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:14,645
Speaker 2:  far as it goes, but it's not, no one's gonna remember the connect

869
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:17,005
Speaker 2:  as like the thing that made the Xbox work. You know what I mean?

870
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:20,885
Speaker 5:  I trust Nintendo's innovation a little bit more than I trust

871
00:51:21,885 --> 00:51:25,765
Speaker 5:  Microsoft's and PlayStations, which makes me sound like one of those, like

872
00:51:25,765 --> 00:51:29,525
Speaker 5:  Nintendo fanboy per people. I am not, I am platform

873
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:33,205
Speaker 5:  agnostic. Can I take it with me on the go? Yes. Okay. I'm in.

874
00:51:33,475 --> 00:51:35,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's a good segue, David.

875
00:51:36,515 --> 00:51:40,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Wait, last thing I, I am curious about your controller setup.

876
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:45,325
Speaker 2:  I just bought a pro controller for the Switch two and I'm feeling

877
00:51:45,365 --> 00:51:48,925
Speaker 2:  a lot of feelings about it because it's very good and it was also $85 and

878
00:51:48,925 --> 00:51:52,605
Speaker 2:  that fills me with rage. Every time I look at it. I What's your, what's your

879
00:51:52,605 --> 00:51:52,805
Speaker 2:  setup?

880
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:57,085
Speaker 5:  My setup is I have not put this thing in a dock yet. 'cause I don't particularly

881
00:51:57,115 --> 00:52:00,205
Speaker 5:  care about it. That's not how I play these games. That's not how I used my

882
00:52:00,205 --> 00:52:04,085
Speaker 5:  switch one either. This was in my hand, in my lap at all times. Okay. And

883
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:06,925
Speaker 5:  I am very satisfied with that experience so far. Yeah.

884
00:52:07,045 --> 00:52:07,765
Speaker 2:  I, I buy that

885
00:52:08,085 --> 00:52:12,005
Speaker 5:  I will try it for sake of, you know, whatever, to have something to

886
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:14,565
Speaker 5:  compare it a against, but like, I just don't care. Yeah.

887
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:18,125
Speaker 2:  And you haven't found it like heavy or bulky? I think I've seen a surprising

888
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:21,725
Speaker 2:  number of people be like, this thing is enormous And I, I mean at least to

889
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:22,605
Speaker 2:  me that has not felt true.

890
00:52:23,065 --> 00:52:26,845
Speaker 5:  No, it's pretty much the same. It's a same profile as

891
00:52:26,905 --> 00:52:30,765
Speaker 5:  the, the Steam Deck to me with like, it's thinner so it feels

892
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:33,565
Speaker 5:  better in the hand. It doesn't like give me claw hand the same way the the

893
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:37,245
Speaker 5:  Steam Deck does because your hands are in this like weird, they can't quite

894
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:40,685
Speaker 5:  close like this like they would around a, a controller, nor are they like

895
00:52:40,685 --> 00:52:43,765
Speaker 5:  this where they're more relaxed. It's just like this middle part that makes

896
00:52:43,825 --> 00:52:47,685
Speaker 5:  me, you know, my hands cramp up. I hate it, but it feels really natural

897
00:52:47,785 --> 00:52:50,925
Speaker 5:  in my hands. It feels, it feels like it should have because like I can, you

898
00:52:50,925 --> 00:52:54,485
Speaker 5:  know, stretch out my shoulders and relax versus being real close when you

899
00:52:54,485 --> 00:52:56,565
Speaker 5:  are with the smaller original switch.

900
00:52:57,315 --> 00:53:00,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, I, I, that's definitely been my experience too. The, the little

901
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:04,325
Speaker 2:  bit I've played with is just like sitting on the couch or like up in bed

902
00:53:04,325 --> 00:53:08,245
Speaker 2:  or whatever, like I have not experienced it as heavy once. Yeah. I

903
00:53:08,245 --> 00:53:11,445
Speaker 2:  think part of it is like I do a lot of like lying in bed holding an iPad

904
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:15,325
Speaker 2:  above my face and that I'm constantly worried I'm gonna like drop on my

905
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:18,205
Speaker 2:  head, but this is normally like sitting in my lap and I have my arms propped

906
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:20,765
Speaker 2:  up somewhere. And I don't know, this just doesn't feel like a problem to

907
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:21,405
Speaker 2:  me the same way

908
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:25,365
Speaker 5:  I just had this vision of you of like playing a switch like this and I'm

909
00:53:25,365 --> 00:53:28,285
Speaker 5:  like, I would drop that on my head. I would have like blunt force trauma

910
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:29,285
Speaker 5:  every day if I played.

911
00:53:29,285 --> 00:53:31,965
Speaker 2:  Oh, I have, I have dropped iPads on my face. I like asked. That's terrible.

912
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:34,565
Speaker 2:  iPads plural. I have dropped on my face over years.

913
00:53:34,665 --> 00:53:37,965
Speaker 5:  Oh no, no. And those things are heavy. No, you don't want that going on your

914
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:38,765
Speaker 5:  skull. Yeah,

915
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:42,605
Speaker 2:  It's not, I don't recommend it. It's not a good time. You mentioned the

916
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:46,845
Speaker 2:  Xbox and the, the other handheld news of the week

917
00:53:47,585 --> 00:53:51,485
Speaker 2:  was a new Xbox e handheld console that you

918
00:53:51,485 --> 00:53:55,365
Speaker 2:  also got to try. Yeah. That a bunch of people have sent to me as a like,

919
00:53:56,115 --> 00:53:59,605
Speaker 2:  potentially interesting way. I was on this podcast a while ago being like,

920
00:53:59,605 --> 00:54:03,485
Speaker 2:  dear God, just give me a device I can play FIFA on. And that device

921
00:54:03,485 --> 00:54:05,445
Speaker 2:  eventually became the switch and

922
00:54:07,355 --> 00:54:10,685
Speaker 2:  it's, it's fine. It's not the best version of it, but it's fine. But then

923
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:13,565
Speaker 2:  I look and it's like, oh, we've been waiting for Xbox handhelds for forever.

924
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,085
Speaker 2:  This is kind of maybe starting to happen. It

925
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:20,565
Speaker 5:  Is, it is happening. I, So I was at the Xbox

926
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:24,445
Speaker 5:  event at summer Game Fest. They had hands-on, so

927
00:54:24,985 --> 00:54:28,885
Speaker 5:  it was really a hands-on with gears of War Reloaded. So they're doing

928
00:54:28,885 --> 00:54:32,805
Speaker 5:  another remaster of Gears of War Congratulations. Sure. And they had

929
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:36,325
Speaker 5:  the game on like every different kind of console that it can run so you can

930
00:54:36,325 --> 00:54:39,925
Speaker 5:  compare. So they had it on an Xbox, they had it on a PlayStation, they had

931
00:54:39,925 --> 00:54:43,845
Speaker 5:  it on a pc, they had it on one of the vanilla R

932
00:54:44,105 --> 00:54:46,965
Speaker 5:  allies and then they also had the ROG

933
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:51,725
Speaker 5:  Xbox Ally X, we gotta talk to Microsoft. We

934
00:54:51,725 --> 00:54:55,525
Speaker 5:  gotta sit 'em down and be like, dude, you gotta suck at naming things. You're

935
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:59,485
Speaker 5:  making this so unnecessarily complicated. I just,

936
00:54:59,565 --> 00:55:03,045
Speaker 5:  I hate the naming convention that they just seem to stick with.

937
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:06,565
Speaker 5:  But I played Gears of War Reloaded on the

938
00:55:07,245 --> 00:55:11,165
Speaker 5:  original Rogue Ally and then I went over to the Xbox R

939
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:13,605
Speaker 5:  Ally and the difference, like

940
00:55:15,165 --> 00:55:18,125
Speaker 5:  I, I put that thing in my hand and I'm like, I need this, I need this device

941
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:21,885
Speaker 5:  really, because the way that it's set up is it has like the,

942
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:25,885
Speaker 5:  the, the handholds like extend away from the console so it feels

943
00:55:25,915 --> 00:55:29,805
Speaker 5:  more like you're actually gripping a controller versus the Steam Deck

944
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:33,685
Speaker 5:  where it's just like this flat rectangular profile. And that little bit of

945
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:37,445
Speaker 5:  difference met so much because I could curl my hand more naturally.

946
00:55:37,825 --> 00:55:41,285
Speaker 5:  And I, I have just, like I said, I, I have this like claw hand situation

947
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:43,805
Speaker 5:  with the Steam Deck where after a couple of hours of play, like my hand cramps

948
00:55:43,805 --> 00:55:47,205
Speaker 5:  up And I, And I hate the way that it feels, but this, even though I'd only

949
00:55:47,205 --> 00:55:50,685
Speaker 5:  got to play with it a little bit, it felt so much better. And everybody that

950
00:55:50,685 --> 00:55:54,565
Speaker 5:  I was with in my little play testing pod said the same thing. Like, oh my

951
00:55:54,565 --> 00:55:58,205
Speaker 5:  God, this feels incredible. Same weight as like a Steam Deck.

952
00:55:58,515 --> 00:56:02,245
Speaker 5:  Like it performed really well. Like I, I went from the original

953
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:06,205
Speaker 5:  ally to the new Ally playing gears of war And I felt like my, my, I improved

954
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,005
Speaker 5:  a little bit with my shooting and whatever. Okay. Like I don't like first

955
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:12,405
Speaker 5:  person shooters, but I do like gears because I think that's more my speed

956
00:56:12,425 --> 00:56:15,125
Speaker 5:  in terms of, you know, shooting like those cover base shooting versus like

957
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:18,685
Speaker 5:  the twitchiness of like a Call of Duty. And I, I felt like I got better and

958
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:22,285
Speaker 5:  I'm like, oh this is, this is kind of sexy and like you, I've been waiting

959
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,445
Speaker 5:  for a, a game pass device essentially. Yeah. I

960
00:56:26,185 --> 00:56:30,125
Speaker 5:  am not smart. So I don't know how to mod my Steam Deck to do all that.

961
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:33,125
Speaker 5:  Like, you guys can do that. Go with the grace and favor of the Lord. That

962
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:37,045
Speaker 5:  is not for me. Give me a device that is all there So I don't have to

963
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:40,925
Speaker 5:  think about that. And if that is satisfied by this Xbox

964
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:45,365
Speaker 5:  R no ROG ally Xbox, no, I've still got it wrong for

965
00:56:45,605 --> 00:56:48,685
Speaker 5:  whatever, you know what I'm talking about. If that device can satisfy that

966
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:49,885
Speaker 5:  itch, it's day one for me.

967
00:56:50,505 --> 00:56:54,165
Speaker 2:  If I'm thinking about this right, it's basically like a, a normal sort of

968
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:57,645
Speaker 2:  handheld console that is like growing an Xbox controller, is that? Yes.

969
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:58,165
Speaker 2:  Okay.

970
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:02,485
Speaker 5:  Kind of. It's not, it doesn't like super protrude out, but it protrudes out

971
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:06,445
Speaker 5:  just enough that your hand can kind of close on it like a fist versus holding

972
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:09,365
Speaker 5:  it like this and that, that that little difference is a lot.

973
00:57:09,795 --> 00:57:13,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I like that. So, And I would assume the, from what I understand of

974
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:17,285
Speaker 2:  most of these consoles, the biggest thing people want from an Xbox

975
00:57:17,285 --> 00:57:21,205
Speaker 2:  version of this as opposed to just a normal handheld console is better

976
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:24,365
Speaker 2:  software, right? Like the, the thing everybody on our team keeps telling

977
00:57:24,365 --> 00:57:27,845
Speaker 2:  me is the problem with all of these handheld consoles is Windows yes. That

978
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:30,605
Speaker 2:  like you can build all the great hardware you want and Windows will just

979
00:57:30,605 --> 00:57:34,205
Speaker 2:  ruin it for you. All you need is a good home screen and then just play the

980
00:57:34,205 --> 00:57:36,525
Speaker 2:  games. And it is wild how hard that is with Windows

981
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:41,085
Speaker 5:  Take an Xbox, you know, like they had that big plastic cube

982
00:57:41,085 --> 00:57:44,885
Speaker 5:  thing that they molded and that reveal video just like take a

983
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:48,965
Speaker 5:  Xbox series s or X or whatever and put a screen on it and just

984
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:52,725
Speaker 5:  give that to me. Give me the Xbox interface, don't mess around

985
00:57:52,865 --> 00:57:56,725
Speaker 5:  and try to make it fancy with Windows. I know they have to do that because

986
00:57:56,795 --> 00:58:00,685
Speaker 5:  this is also gonna be a device that plays third party stores as well. So

987
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,525
Speaker 5:  there's gonna be some

988
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:06,085
Speaker 5:  shenanigans with the software that I'm gonna have to be able to navigate.

989
00:58:06,265 --> 00:58:10,165
Speaker 5:  But if you just, just, where is the Xbox in a handheld form? We have a

990
00:58:10,165 --> 00:58:14,125
Speaker 5:  PlayStation in a handheld form, we have a switch in a handheld form, we have

991
00:58:14,285 --> 00:58:18,245
Speaker 5:  a PC in a handheld form. Why is it so difficult for Xbox to make an Xbox

992
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,565
Speaker 5:  in a handheld form? Like I I, I really don't understand the disconnect there.

993
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:25,165
Speaker 2:  Do you think that's starting to change in a meaningful way? Like it's, it's

994
00:58:25,165 --> 00:58:27,725
Speaker 2:  clearly not an accident that they put this thing out there in front of people.

995
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:31,405
Speaker 2:  Is it, is, is 2025 the year of the handheld Xbox

996
00:58:31,405 --> 00:58:32,565
Speaker 2:  finally? Do you think?

997
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,885
Speaker 5:  We'll see it really depends on how

998
00:58:36,915 --> 00:58:40,805
Speaker 5:  well everything runs on that Xbox Ally. Like we

999
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:44,405
Speaker 5:  really have to see more of that interface, that ui. There's this

1000
00:58:44,575 --> 00:58:48,125
Speaker 5:  whole thing about whether or not a game is Xbox play anywhere or if it's

1001
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,765
Speaker 5:  something that you have to stream through the cloud because this is not a,

1002
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:54,805
Speaker 5:  you can't just boot up an Xbox Ally I believe and just play whatever

1003
00:58:54,955 --> 00:58:57,925
Speaker 5:  Xbox Games you have. You're, you're probably streaming them. They don't play

1004
00:58:57,925 --> 00:59:01,645
Speaker 5:  them natively. I mean, unless they have like a specific designation that's

1005
00:59:01,645 --> 00:59:05,445
Speaker 5:  a big problem. I think what consumers want, especially consumers like me

1006
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:09,045
Speaker 5:  who are kind of like on the low tech side where we don't, you know, do modding

1007
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,325
Speaker 5:  or anything like that. We just want the same experience we have at home in

1008
00:59:12,325 --> 00:59:15,485
Speaker 5:  our hands. And the other two can do that. Why can't Xbox?

1009
00:59:15,815 --> 00:59:18,685
Speaker 2:  Right. I do think you just made an incredibly compelling argument for the

1010
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:22,565
Speaker 2:  switch too. All of that is like, there are the, the, the

1011
00:59:22,585 --> 00:59:26,405
Speaker 2:  end of this road for the handheld Xbox I think is probably pretty great and,

1012
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:30,325
Speaker 2:  and Game Pass makes a lot of sense. Like you cans, you can see where it

1013
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:34,125
Speaker 2:  might go, but right now it's like, oh, would you like to look at a long checklist

1014
00:59:34,225 --> 00:59:37,045
Speaker 2:  to see if you can play your games or would you like to buy a switch to Exactly

1015
00:59:37,045 --> 00:59:40,765
Speaker 2:  correct. I it, that seems easy to me right now. Yeah,

1016
00:59:40,905 --> 00:59:43,645
Speaker 2:  it feels like there's some real catching up to do there for almost everybody

1017
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:44,525
Speaker 2:  else trying to play this game

1018
00:59:44,705 --> 00:59:48,045
Speaker 5:  For some reason Xbox likes to make things needlessly complicated. It it don't

1019
00:59:48,045 --> 00:59:51,445
Speaker 5:  gotta be that hard buddy, just put the console in my hand.

1020
00:59:51,915 --> 00:59:54,725
Speaker 5:  It's real. Make that happen and you'll it's real and you'll literally print

1021
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,685
Speaker 5:  money. Put it in my hand, print money

1022
00:59:57,195 --> 01:00:01,125
Speaker 2:  Xbox Series X with a screen, give it to me. This is it.

1023
01:00:01,505 --> 01:00:04,685
Speaker 2:  All right, well Ash, you are home. You have a mom to go teach about the switch.

1024
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,685
Speaker 2:  Keep us posted on how this goes. Do the welcome tour and let me know if it's

1025
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:12,285
Speaker 2:  worth the $10. I have not spent the $10 on principle, but like

1026
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:15,685
Speaker 2:  if it's worth it, I'll, I'll do it. So keep me posted. Okay,

1027
01:00:16,085 --> 01:00:17,205
Speaker 5:  I will definitely do that.

1028
01:00:17,465 --> 01:00:19,965
Speaker 2:  All right, thank you for being here. We gotta take a break. We're gonna come

1029
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:22,645
Speaker 2:  back with more switch stuff. We'll be right back.

1030
01:01:30,545 --> 01:01:33,685
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's do a question from The Vergecast hotline as

1031
01:01:33,685 --> 01:01:36,885
Speaker 2:  always, the number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. You can email vergecast at The

1032
01:01:36,965 --> 01:01:39,845
Speaker 2:  Verge dot com. We got a whole bunch of stuff coming up this summer to do

1033
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:43,605
Speaker 2:  so. Send us all of your questions for now. We're talking switch

1034
01:01:43,605 --> 01:01:45,125
Speaker 2:  today. We have a question about the switch.

1035
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:49,765
Speaker 6:  Hey there, Vergecast, this is Scott calling from Australia.

1036
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:54,205
Speaker 6:  My question's about the switch to mainly about

1037
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:57,605
Speaker 6:  considering the economics and the pricing because this is the first time

1038
01:01:58,295 --> 01:02:02,085
Speaker 6:  we've seen the most recent generation where it hasn't gone down in

1039
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,845
Speaker 6:  price. The switch kept the 2 99 price point. Other consoles are

1040
01:02:05,845 --> 01:02:09,685
Speaker 6:  staying the same or going up and now the switch to is also

1041
01:02:09,965 --> 01:02:13,805
Speaker 6:  a, a bump up from previous consoles. I'm just wondering

1042
01:02:14,195 --> 01:02:17,925
Speaker 6:  this is the first time it's ever happened and might this be the last

1043
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:22,205
Speaker 6:  generation of consoles that we see for some time until

1044
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:25,645
Speaker 6:  there's some kind of streamlining on the economics of making

1045
01:02:25,645 --> 01:02:28,445
Speaker 6:  manufacturing cheaper again or cost of living changes.

1046
01:02:29,535 --> 01:02:32,925
Speaker 6:  We've kind of peaked out on the, I think what the hardware does generally,

1047
01:02:32,985 --> 01:02:36,005
Speaker 6:  but I don't really know how much more we can do with

1048
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:40,645
Speaker 6:  hardware and pricing with upgrades if this pattern

1049
01:02:40,745 --> 01:02:44,525
Speaker 6:  of keeping the prices the same for seven years continues. So curious

1050
01:02:44,555 --> 01:02:45,405
Speaker 6:  what you think. Thanks.

1051
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:49,585
Speaker 2:  Alright. If ever there was a Sean Hollister coated VERGE cast hotline question,

1052
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:51,545
Speaker 2:  this is it. Sean Hollister, thanks for being here.

1053
01:02:51,885 --> 01:02:54,025
Speaker 7:  Hi, thanks for having me. Oh my goodness.

1054
01:02:54,545 --> 01:02:57,185
Speaker 2:  I feel like we have to talk about this in two pieces, right? There's the

1055
01:02:57,185 --> 01:03:00,265
Speaker 2:  like at least what do we do with the economics of consoles and then there's

1056
01:03:00,265 --> 01:03:03,505
Speaker 2:  the, is this the last console, which is like a mind bending thing that we

1057
01:03:03,505 --> 01:03:07,425
Speaker 2:  should talk about, but I'm just curious to how you're thinking

1058
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:10,025
Speaker 2:  about the price of all of this. We talked a little bit about it with Andrew

1059
01:03:10,025 --> 01:03:13,905
Speaker 2:  and Ash, but the, like I had not thought about until we heard this question

1060
01:03:13,975 --> 01:03:17,585
Speaker 2:  that the thing where the price of the console stayed

1061
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:21,225
Speaker 2:  consistent or even went up over time is

1062
01:03:21,295 --> 01:03:25,225
Speaker 2:  genuinely weird and unusual in the history of gaming. Yeah. What do you

1063
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:26,545
Speaker 2:  make of where we are at this moment?

1064
01:03:26,765 --> 01:03:30,505
Speaker 7:  Oh gosh, I feel like there are two camps here, two very, very vocal

1065
01:03:30,595 --> 01:03:34,145
Speaker 7:  camps. One of them is, hey, every time Apple

1066
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:37,905
Speaker 7:  introduces a new iPhone, the price of previous

1067
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:41,865
Speaker 7:  iPhones goes down in price, right? They're like, let's pass that savings

1068
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:45,865
Speaker 7:  along to you. They're like, yes, please give your old iPhones to other

1069
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:49,265
Speaker 7:  people who, who need them so that everybody could be on iPhone please,

1070
01:03:49,555 --> 01:03:52,985
Speaker 7:  folks who couldn't afford the latest and greatest now afford the last year's

1071
01:03:52,985 --> 01:03:56,305
Speaker 7:  model. Let's do it that way. And that way it seems like every year

1072
01:03:56,845 --> 01:04:00,625
Speaker 7:  you can get more for your money. And the other camp

1073
01:04:00,685 --> 01:04:04,365
Speaker 7:  is console prices and game prices have been

1074
01:04:04,385 --> 01:04:08,365
Speaker 7:  pretty stable for a very, very long time. They've gone up

1075
01:04:08,405 --> 01:04:11,165
Speaker 7:  a little bit here and a little bit there. I mean it was certainly a shock

1076
01:04:11,355 --> 01:04:15,125
Speaker 7:  when they announced the PlayStation three at 590, 90 US dollars, right? Giant

1077
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:19,005
Speaker 7:  enemy crab. That was this ridiculous moment for a lot of people.

1078
01:04:19,225 --> 01:04:22,085
Speaker 7:  How could it possibly cost so much? But they've actually been relatively

1079
01:04:22,265 --> 01:04:26,045
Speaker 7:  stable. The switch is a seven,

1080
01:04:26,255 --> 01:04:29,445
Speaker 7:  8-year-old console that's now being replaced with a new version.

1081
01:04:30,185 --> 01:04:33,885
Speaker 7:  And me personally, I think I'm more in the, in, in the first camp in the,

1082
01:04:34,305 --> 01:04:38,165
Speaker 7:  you should get more for your money seven years later because I would

1083
01:04:38,225 --> 01:04:42,125
Speaker 7:  expect that the switch would get this much better in that amount

1084
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:45,645
Speaker 7:  of time at the same price. But for those who have been

1085
01:04:45,785 --> 01:04:49,245
Speaker 7:  seeing how weird it is, these prices have stayed so stable.

1086
01:04:49,555 --> 01:04:53,165
Speaker 7:  This is an opportunity, a kind of a once in a many generation

1087
01:04:53,165 --> 01:04:57,005
Speaker 7:  opportunity for these companies to finally charge more money because they

1088
01:04:57,005 --> 01:05:00,965
Speaker 7:  have the tariffs going on, the the threat of

1089
01:05:00,985 --> 01:05:04,845
Speaker 7:  of of inflation everywhere. They can say, well, it costs us

1090
01:05:04,955 --> 01:05:08,605
Speaker 7:  more now we can finally afford to charge you a bit more too.

1091
01:05:09,345 --> 01:05:13,205
Speaker 7:  And I kind of wanna resist that, but I also see where the others are

1092
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:13,565
Speaker 7:  coming from.

1093
01:05:13,995 --> 01:05:17,865
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's tricky. It does seem like, on the one hand it is

1094
01:05:17,865 --> 01:05:21,345
Speaker 2:  certainly true that there are, you know, different economic headwinds facing

1095
01:05:21,345 --> 01:05:25,065
Speaker 2:  these companies. Like we weren't sure what the switch to was gonna cost

1096
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:27,705
Speaker 2:  for a while there. I don't think Nintendo knew what it was gonna cost for

1097
01:05:27,705 --> 01:05:31,505
Speaker 2:  a while there. And yet I think about the, the price of games

1098
01:05:31,505 --> 01:05:34,425
Speaker 2:  which has gone sort of inexorably upwards over the last several years. And

1099
01:05:34,425 --> 01:05:38,025
Speaker 2:  it really does feel like for good and evil

1100
01:05:38,045 --> 01:05:41,825
Speaker 2:  simultaneously, these companies are poking at the

1101
01:05:41,825 --> 01:05:45,265
Speaker 2:  edges of what people are willing to pay more than ever. And I think there

1102
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:48,985
Speaker 2:  is just this sense that games are expensive and they have

1103
01:05:49,335 --> 01:05:53,145
Speaker 2:  huge, huge audiences And I think a lot of these companies have figured

1104
01:05:53,145 --> 01:05:56,785
Speaker 2:  out they probably could make more money from them. And you could feel about

1105
01:05:56,785 --> 01:06:00,265
Speaker 2:  that however you want, but in a, in a, like in a shareholder

1106
01:06:00,265 --> 01:06:03,225
Speaker 2:  capitalism era, like of course they're gonna raise prices. So I think it's

1107
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,025
Speaker 2:  like, it, it's both a bummer and makes perfect sense to me. All at the same

1108
01:06:06,025 --> 01:06:06,265
Speaker 2:  time

1109
01:06:06,265 --> 01:06:09,785
Speaker 7:  In the Tendo 64 era games cost 60, 70, even

1110
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:13,025
Speaker 7:  $80 sometimes. Yeah. In Tendo 64 we're talking about like what,

1111
01:06:13,025 --> 01:06:16,945
Speaker 7:  95, 96 for Nintendo 64. And to find out that

1112
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:20,705
Speaker 7:  people are angry about that, it irks a lot of people inside game

1113
01:06:20,985 --> 01:06:24,265
Speaker 7:  companies where like our budgets have ballooned. Our, our, our players have,

1114
01:06:24,265 --> 01:06:27,185
Speaker 7:  you know, there's so many more players now we have to like, we have to build

1115
01:06:27,205 --> 01:06:29,865
Speaker 7:  all this extra content for them. The graphics level, there's so many more

1116
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:33,625
Speaker 7:  things you have to do for them, but it's really about

1117
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:37,505
Speaker 7:  what consumers will take. At the end of the day, it's about what are we willing

1118
01:06:37,605 --> 01:06:41,265
Speaker 7:  to pay? And many companies, you know, they've

1119
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:44,345
Speaker 7:  decided that in order to fund these bigger budgets, they're going to have

1120
01:06:44,345 --> 01:06:47,985
Speaker 7:  to fund big packs of DLC. They're gonna be like, we have to have all these

1121
01:06:47,985 --> 01:06:51,665
Speaker 7:  other things for you to purchase these DLC, these HD texture packs.

1122
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,265
Speaker 7:  It's now $10 for each of these switch two games to get the advancements there.

1123
01:06:55,295 --> 01:06:59,265
Speaker 7:  That might have been a free patch on a PC game like five years ago. Now they're

1124
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,745
Speaker 7:  like, okay, well we're gonna charge you a little bit more there too. And

1125
01:07:01,745 --> 01:07:04,905
Speaker 7:  the nickel and dimming effect of this co of companies charging you more for

1126
01:07:04,905 --> 01:07:08,505
Speaker 7:  all of these little things that grs on us too. But we

1127
01:07:08,665 --> 01:07:12,465
Speaker 7:  seem to be more willing to accept that, you know, death by a thousand

1128
01:07:12,535 --> 01:07:16,265
Speaker 7:  cuts than we are by all at once. Now games are $80 now games are

1129
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:16,745
Speaker 7:  $90.

1130
01:07:17,445 --> 01:07:21,305
Speaker 2:  It is true. It's, it's a good point. I had not, I I've probably spent

1131
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:24,445
Speaker 2:  more in like $5 increments,

1132
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:29,485
Speaker 2:  like by a vast margin than I have just on more expensive consoles, right?

1133
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:33,005
Speaker 2:  Like the, the the way that they bleed you is, is the micro transactions.

1134
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:36,085
Speaker 2:  That's where the real money is selling you the console the first time

1135
01:07:37,565 --> 01:07:40,785
Speaker 2:  is not how these companies are going to make most of their money going forward.

1136
01:07:40,805 --> 01:07:44,385
Speaker 2:  And that that's probably bad. Like you could, you could maybe argue

1137
01:07:44,695 --> 01:07:47,785
Speaker 2:  that each of these things should be a thousand dollars and then there shouldn't

1138
01:07:47,785 --> 01:07:51,425
Speaker 2:  be any micro transactions inside of games and that might be a better world

1139
01:07:51,425 --> 01:07:55,305
Speaker 2:  to live in. But that is in no way the world we live in and is not where

1140
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:55,625
Speaker 2:  we're headed.

1141
01:07:55,885 --> 01:07:59,545
Speaker 7:  It isn't. The price of the switch to is really complicated that when you

1142
01:07:59,545 --> 01:08:03,465
Speaker 7:  get into this idea that like, is this, is this like the end of consoles as

1143
01:08:03,465 --> 01:08:06,465
Speaker 7:  we know them now that we're seeing like the prices go up so dramatically.

1144
01:08:06,785 --> 01:08:09,745
Speaker 7:  I wanna push back on that a little bit before we get to the second part about,

1145
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:13,385
Speaker 7:  is this the end of consoles? So the switch to price

1146
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:17,085
Speaker 7:  is, is very intriguing because in the

1147
01:08:17,105 --> 01:08:20,925
Speaker 7:  United States it's coming at a time when we

1148
01:08:20,985 --> 01:08:24,565
Speaker 7:  can see the existing switches stay on shelves at lower prices.

1149
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:29,125
Speaker 7:  And we can see that the PlayStation five is like a pretty good deal

1150
01:08:29,565 --> 01:08:33,525
Speaker 7:  compared to a switch two. And that is just not the case over

1151
01:08:33,545 --> 01:08:37,245
Speaker 7:  in Japan. Over in Japan where they are also having to sell a lot of these

1152
01:08:37,245 --> 01:08:40,845
Speaker 7:  switch toss over there. The PlayStations are all

1153
01:08:41,045 --> 01:08:44,605
Speaker 7:  ridiculously more expensive. Sony has raised the prices of PlayStations

1154
01:08:44,775 --> 01:08:48,605
Speaker 7:  three times over there. Oh wow. And they've raised them almost the rest of

1155
01:08:48,605 --> 01:08:51,205
Speaker 7:  the world except for the United States. The United States is like the one

1156
01:08:51,235 --> 01:08:55,205
Speaker 7:  outlier where Sony's like, we'll keep the prices fine over

1157
01:08:55,205 --> 01:08:58,765
Speaker 7:  there because we really, really care about that audience over in Japan.

1158
01:08:59,355 --> 01:09:03,285
Speaker 7:  There's this almost a sense of gratitude towards Nintendo for this price

1159
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:07,085
Speaker 7:  that's only like a certain amount more than the original switch because it's

1160
01:09:07,085 --> 01:09:10,445
Speaker 7:  not anywhere near as bad as what you'd have to play for a PlayStation over

1161
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:14,285
Speaker 7:  there. And because of the way the exchange rate is

1162
01:09:14,285 --> 01:09:18,085
Speaker 7:  working right now, if Nintendo brought out the switch

1163
01:09:18,105 --> 01:09:21,965
Speaker 7:  to in Japan at kind of like the price that

1164
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:26,615
Speaker 7:  we would be seeing over here for inflation, people would

1165
01:09:26,645 --> 01:09:30,215
Speaker 7:  descend on Japan and buy all those and bring them to other places and do

1166
01:09:30,215 --> 01:09:33,815
Speaker 7:  all kinds of weird arbitrage because you can just get so much more

1167
01:09:34,515 --> 01:09:37,335
Speaker 7:  in Japan for your dollar right now because of the exchange rate.

1168
01:09:37,795 --> 01:09:41,215
Speaker 2:  That's really interesting. So what, what do you make of this? Is this the

1169
01:09:41,215 --> 01:09:45,015
Speaker 2:  last console thing? Because I think there is a, there is a version of

1170
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:48,735
Speaker 2:  the story here that says these things are going to get more expensive but

1171
01:09:48,735 --> 01:09:52,175
Speaker 2:  you're going to buy them much less often, right? Like already

1172
01:09:52,675 --> 01:09:56,255
Speaker 2:  the the console generations are, are pretty far apart. And

1173
01:09:56,555 --> 01:09:59,455
Speaker 2:  if we're gonna get to the point where most of the money is in games and most

1174
01:09:59,455 --> 01:10:02,935
Speaker 2:  of the money is in live service stuff, maybe we hit the point where

1175
01:10:03,755 --> 01:10:07,535
Speaker 2:  either the console becomes something you replace the way you replace like

1176
01:10:07,655 --> 01:10:11,295
Speaker 2:  a car or it becomes sort of irrelevant altogether and this just

1177
01:10:11,305 --> 01:10:15,135
Speaker 2:  stops being like a, a piece of really expensive hardware that you buy.

1178
01:10:15,155 --> 01:10:19,055
Speaker 2:  But I think our caller here is basing this on the theory that

1179
01:10:19,055 --> 01:10:21,975
Speaker 2:  maybe we're maxing out the technology available for video games.

1180
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:26,375
Speaker 2:  I'm just gonna go on a limb and guess that you do not think that is true.

1181
01:10:27,015 --> 01:10:30,335
Speaker 7:  I I I definitely don't, but it really depends on the company.

1182
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:34,815
Speaker 7:  Microsoft seems to have already decided that that

1183
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:38,655
Speaker 7:  was the last full Xbox where, you know, the, the Xbox series

1184
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:42,495
Speaker 7:  X and SI mean they've already decided that that is the last time

1185
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:46,775
Speaker 7:  they put out a box and the box is the only thing they've

1186
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:50,215
Speaker 7:  decided very, very clearly that Xbox

1187
01:10:50,965 --> 01:10:54,815
Speaker 7:  that that you're, that you're streaming is a big chunk of that, that you're

1188
01:10:54,815 --> 01:10:57,495
Speaker 7:  going to pay for a subscription service to stream your games. That you're

1189
01:10:57,495 --> 01:11:00,655
Speaker 7:  gonna be able to play them on Windows systems that look and feel like Xbox

1190
01:11:01,285 --> 01:11:04,695
Speaker 7:  that you're going to, that they're, they're going to merge these things into

1191
01:11:04,715 --> 01:11:07,575
Speaker 7:  what's going to be one seamless al Does that mean they stop selling a box?

1192
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:10,735
Speaker 7:  I don't think so, right? But they've already decided that it's going to be

1193
01:11:10,735 --> 01:11:14,685
Speaker 7:  just one part of their strategy. Over on the PlayStation side of

1194
01:11:14,685 --> 01:11:17,725
Speaker 7:  things, what we think is happening, what the rumors seem to be pointing to

1195
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:21,765
Speaker 7:  is it becomes a continuum where the next

1196
01:11:22,465 --> 01:11:26,325
Speaker 7:  big PlayStation entry is not like a PlayStation six that

1197
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:30,045
Speaker 7:  replaces the PlayStation five as a one-to-one. Maybe it's going to be a PlayStation

1198
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:33,845
Speaker 7:  handheld. Hmm. Maybe it's going to be, you know, we, we've got a PlayStation

1199
01:11:33,845 --> 01:11:37,125
Speaker 7:  portal streaming device there. But the idea being there that

1200
01:11:37,755 --> 01:11:41,525
Speaker 7:  we'd already seen with the PlayStation four, the

1201
01:11:41,525 --> 01:11:44,885
Speaker 7:  PlayStation four pro, the PlayStation five, the PlayStation five pro

1202
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:49,165
Speaker 7:  that we've reached a a, a kind of a PC graphics card

1203
01:11:49,975 --> 01:11:53,885
Speaker 7:  level of purchasing where you pay for the amount

1204
01:11:53,885 --> 01:11:57,685
Speaker 7:  of power you want to have and you play all

1205
01:11:57,705 --> 01:12:01,605
Speaker 7:  the same games on it with different levels of power. So if you get the PS

1206
01:12:01,605 --> 01:12:05,165
Speaker 7:  five pro, those games are gonna look the best and if you get the PS five,

1207
01:12:05,165 --> 01:12:07,965
Speaker 7:  they're gonna look a little bit worse. And if you get the PS four pro a little

1208
01:12:07,965 --> 01:12:11,925
Speaker 7:  bit worse, but they all basically play the same exact games, many of

1209
01:12:11,925 --> 01:12:15,805
Speaker 7:  which you could play on PC with different levels of graphic power too. The

1210
01:12:15,805 --> 01:12:19,605
Speaker 7:  next entry there might be the PlayStation five handheld

1211
01:12:19,605 --> 01:12:23,525
Speaker 7:  or the PlayStation 5.5 or whatever you wanna call this in between

1212
01:12:23,795 --> 01:12:27,645
Speaker 7:  step where instead of them going to a full PlayStation six, they shrink

1213
01:12:27,645 --> 01:12:31,525
Speaker 7:  down the amount of performance that you have to maybe, maybe

1214
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:35,205
Speaker 7:  it's a PS four pro level of performance or maybe it's PS like a a

1215
01:12:35,305 --> 01:12:38,685
Speaker 7:  PS five light level of performance, but you can now take it with you, like

1216
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:42,485
Speaker 7:  you take a switch with you and you got a couple hours apply on those same

1217
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:45,365
Speaker 7:  PS five games. I think that's the direction that's going.

1218
01:12:45,635 --> 01:12:49,525
Speaker 2:  What that does suggest then is that maybe we're headed to a

1219
01:12:49,525 --> 01:12:52,525
Speaker 2:  point where we're used to these consoles being

1220
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:57,045
Speaker 2:  kind of step function improvements performance wise, right? Like the PS four

1221
01:12:57,225 --> 01:13:00,205
Speaker 2:  to the PS five And I guess especially the PS three to the PS four was like

1222
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:03,965
Speaker 2:  a huge like super computer leap in,

1223
01:13:04,265 --> 01:13:08,165
Speaker 2:  in performance. And what I was gonna ask you coming

1224
01:13:08,225 --> 01:13:11,965
Speaker 2:  in was like, okay, we've had this big run of graphic cards from Nvidia and,

1225
01:13:11,965 --> 01:13:15,725
Speaker 2:  and we're in this like sort of newly invigorated space

1226
01:13:15,785 --> 01:13:19,605
Speaker 2:  of PC gaming in a lot of ways, but it also sort of seems like that

1227
01:13:19,665 --> 01:13:23,405
Speaker 2:  is is hitting a plateau in some ways where like

1228
01:13:23,985 --> 01:13:27,725
Speaker 2:  the, the games are only so good and the, the chips are only so good and they,

1229
01:13:27,725 --> 01:13:31,125
Speaker 2:  they kind of run at different speeds. But maybe what it sounds like is actually

1230
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:33,845
Speaker 2:  what's gonna happen is there's going to continue to be the sort of top of

1231
01:13:33,845 --> 01:13:37,365
Speaker 2:  the line thing, but because it's not the only thing

1232
01:13:37,365 --> 01:13:40,445
Speaker 2:  anymore because you don't have to just buy the fancy one because there are

1233
01:13:40,445 --> 01:13:44,325
Speaker 2:  other ones available now that maybe what happens is the top

1234
01:13:44,325 --> 01:13:48,265
Speaker 2:  of the line thing doesn't improve as fast. Does that make

1235
01:13:48,265 --> 01:13:51,305
Speaker 2:  sense? Like if you have this whole spectrum, you don't have to make the next

1236
01:13:51,305 --> 01:13:55,065
Speaker 2:  thing the best thing because it's just gonna be the the one for the people

1237
01:13:55,065 --> 01:13:56,145
Speaker 2:  who want the most fancy thing.

1238
01:13:56,625 --> 01:14:00,305
Speaker 7:  I think that's very much right. I don't know if it's because it has

1239
01:14:00,425 --> 01:14:04,345
Speaker 7:  to be that way or because the companies want it to be that way if it has

1240
01:14:04,345 --> 01:14:07,185
Speaker 7:  to be that way now in this moment, in this

1241
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,705
Speaker 7:  geo-economic climb with tariffs and

1242
01:14:11,305 --> 01:14:14,325
Speaker 7:  supply chain issues and all kinds of things that were previously figured

1243
01:14:14,385 --> 01:14:18,045
Speaker 7:  out all of a sudden not being figured out or, or if it has to be this way

1244
01:14:18,045 --> 01:14:21,925
Speaker 7:  because Nvidia and a MD see all the profit in generative ai. Yeah.

1245
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:25,165
Speaker 7:  And they wanna put all of the manufacturing resources toward that and very

1246
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:29,125
Speaker 7:  little towards gaming. If it has to be that way right now and it

1247
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:33,165
Speaker 7:  could change back to the step function later. I think there are a

1248
01:14:33,165 --> 01:14:37,085
Speaker 7:  lot of people both inside the companies and us gamers who would

1249
01:14:37,085 --> 01:14:40,605
Speaker 7:  like it to go back to step change. But there are a lot of benefits to the

1250
01:14:40,605 --> 01:14:44,405
Speaker 7:  incremental cycle. I mean, in the world of PCs, there are new graphics cards

1251
01:14:44,415 --> 01:14:48,205
Speaker 7:  every two to three years. People don't buy new graphics cards every

1252
01:14:48,285 --> 01:14:52,005
Speaker 7:  two to three years. Right? Though not unless they are the diehards. You can

1253
01:14:52,035 --> 01:14:55,965
Speaker 7:  wait 5, 7, 8, 10 years before you buy your

1254
01:14:55,965 --> 01:14:59,925
Speaker 7:  next graphics card and all of a sudden all of your games look amazingly better

1255
01:14:59,925 --> 01:15:02,565
Speaker 7:  and they run it smoother Frame rates the same games that you had a decade

1256
01:15:02,705 --> 01:15:06,525
Speaker 7:  ago. We're starting to see the benefits of that in handhelds as

1257
01:15:06,725 --> 01:15:10,705
Speaker 7:  well with the Steam Deck and some of these Windows platforms where some people,

1258
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:14,385
Speaker 7:  it's been so long since they've been in PC gaming

1259
01:15:15,055 --> 01:15:18,425
Speaker 7:  that those same games they played a long time ago look better on this

1260
01:15:18,545 --> 01:15:22,385
Speaker 7:  handheld than they did on their last desktop pc.

1261
01:15:22,385 --> 01:15:26,185
Speaker 7:  That's how long some people wait now because that is possible in pc

1262
01:15:26,845 --> 01:15:30,745
Speaker 7:  And I would love for that to be possible in console

1263
01:15:31,005 --> 01:15:34,945
Speaker 7:  two for a very long time. It was impossible because of

1264
01:15:34,945 --> 01:15:38,825
Speaker 7:  backwards compatibility concerns. I mean, if you tried to develop a

1265
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:42,345
Speaker 7:  game for the PlayStation three's cell processor, which was

1266
01:15:42,595 --> 01:15:46,465
Speaker 7:  infamously difficult to develop for and required, you know, this

1267
01:15:46,465 --> 01:15:50,425
Speaker 7:  very specialized hardware and then you go to the PlayStation four and

1268
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:52,785
Speaker 7:  you, you're like, okay, well I'm gonna play all my PS three games on that,

1269
01:15:52,785 --> 01:15:56,625
Speaker 7:  right? It was like, no, you, you would need so much brute force horsepower

1270
01:15:56,645 --> 01:16:00,585
Speaker 7:  to do that, sell stuff on this new X 86 chip that's more

1271
01:16:00,585 --> 01:16:04,505
Speaker 7:  like a, a Windows machine. But now that all the consoles

1272
01:16:04,645 --> 01:16:08,345
Speaker 7:  and all the handhelds are using the

1273
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:12,105
Speaker 7:  same underlying chip architecture, they're basically all

1274
01:16:12,105 --> 01:16:15,945
Speaker 7:  playing PC games more or less. You could kind

1275
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:18,945
Speaker 7:  of have a world where you just say, I'm willing to spend this much money

1276
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:23,145
Speaker 7:  for this much horsepower and my stuff will play on it.

1277
01:16:24,015 --> 01:16:27,865
Speaker 2:  Okay. Which, which actually seems like on sort of both parts

1278
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:30,625
Speaker 2:  of the question here, a good outcome, right? You, you end up in a position

1279
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:33,985
Speaker 2:  where I, I'm not forced to buy the thing that is getting relentlessly more

1280
01:16:33,985 --> 01:16:37,865
Speaker 2:  expensive because I don't, I don't need the most powerful highest end

1281
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:41,625
Speaker 2:  thing I'm able to sort of scale down to fit both my budgets and my needs.

1282
01:16:42,085 --> 01:16:45,905
Speaker 2:  But also it means you can get lots of different variations of

1283
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:49,705
Speaker 2:  the thing rather than just being like, here is the new Xbox, take it or lead

1284
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:49,825
Speaker 2:  it.

1285
01:16:49,885 --> 01:16:52,705
Speaker 7:  You absolutely can. And that's what we're seeing with Nintendo. Nintendo

1286
01:16:52,705 --> 01:16:56,305
Speaker 7:  says, here's the switch too, by the way. We are also still selling

1287
01:16:56,555 --> 01:16:59,785
Speaker 7:  three other models of Switch. You don't wanna pay, you know,

1288
01:17:00,095 --> 01:17:03,945
Speaker 7:  450 for a switch too. We've got our switch ole, we've got our switch and

1289
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:07,105
Speaker 7:  we've got our switch light and they're all there ready for you to play

1290
01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:10,930
Speaker 7:  relatively the same game. Now we don't know if Nintendo's gonna turn around

1291
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:14,885
Speaker 7:  and be like, actually 90% of our switch two library, all of these

1292
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:18,685
Speaker 7:  new games we're developing will only be playable on switch two. Right? And

1293
01:17:18,685 --> 01:17:22,165
Speaker 7:  they make a big break there and, and then people who are, you know,

1294
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:26,405
Speaker 7:  kind of forced to upgrade from Switch on the Xbox

1295
01:17:26,515 --> 01:17:30,485
Speaker 7:  side of things, you don't have to worry about that. Probably on the future

1296
01:17:30,515 --> 01:17:33,445
Speaker 7:  PlayStation side of things, you don't have to worry about that as much because

1297
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:37,045
Speaker 7:  there will be streaming to fill in some of the gaps. But

1298
01:17:37,435 --> 01:17:41,245
Speaker 7:  none of these are anywhere near as open as PC

1299
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:44,965
Speaker 7:  where I'm like, okay, games I have 10, 20, 30 years ago

1300
01:17:45,015 --> 01:17:48,885
Speaker 7:  still play on a modern PC and often weigh

1301
01:17:48,885 --> 01:17:52,365
Speaker 7:  the heck better because of everything that's happened in between with

1302
01:17:52,365 --> 01:17:54,845
Speaker 7:  horsepower and monitors getting better and so on.

1303
01:17:55,715 --> 01:17:58,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, fair enough. All right, well this actually made me feel better. This

1304
01:17:58,365 --> 01:18:01,045
Speaker 2:  was, this was very exciting. Thank you for doing this Scott. I hope this

1310
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:18,845
Speaker 2:  thoughts about the battery life. We've been hearing really mixed things about

1311
01:18:18,845 --> 01:18:22,325
Speaker 2:  battery life, anything on your mind about the switch to or really anything

1312

Speaker 2:  her experiences and the games, all this stuff. There's a huge run of

1318
01:18:44,285 --> 01:18:47,325
Speaker 2:  games coming this summer for the Switch two And I think it might change how

1319
01:18:47,365 --> 01:18:50,885
Speaker 2:  a lot of people feel about the console for better or for worse. So

1320

Speaker 2:  keep it locked and tell us everything that you're experiencing about the

1321

1325
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:11,845

1326
01:19:11,865 --> 01:19:15,845
Speaker 2:  say that at some point here in the near future, one or both of Neli

1327

Speaker 2:  And I are just going to sort of mysteriously disappear to go have kids.

1328
01:19:19,735 --> 01:19:23,205
Speaker 2:  These things happen without a lot of notice sometimes, so

1329
01:19:24,615 --> 01:19:27,805
Speaker 2:  we'll, we'll try and, you know, make the transition as seamless as possible,
