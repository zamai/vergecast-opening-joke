00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,300
Speaker 3:  Hollywood writers and actors are still striking and one of the things

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,020
Speaker 3:  they're fighting against is AI swooping in and taking their

4
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,000
Speaker 3:  jobs. But truth is AI is already

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
Speaker 3:  all over Hollywood.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,120
Speaker 4:  You know, Harrison Ford has come out and said that

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,930
Speaker 4:  he not only is okay with the de aging process

8
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,820
Speaker 4:  that was used in the most recent Indiana Jones, but he thought it was skillfully

9
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,400
Speaker 4:  done.

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,080
Speaker 3:  The fight over AI in TV and film. This week

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,260
Speaker 3:  on Intuit Vultures Pop culture

12
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:15,050
Speaker 3:  podcast,

13
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,920

Speaker 5:  I'm your friend David Pierce and in lieu of our normal Wednesday episode

15
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,940
Speaker 5:  this week, I wanna play you an episode of Land of the Giants. It's

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,100
Speaker 5:  another podcast on the Vox Media podcast network. It's one of our favorite

17
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,980
Speaker 5:  shows and if you like The Vergecast, I'm pretty confident you

18
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,620
Speaker 5:  will love Land of the Giants. We've done series on Facebook, we've done

19
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,520
Speaker 5:  series on dating apps, we've done series on Netflix, and the current one

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,290
Speaker 5:  is all about Tesla. And this episode, the one I wanna play you is the second

21
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,380
Speaker 5:  episode in the new season. You can go subscribe to Land of the Giants and

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,040
Speaker 5:  listen to the first episode, but you actually don't need to have heard it

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,930
Speaker 5:  for this episode to work. This episode is really all about

24
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,920
Speaker 5:  Elon Musk as a leader, what he learned from being booted out of PayPal,

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,750
Speaker 5:  how he took over Tesla from its founders and how he turned

26
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,650
Speaker 5:  Tesla the company and Elon Musk the c e o

27
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,480
Speaker 5:  into very much the same thing. The big open question in this episode

28
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,260
Speaker 5:  is so fascinating to me, basically, is Elon Musk

29
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,980
Speaker 5:  a megalomaniac above all else? Who would do anything to be

30
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,860
Speaker 5:  more famous and more powerful? Or did he believe in the

31
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,540
Speaker 5:  mission of Tesla and wanna save the planet above all else and do what

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,860
Speaker 5:  was required to get there? It's hard to know for sure. I'm not sure we'll

33
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,780
Speaker 5:  ever know for sure, but I really think it matters given how much

34
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,740
Speaker 5:  this guy is at the center of business and culture right now. There's

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,450
Speaker 5:  also this underlying story here about what you might call the

36
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,440
Speaker 5:  Elon Musk cinematic universe and how the stories of PayPal

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,840
Speaker 5:  and SpaceX and Tesla and Twitter all actually

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,580
Speaker 5:  inform one another. You could make a really compelling case that

39
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,540
Speaker 5:  Tesla wouldn't have become Tesla if Twitter didn't exist, for

40
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,360
Speaker 5:  instance, and that if Musk had never run Tesla, he might never

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Speaker 5:  have bought Twitter. It's fascinating. Anyway, this episode is great. This

42
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,520
Speaker 5:  series has been great. There are a bunch of Verge voices here. You're gonna

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,400
Speaker 5:  hear Liz Lipato and Andy Hawkins. Even my cohost Neli Patel has

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,360
Speaker 5:  been in the series. It's great. I can't recommend it highly enough. I really

45
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,940
Speaker 5:  think you'll love this episode and this whole series of land of the Giants.

50
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,010
Speaker 5:  fun new stuff. In the meantime, here's Land of the Giants.

51
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,500
Speaker 3:  The year 2000 was a crazy good year for Elon

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,230
Speaker 3:  Musk. He was the c e o of an exciting new startup, a company

53
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,050
Speaker 3:  that promised to disrupt a fundamental part of daily life, how you

54
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,510
Speaker 3:  pay for things with

55
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,390
Speaker 6:  PayPal, you can pay for anything, anytime, anywhere.

56
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,860
Speaker 3:  A brand new company that was the result of a merger between Musk's online

57
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,340
Speaker 3:  bank and a payments company co-founded by a guy named Peter

58
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,830
Speaker 3:  Teel. Musk and Teal looked like a dream team on

59
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,780
Speaker 3:  paper, two Silicon Valley rising stars with one vision

60
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,710
Speaker 3:  blow up the banking world. Musk even felt confident enough as c e

61
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,220
Speaker 3:  o to take a quick break.

62
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,390
Speaker 7:  I've gotten married earlier that year and not had any vacation or honeymoon

63
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,720
Speaker 7:  or anything.

64
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,550
Speaker 3:  Turns out he was a little too confident 'cause Musk's honeymoon

65
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,030
Speaker 3:  period at PayPal was already over.

66
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,880
Speaker 7:  I think it's not a good idea to leave the office when

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,670
Speaker 7:  there are like a lot of major things underway, which are causing

68
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,700
Speaker 7:  people a great deal of stress.

69
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,610
Speaker 8:  Elon went on his honeymoon and they did a coup and forced him

70
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,210
Speaker 8:  out.

71
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,070
Speaker 3:  Liz Lipato has covered Musk for years at The. Verge. Musk may have

72
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,590
Speaker 3:  been the c e O of PayPal, but Teal had installed guys from his former

73
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,470
Speaker 3:  company in most of the other C-Suite slots. The moment Musk was

74
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,430
Speaker 3:  outta sight, they persuaded PayPal's board to oust him and

75
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,080
Speaker 3:  replace him with none other than Peter Thiel.

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,990
Speaker 7:  There was just a lot of worry and that caused the management

77
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,540
Speaker 7:  team to decide that I wasn't the right guy to run the company.

78
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,710
Speaker 3:  Another way to look at this coup is that Musk was never really in control

79
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,670
Speaker 3:  of PayPal. Even with that c e o title, teal was the

80
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,140
Speaker 3:  one who held all the cards. Lesson learned

81
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,020
Speaker 8:  Elon Musk is very much about Elon Musk and there's like a real

82
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,530
Speaker 8:  need for control that shows up in

83
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,430
Speaker 8:  his companies where he needs to be in charge all of the time. Having

84
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,350
Speaker 8:  learned from PayPal that if he didn't create that situation, he

85
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,330
Speaker 8:  could potentially be fired.

86
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,010
Speaker 3:  But after PayPal, Musk had no company to control licking his

87
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,170
Speaker 3:  wounds, he started looking around for something different.

88
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,030
Speaker 7:  On a personal level, At this point, I would say I'm a little tired of the

89
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,870
Speaker 7:  internet. The next company that I do, one of the things that I think would

90
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,250
Speaker 7:  be important is that it has some long-term beneficial

91
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,750
Speaker 7:  effect.

92
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,170
Speaker 3:  A few years later, a couple of guys who were also excited about changing

93
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,140
Speaker 3:  the world came to to him with an idea and it was just what he was looking

94
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,800
Speaker 3:  for. A

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,540
Speaker 3:  fast, sporty electric car, Musk went all

96
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,670
Speaker 3:  in.

97
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,240
Speaker 3:  This is Land of the Giants. I'm Patrick George, your co-host this

98
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,560
Speaker 3:  season. I'm an automotive journalist. I've covered the industry for about

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
Speaker 3:  a decade, including as the editor-in-chief of Jalopnik and editorial director

100
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,600
Speaker 3:  of the Drive. And the whole time I've been covering cars, I can tell you

101
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,840
Speaker 3:  that nothing is quite defined. The modern car industry like the rise of

102
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,560
Speaker 3:  Tesla, but not many people remember, it

103
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,440
Speaker 3:  wasn't Musk's idea to start with today, the story of how Elon Musk

104
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,320
Speaker 3:  made Tesla his own and the perils of shaping a company in one zone

105
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,180
Speaker 3:  image

106
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,520
Speaker 3:  before Musk even arrived, there were two guys with a dream. In

107
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Speaker 3:  2000, Martin Eberhardt had just sold his first startup developing

108
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,200
Speaker 3:  an early e-reader technology. He needed a new ride and he wanted to treat

109
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,320
Speaker 3:  himself a bit.

110
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,700
Speaker 9:  I was considering getting myself a new car and something fun and sporty.

111
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,430
Speaker 3:  He loved to drive fast cars, but a Porsche nine 11, a Ferrari

112
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,420
Speaker 3:  problem was those cars were terrible on gas.

113
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,320
Speaker 9:  To me, by 2001, climate change looked real. I, it

114
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,660
Speaker 9:  looked like it was a real deal.

115
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,000
Speaker 3:  So he looked around for something a little less like a carbon bomb, but the

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,460
Speaker 3:  options at the time were kind of sad.

117
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,420
Speaker 10:  Martin called these cars punishment cars designed by people

118
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,760
Speaker 10:  who really didn't believe you should be driving. This

119
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,500
Speaker 3:  Is Mark Tarting eberhardt's friend and business partner since the eighties.

120
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,060
Speaker 10:  You know, you should be riding your bike or taking public transit or walking,

121
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,760
Speaker 10:  but if you had to drive, you needed to be put into one of these things to

122
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,310
Speaker 10:  be punished.

123
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,600
Speaker 9:  That got mark's and my heads thinking

124
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,960
Speaker 9:  about that this was a a real opportunity. What

125
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,880
Speaker 3:  If there was an electric car that was fast, sleek and sexy for

126
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,430
Speaker 3:  people like Everhart rich dudes who like flashy toys?

127
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,820
Speaker 10:  When you look at the market there, turns out there's a segment that

128
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,400
Speaker 10:  is super into that and that's a sports car segment and the

129
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,320
Speaker 10:  faster you can get to, you know, zero to 60 miles per hour, the more

130
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,520
Speaker 10:  people are willing to pay. And if you can really get it close, people are

131
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,340
Speaker 10:  willing to pay almost an insane amount of money for it.

132
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,300
Speaker 3:  The guys wanted that kind of car and the money didn't sound bad either,

133
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,920
Speaker 3:  so they decided to do something audacious, start their own car

134
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,880
Speaker 3:  company. The first thing they needed to do was figure out how to power the

135
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,790
Speaker 3:  car. At the time, lithium ion batteries were mostly used for small things

136
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,720
Speaker 3:  like e-readers and laptops, but the guys knew these batteries could do

137
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,320
Speaker 3:  a lot more like power a car for a much greater distance on a single

138
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,160
Speaker 3:  charge than anyone had ever seen before. But just to make sure they

139
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,020
Speaker 3:  mocked up a sample battery and tested it out in a car and

140
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,960
Speaker 3:  it worked. But these were tech guys, they didn't know where to begin

141
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,240
Speaker 3:  with building the rest of the car. So they partnered with a small British

142
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Speaker 3:  automaker named Lotus, A Lotus Body would house all the

143
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,880
Speaker 3:  cool EV tech these guys could come up with. The last

144
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,840
Speaker 3:  thing they needed was a name.

145
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,700
Speaker 9:  I had been out on a date with a woman who became my wife,

146
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,280
Speaker 9:  And I had been in the back of my head thinking about this company and thinking

147
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,820
Speaker 9:  about names and the idea of Tesla came to me. And I proposed that to her

148
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,950
Speaker 9:  and she loved it.

149
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,280
Speaker 3:  Okay, so they actually needed one more thing money. There

150
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,320
Speaker 9:  Were so many reasons not to invest in Tesla that there, we didn't exactly

151
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,280
Speaker 9:  have investors coming outta the woodwork wanting to invest in

152
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,350
Speaker 9:  us

153
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,870
Speaker 3:  For months. The payer were in and out of dozens of venture capital firms.

154
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,850
Speaker 10:  It was a pretty radical idea, you know, a new car

155
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,080
Speaker 10:  company,

156
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,850
Speaker 3:  Wall Street and VCs loathed the car industry. Cars were

157
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,830
Speaker 3:  expensive. Capital intensive products that required complicated supply chains

158
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,430
Speaker 3:  and enormous amounts of manual labor. Newcomers never succeeded.

159
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,370
Speaker 3:  And remember nobody was taking EVs seriously back then, but there

160
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,210
Speaker 3:  was one person with a lot of extra cash who was not easily daunted.

161
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,540
Speaker 10:  We got an intro to, to Elon.

162
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,830
Speaker 3:  Musk was into risk. I mean his other company was trying to

163
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,330
Speaker 3:  colonize Mars.

164
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,230
Speaker 9:  My initial presser of of him was he was quite smart and and quite

165
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,980
Speaker 9:  enthusiastic. He

166
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,350
Speaker 10:  Immediately got it. He was like, oh, I see he did all the math. I love

167
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,030
Speaker 10:  that, you know, I'm in and

168
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,050
Speaker 9:  I mean you wouldn't guess it by the things he said today. But at the time

169
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,110
Speaker 9:  it seemed really clear that he understood that that climate change was a

170
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,260
Speaker 9:  real problem.

171
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,410
Speaker 3:  When Musk made his first investment in Everhart and Targeting's company,

172
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,990
Speaker 3:  he was almost four years out from the sting of being ousted from PayPal and

173
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,570
Speaker 3:  on his way to establishing a reputation as a kind of tech maverick.

174
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,550
Speaker 8:  He had a very restless mind. And I think he found he had

175
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,880
Speaker 8:  a very big interest with the world

176
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,740
Speaker 8:  dying.

177
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,150
Speaker 3:  This is tech journalist Kara Swisher, who's been following Elon Musk since

178
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,050
Speaker 3:  the nineties.

179
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,270
Speaker 8:  That's why he was interested in space travel to get off this planet. He always

180
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,210
Speaker 8:  thought there should be a multi-planetary species. He was worried about the

181
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,110
Speaker 8:  end times, so that's why he focused on things like Tesla, which he

182
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,450
Speaker 8:  thought was existential to the human race

183
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,350
Speaker 3:  To Swisher. Musk was nothing like his peers. Everyone around him was building

184
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,190
Speaker 3:  online stores or primitive social networks and Musk was trying to save

185
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,070
Speaker 3:  the world. He

186
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,870
Speaker 8:  Could have made a lot more money, a lot easier doing other things and he

187
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,390
Speaker 8:  didn't. I think he was always motivated by making it the

188
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,350
Speaker 8:  impossible happen. I think he was still motivated by his feeling that

189
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,270
Speaker 8:  the earth was going to be destroyed and he was critical to

190
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,280
Speaker 8:  stopping that in some way.

191
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,660
Speaker 3:  Sounds great, but maybe a bit of a red flag too.

192
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,620
Speaker 8:  I think he had sort of a God complex. Only I can do it sounds like

193
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,920
Speaker 8:  Trump, right?

194
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,020
Speaker 3:  But as far as Eberhart and Tarponing were concerned, they had just gotten

195
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,580
Speaker 3:  their first check, six and a half million dollars as the

196
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,700
Speaker 3:  lead investor must became the chairman of the board and appointed his brother

197
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,300
Speaker 3:  and an old friend as directors. The founders took on executive

198
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,220
Speaker 3:  positions. Eberhart is c e o and Taring is C F O and VP of

199
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,240
Speaker 3:  engineering. With the new money coming in, they could finally hire people

200
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,890
Speaker 3:  to build their very first car, the Tesla Roadster.

201
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,380
Speaker 3:  Dave Lyons is one of those early hires. He was an elite engineer and Tesla

202
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,560
Speaker 3:  wanted him to lead development.

203
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,440
Speaker 11:  I got brought into a back room and they said, Hey look, we're starting

204
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,100
Speaker 11:  this car company, it's gonna be huge. You're either with us or Guinness.

205
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,000
Speaker 11:  Martin Everhart is a very fast talking guy and he was pretty

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,280
Speaker 11:  charismatic, I have to say. And then there was this other quiet guy, Elon

207
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,400
Speaker 11:  in the corner who really didn't say anything.

208
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,560
Speaker 3:  Lyons didn't know if electric cars had much of a future, but the room was

209
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,880
Speaker 3:  full of energy and potential and he knew a little bit about that quiet guy

210
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,790
Speaker 3:  and his ambitions. So he was intrigued.

211
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,000
Speaker 11:  Well, this guy's got a rocket company and, and he's saying this was gonna

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,360
Speaker 11:  take off. So I mean that pitch sold pretty well to

213
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,560
Speaker 11:  me.

214
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,480
Speaker 3:  Lyons became employee number 12, but Tesla would need a whole lot more people

215
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,980
Speaker 3:  like him before he could make anything, let alone a brand new kind of electric

216
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,960
Speaker 3:  car. Musk had faced this challenge before at SpaceX and he

217
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,160
Speaker 3:  had developed a sort of recruitment philosophy that seemed to work.

218
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,910
Speaker 11:  I remember one day he told us about his kind of, you know, his

219
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,200
Speaker 11:  view of the world where like all these companies are all bound up by all

220
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,960
Speaker 11:  this regulatory mess and they don't get to do the good ideas and the

221
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,280
Speaker 11:  young engineers that are working at these aerospace companies, they're,

222
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,250
Speaker 11:  you know, kinda low men on the totem pole with all these

223
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,220
Speaker 11:  older moon launch era managers

224
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,960
Speaker 11:  who kind of tell 'em what they can't do all the time. And he was saying,

225
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,900
Speaker 11:  I like what I wanna do is I'm gonna hire all those e energetic smart guys

226
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,950
Speaker 11:  and give 'em freedom to soar.

227
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,500
Speaker 3:  There were lessons here for Tesla. SpaceX plucked young, bright engineers

228
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,350
Speaker 3:  out of government jobs and gave them the freedom to innovate. Tesla

229
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,140
Speaker 3:  could do something similar, attract the most dynamic talent from the old

230
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,860
Speaker 3:  rigid auto companies with promises of creative empowerment and

231
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,700
Speaker 3:  equity for the next few years. The whole company was

232
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,560
Speaker 3:  focused on one goal launching the Roadster, the car that would announce Tesla

233
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,007
Speaker 3:  to the world that day finally came in July,

234
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:45,673
Speaker 3:  2006.

235
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,680
Speaker 12:  This is one of the great cars Tesla Roadster electric car that gets

236
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,400
Speaker 12:  250 miles per charge.

237
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,860
Speaker 3:  And of course the birthday party for a flashy sports car had a celebrity

238
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,740
Speaker 3:  guest list, including California's governor at the time. Arnold

239
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,180
Speaker 3:  Schwarzenegger, a

240
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,590
Speaker 12:  Tester of this one. It's hot,

241
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,630
Speaker 3:  White, hot, the Roadster was tear your face off

242
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,620
Speaker 3:  Quick. Eberhart as c e o

243
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,300
Speaker 3:  took the lead on planning the Roadster's public debut. He hired a publicist

244
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,270
Speaker 3:  to help out.

245
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,260
Speaker 9:  She's the one who put together the basic idea of what that launch event would

246
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,100
Speaker 9:  look like from the idea of having it at an airport and having a track

247
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,850
Speaker 9:  outside where people could drive to having the event held in a giant

248
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,660
Speaker 9:  tent where the track actually came in and people could see these cars coming

249
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,100
Speaker 9:  and going and, and line up and go for a ride. All of this, this, this was

250
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,210
Speaker 9:  basically her idea.

251
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,020
Speaker 3:  This wasn't just the debut of the Roadster prototype, it was also the debut

252
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,420
Speaker 3:  of Tesla. I

253
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,880
Speaker 9:  Went to show this idea to Elon down in, in LA

254
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,600
Speaker 9:  and he basically had me fire her on the spot.

255
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,080
Speaker 3:  Eberhard was taken aback. It was the first time Musk had ever done something

256
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,640
Speaker 3:  like this, reach into Eberhardt's company and demands someone be

257
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,440
Speaker 3:  fired. But Musk was adamant. Eberhard realized if he

258
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,760
Speaker 3:  wanted to, Musk could take it to the board and that was a fight he would've

259
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,720
Speaker 3:  lost. Over the previous two years, Musk had remained the lead funder

260
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,880
Speaker 3:  allowing him to stack the board with guy's loyal to himself. Not everyone

261
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,800
Speaker 3:  was a Musk guy, but the math didn't look good. So Everhard did what he

262
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,650
Speaker 3:  was told,

263
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,420
Speaker 9:  Which was heartbreaking for me. And then he hired his

264
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,360
Speaker 9:  own team of people to, to produce exactly the party that

265
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,960
Speaker 9:  she had had laid out. Exactly. So I, I didn't understand what that was about.

266
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,360
Speaker 9:  It was very strange.

267
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,620
Speaker 3:  Now, Everhard didn't always fold on key decisions, especially when it came

268
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,150
Speaker 3:  to building the cars, but he could see that this moment Tesla's

269
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,020
Speaker 3:  debut was very important to Musk. It was Tesla's

270
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,980
Speaker 3:  first big splash, the reveal of its first car and Musk seemed

271
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,460
Speaker 3:  Like. he had to be out in front there to take credit and absorb the limelight

272
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,800
Speaker 3:  as the face of the company.

273
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,660
Speaker 7:  The opportunity is is now and and the need is now to have a Co company

274
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,460
Speaker 7:  of this, of this nature.

275
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,060
Speaker 3:  Everhart says Musk became sort of obsessed with this idea. He remembers when

276
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,930
Speaker 3:  the New York Times first wrote about Tesla, it left out any reference to

277
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,860
Speaker 3:  Musk and he was furious. By the way, we've reached out

278
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,580
Speaker 3:  to Elon, Musk and Tesla about this and other stuff we never heard

279
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,740
Speaker 3:  back. It's worth noting that Tesla doesn't even have someone who handles

280
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,700
Speaker 3:  media requests anymore. Anyways, Musk had inserted himself into the

281
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,870
Speaker 3:  process of making the car as well. Small stuff mostly.

282
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,180
Speaker 9:  There were a lot of little sort of random interventions that he would come

283
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,170
Speaker 9:  in and say, I want this change or whatever, like

284
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,980
Speaker 3:  Door handles. He was determined that the doors on the Roadster should not

285
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,280
Speaker 3:  open with a handle, but with a button.

286
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,970
Speaker 9:  The motorized door handles on the Roadster, you know, they're

287
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,420
Speaker 9:  cool, but they were also quite tricky to get right

288
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,140
Speaker 9:  because the door latches on a car, have to work correctly even after it's

289
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,240
Speaker 9:  crashed. And if the power goes out, then how does the electric thing work?

290
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,180
Speaker 9:  And we, we wound up spending some number of millions of dollars to

291
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,610
Speaker 9:  get that to work right, and to get it to to, to pass the side impact crash

292
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,400
Speaker 9:  test.

293
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,920
Speaker 3:  And it wasn't just door handles. Must decree, the seats weren't comfortable

294
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,060
Speaker 3:  and the doorframe needed adjustments and the headlights didn't look cool

295
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,820
Speaker 3:  enough. Meanwhile, the company had much bigger

296
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,690
Speaker 3:  problems than door handles. And it wasn't due to Musk's medley

297
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,980
Speaker 9:  That was over budget and and behind schedule on the

298
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,900
Speaker 9:  project.

299
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,500
Speaker 3:  Sourcing parts for a tiny car startup and an electric one no less was

300
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,420
Speaker 3:  extremely difficult. Suppliers were reluctant to sell just a few parts to

301
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,180
Speaker 3:  a small company that might not even exist within a year. But also

302
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,060
Speaker 3:  things like heating or air conditioning that played nice with Ev tech. There

303
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,180
Speaker 3:  was almost no demand for these parts. So they weren't widely available. You

304
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,480
Speaker 3:  couldn't just put in an order and expect a shipment.

305
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,060
Speaker 9:  If you could ask me what was the thing that was the most surprising to me,

306
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,860
Speaker 9:  the thing I was not expecting that was how hard was the supply chain problem

307
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,290
Speaker 9:  I had. I just, I just didn't, didn't expect it to be that difficult.

308
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,400
Speaker 3:  They were a whole year behind schedule and the car was shaping up to cost

309
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,200
Speaker 3:  way more to produce than they had ever planned to sell it for.

310
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
Speaker 9:  It was getting to be clear that I was maybe

311
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,330
Speaker 9:  not the right guy to be the c e o for the company for a long time to

312
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,230
Speaker 9:  myself.

313
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,050
Speaker 3:  So Eberhard began the search for his replacement, which was fine. He looked

314
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,970
Speaker 3:  forward to working on something else At Tesla,

315
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,810
Speaker 9:  I would've taken a role of, as you know, C T O or vice president

316
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,770
Speaker 9:  of whatever, blah. Anyways, but someplace where I'm spending most of my time

317
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,650
Speaker 9:  working on the technology or on evangelizing the company, that was,

318
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,370
Speaker 9:  that was what I imagined. That's what we, what we had discussed with the

319
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,470
Speaker 9:  board of directors.

320
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,450
Speaker 3:  But Musk had something else in mind. A few months into the search for

321
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,290
Speaker 3:  a new c e o, Eberhard got a call from Musk. He'd found someone who

322
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,190
Speaker 3:  might work as Eberhardt's replacement.

323
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,790
Speaker 9:  He came across as though this is a friendly suggestion. After

324
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,210
Speaker 3:  All, it was Eberhard who was leading his own replacement effort. This was

325
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,790
Speaker 3:  just a suggestion, right?

326
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,570
Speaker 9:  And then I learned basically the next day through email that the board had

327
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,530
Speaker 9:  basically voted me off the island.

328
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,080
Speaker 3:  Eberhard was out as c e o Musk's Pick was in

329
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,490
Speaker 3:  Eberhardt's own search for a new c e o looked like kind of a

330
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,350
Speaker 3:  sham, and the assurance that he'd always have a role at Tesla was now totally

331
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,570
Speaker 3:  in question.

332
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,450
Speaker 9:  It felt like a brick on the side of my head. I

333
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,250
Speaker 9:  felt it felt like I got hit on the side of my head with a brick. It was totally

334
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,310
Speaker 9:  unexpected

335
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,210
Speaker 3:  And there was nothing he could do about it. The company that had sprung from

336
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,930
Speaker 3:  Eberhardt's desire to drive a better sports car was now completely out of

337
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,880
Speaker 3:  his control.

338
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,290
Speaker 9:  Keep in mind, who was on the board of directors? It was Elon, right? It was

339
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,890
Speaker 9:  his brother. Okay. He's kind of aligned. It was Antonio Rossius, who was

340
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,570
Speaker 9:  an old buddy of his, who had made a lot of money off of previous investments

341
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,720
Speaker 9:  with Elon.

342
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,170
Speaker 3:  Musk controlled half the board. Eberhard says he asked for the board to vote

343
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,730
Speaker 3:  again this time with him, present the result, a

344
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,370
Speaker 3:  demotion to the made up role of president of technology. No one

345
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,010
Speaker 3:  reporting to him, no responsibilities. But even that wouldn't last very

346
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,090
Speaker 3:  long.

347
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,950
Speaker 9:  I was asked to resign. Well, for me it was,

348
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,450
Speaker 9:  it was, it was really sad. Yeah,

349
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,090
Speaker 3:  His co-founder, mark Tarting, left shortly after that.

350
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,030
Speaker 3:  If Everhart sounds a little muted, it's because he has to be. He sued

351
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,560
Speaker 3:  Musk and Tesla claiming liable defamation, breach of contract,

352
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,110
Speaker 3:  infliction of emotional distress, and failure to pay his wages. Among other

353
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,430
Speaker 3:  things. The lawsuit was settled out of court.

354
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,210
Speaker 9:  I have a mutual non-disparagement agreement signed with Musk,

355
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,990
Speaker 9:  and although he's been flagrantly violating that agreement

356
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,830
Speaker 9:  over and over and over again, he's also the richest man in the

357
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,660
Speaker 9:  world and if he decides to crush me with lawsuits, I can't survive it.

358
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,390
Speaker 3:  Tesla's founders were out. Musk had personally picked a new c e

359
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,910
Speaker 3:  o, but really by then he was running the show. There

360
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,850
Speaker 11:  Was a new sheriff in town, no doubt about that, and he

361
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,130
Speaker 11:  was quite drastic,

362
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,350
Speaker 3:  But even that wasn't quite

363
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,290
Speaker 3:  enough

364
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,110
Speaker 3:  coming up how Elon. Musk made Tesla synonymous with Elon.

365
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:39,640
Speaker 3:  Musk

366
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,900
Speaker 13:  Okay. Okay.

367
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,880
Speaker 3:  Wolves and dogs are pretty closely related. They actually

368
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,580
Speaker 3:  share 99.9% of their genetics

369
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,420
Speaker 14:  Yo sniffles,

370
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,880
Speaker 3:  But even when they're just a few months old, even when they're raised by

371
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,550
Speaker 3:  human scientists, wolves are pretty different from dogs.

372
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,480
Speaker 14:  They start biting you in the ears when you find down. If you don't

373
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,600
Speaker 14:  sit up fast enough and you hear this wonderful noise, these

374
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,800
Speaker 14:  little, and then they chomp you in the air and you're like,

375
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,020
Speaker 14:  oh.

376
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,540
Speaker 3:  And when they grow up, these differences get even

377
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,180
Speaker 3:  bigger. Dogs are our friends.

378
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,020
Speaker 3:  Wolves are hunters.

379
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,640
Speaker 14:  If I had a sore shoulder, I wouldn't go in with the

380
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,480
Speaker 14:  adult wolves, even if I had raised them because it could trigger their hunting

381
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,870
Speaker 14:  behavior.

382
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:32,740
Speaker 3:  This week on unexplainable, how did we get the nice friendly dogs

383
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,480
Speaker 3:  we know and love today from wolves? Follow

384
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,160
Speaker 3:  unexplainable wherever you listen for new episodes every

385
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,030
Speaker 3:  Wednesday.

386
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,980
Speaker 15:  A moment from American Idol recently went viral in which

387
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,880
Speaker 15:  one of the show's contestants got under Judge Katy Perry's

388
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,560
Speaker 15:  skin with the way she sang, slurring her words

389
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,520
Speaker 15:  together, dropping whole consonants, playing with vowels like they

390
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,160
Speaker 15:  were silly putty annunciate. Perry begged the

391
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,000
Speaker 15:  contestant. This exchange likely went viral because it

392
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,920
Speaker 15:  crystallized a vocal phenomenon in pop music that has as

393
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,900
Speaker 15:  many supporters as it does detractors. Like Perry. The style

394
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,400
Speaker 15:  has been dubbed cursive singing because of the way it

395
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,280
Speaker 15:  smoothly blurs lyrics together like the penmanship technique and it

396
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,040
Speaker 15:  can be heard in hits from stars like Selena Gomez and

397
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,920
Speaker 15:  Sean Mendes. I'm musicologist Nate Sloan, co-host of the Vulture

398
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,840
Speaker 15:  Music podcast Switched on pop, and on this week's episode, we are

399
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,470
Speaker 15:  diving deep into the techniques and the origins behind

400
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,370
Speaker 15:  this marble mouthed vocal fad To better understand

401
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,680
Speaker 15:  where cursive singing came from, why it's so

402
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,440
Speaker 15:  divisive, and whether this style is here to

403
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:55,120
Speaker 15:  stay.

404
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,000
Speaker 16:  Watch me take off.

405
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,870
Speaker 3:  Tesla started delivering the Roadster in 2008. Late night legend and

406
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,850
Speaker 3:  famous car guy Jay Leno. Got to test drive one and he was an instant fan.

407
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,490
Speaker 18:  You know, the thing that's fascinated me about this car is you've eliminated

408
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,680
Speaker 18:  all the negatives of an electric cuck. A lot of times

409
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,470
Speaker 3:  Tesla proved it can make an EV that didn't feel like a punishment car. The

410
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,110
Speaker 3:  Roadster cost as much as a Porsche nine 11, but it could keep up with one

411
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,910
Speaker 3:  too, and it didn't use gasoline. The founders were

412
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,890
Speaker 3:  gone, but their dream had become a reality and Tesla's engineering team

413
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,010
Speaker 3:  was primed to work on the next challenge.

414
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,790
Speaker 11:  And all the engineers, not just some of the engineers, all the

415
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,790
Speaker 11:  engineers wanted to work on the cool new high volume

416
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,860
Speaker 11:  project.

417
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,640
Speaker 3:  They knew exactly what it would be. A luxury sedan. The

418
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,520
Speaker 3:  model Ss. This was the plan going back to Eberhardt and Tarpon's

419
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,480
Speaker 3:  original business proposal. The team was ready to go, but their timing could

420
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,060
Speaker 3:  not have been worse.

421
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,460
Speaker 19:  The economy went into absolute free fall.

422
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,360
Speaker 3:  That's Rachel Conrad, who was the only person on Tesla's PR team. As the

423
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,310
Speaker 3:  company faced the Great Recession.

424
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,800
Speaker 19:  This was the peak. Lehman Brothers liquidity

425
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,680
Speaker 19:  freeze. Both General Motors and

426
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,590
Speaker 19:  Chrysler declared bankruptcy. This was called

427
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,360
Speaker 19:  Carmageddon, right? It was literally the worst

428
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,520
Speaker 19:  downfall in the auto industry for a couple of

429
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,830
Speaker 19:  generations.

430
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,800
Speaker 3:  This is no exaggeration. Analysts at the time fully expected at least one

431
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,480
Speaker 3:  of the big three American automakers to go out of business At. this

432
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,280
Speaker 3:  point, Musk's handpicked replacement for Everhart had already bounced, another,

433
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,600
Speaker 3:  followed, but didn't last long either. Ultimately, Musk looked around and

434
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,110
Speaker 3:  decided the crown belonged on his own head. He named

435
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,900
Speaker 3:  himself c e o

436
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,860
Speaker 19:  In December of 2008. Tesla literally had

437
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,840
Speaker 19:  one day of cash runway before they would have to enter the

438
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,940
Speaker 19:  zone of insolvency and they would just flame out.

439
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,610
Speaker 3:  It was a kingdom in trouble still. Tesla closed out the year with a holiday

440
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,700
Speaker 3:  party.

441
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,540
Speaker 19:  We could not rent a place. We didn't even have a caterer. We literally

442
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,370
Speaker 19:  set up tables in the

443
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,100
Speaker 19:  Tesla garage in Menlo Park.

444
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,390
Speaker 3:  So there they were sitting in some folding chairs in front of a hydraulic

445
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,620
Speaker 3:  lift, drinking cheap wine and wondering if the company would last another

446
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,790
Speaker 3:  day.

447
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,640
Speaker 19:  And Elon stands on a table

448
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,320
Speaker 19:  literally and says,

449
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,290
Speaker 19:  guys, we just shifted in

450
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,150
Speaker 19:  America from having a Texas oil man

451
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,390
Speaker 19:  who was president to an

452
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,180
Speaker 19:  environmentalist named Barack Obama, who has

453
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,050
Speaker 19:  vowed not to just help the auto industry at large, but

454
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,610
Speaker 19:  to specifically accelerate the shift to

455
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,350
Speaker 19:  electrification. If you can't

456
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,800
Speaker 19:  see the opportunity in that, you are not looking.

457
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,690
Speaker 3:  This story about Musk feels like a freeze frame in a movie. The moment

458
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,570
Speaker 3:  before the man is made, well, before Musk becomes the richest person on the

459
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,530
Speaker 3:  planet before he even becomes famous, before he gets a

460
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,450
Speaker 3:  Twitter account with tweets that move markets in this

461
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,210
Speaker 3:  moment, he's just trying to move people enough to stay in their

462
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,050
Speaker 3:  jobs. For Conrad, who'd been on the job just a few months, it

463
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,990
Speaker 3:  was a moment of clarity. Musk made it seem like anything was possible.

464
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,290
Speaker 3:  He seemed brilliant, he had a vision, he was in

465
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,830
Speaker 3:  control,

466
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,210
Speaker 19:  And the way he said it was so fucking

467
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,050
Speaker 19:  powerful that everyone in there, he had

468
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,850
Speaker 19:  us all like none of us were about to abandon ship.

469
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,610
Speaker 19:  At that moment.

470
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,320
Speaker 3:  Musk kept Tesla float by injecting his own money in the company.

471
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,140
Speaker 20:  My salary is minimum wage, you know, so I'm a

472
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,200
Speaker 20:  volunteer. Basically,

473
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,520
Speaker 3:  He was even writing personal checks to cover payroll and charging work expenses

474
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,240
Speaker 3:  to his credit card.

475
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,820
Speaker 19:  The doors of Sandhill Road, the epicenter of the global venture

476
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,450
Speaker 19:  capital industry were bolted shut.

477
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,820
Speaker 19:  Okay? Nobody would give Elon a

478
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,660
Speaker 19:  penny. Elon Musk, the most brilliant technologist who

479
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,360
Speaker 19:  ever lived, right? The one who all VCs kiss his ass.

480
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,840
Speaker 19:  Now, none of them would give him a penny.

481
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,580
Speaker 3:  Around that same time, he found another audience, one that was willing to

482
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,350
Speaker 3:  listen. He got a Twitter account

483
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,680
Speaker 19:  Almost immediately because of his

484
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,470
Speaker 19:  history with PayPal, et cetera. He, he

485
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,910
Speaker 19:  had a bit of a following.

486
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:29,530
Speaker 3:  He didn't tweet much at first. Updates about his companies recommending books.

487
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,110
Speaker 3:  He liked

488
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,850
Speaker 19:  To be able to harness very, very low cost

489
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,170
Speaker 19:  channels to talk directly to consumers,

490
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,640
Speaker 19:  policymakers, regulators, thought leaders, media, et

491
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,030
Speaker 19:  cetera is very high leverage.

492
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,440
Speaker 3:  Twitter offered Musk something that couldn't be bought.

493
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,280
Speaker 8:  I think Musk's insight was that he didn't just need to

494
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,160
Speaker 8:  speak to media. He could also speak directly to his audience

495
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,460
Speaker 8:  through social media.

496
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,700
Speaker 3:  Here's Liz Lipato from The Verge again.

497
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,400
Speaker 8:  And that creates the kind of direct

498
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,620
Speaker 8:  relationship that all of

499
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,360
Speaker 8:  the news interviews in the world can't

500
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,240
Speaker 8:  create. Because Elon Musk reads

501
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,460
Speaker 8:  his replies

502
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,120
Speaker 3:  Musk's Twitter, like no other c e o at the time. He didn't consult his publicist

503
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,940
Speaker 3:  to craft each tweet or hold focus groups on how to engage with his followers.

504
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,130
Speaker 3:  He shot from the hip and said what was on his mind.

505
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,700
Speaker 8:  There was a kind of un guardedness there that I think people are really related

506
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,280
Speaker 8:  to, and it creates a kind of closeness. Musk very much

507
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,720
Speaker 8:  became a star of the social media age by being

508
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,700
Speaker 8:  available.

509
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,600
Speaker 3:  So in public, Musk was cultivating a fan base for himself, lapping up all

510
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,000
Speaker 3:  the credit for this ambitious new car company. The

511
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,840
Speaker 18:  Man behind the whole project is here. Elon, Musk, Elon, come on in here.

512
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,540
Speaker 18:  How you doing?

513
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,250
Speaker 21:  So clearly you have many aspirations and an overwhelming

514
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,260
Speaker 21:  drive to innovate.

515
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,900
Speaker 22:  You are establishing a presence, certainly with Tesla

516
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,260
Speaker 22:  Motors, this electric car company.

517
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,160
Speaker 3:  He had proven to be just as persuasive in private. Musk, got some of those

518
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,100
Speaker 3:  reluctant investors to loosen up and he got enough cash to prevent bankruptcy.

519
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,120
Speaker 3:  The government also came through with a half billion dollar loan to flow

520
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,440
Speaker 3:  Tesla through the collapse. And then the company raised even more money by

521
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,840
Speaker 3:  going public. In 2010, Musk had managed to save the

522
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,830
Speaker 3:  company, and in 2012, Tesla released a new model.

523
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,190
Speaker 23:  This is a historic automobile. At a historic

524
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,970
Speaker 23:  time,

525
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,080
Speaker 3:  There was nothing else. Like the model Ss on the market. Tesla

526
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,070
Speaker 24:  Definitely was making waves.

527
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,980
Speaker 3:  Christina Raw joined Tesla's PR team to help launch the model Ss.

528
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,200
Speaker 24:  And so more and more coverage on Tesla, more and more

529
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,140
Speaker 24:  curiosity, much desire to get a peek under the hood.

530
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,560
Speaker 24:  And in parallel, Elon was starting to use Twitter more and

531
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,620
Speaker 24:  more.

532
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,560
Speaker 3:  Musk's tweets became the thing to watch for all things Tesla. He'd make

533
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,840
Speaker 3:  surprise announcements about new features or updates to the cars. Sometimes

534
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,800
Speaker 3:  in a reply to another user, it was chaotic, unpredictable, and

535
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,850
Speaker 3:  captivating.

536
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,410
Speaker 24:  There was definitely something that happened in those early

537
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,290
Speaker 24:  years that has continued, I think on to today,

538
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,910
Speaker 24:  where his accessibility created

539
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,740
Speaker 24:  more interest in the products.

540
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,320
Speaker 3:  Plenty of cars have avid fan bases, Ford, Mustangs, Jeep

541
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,880
Speaker 3:  Wranglers, even the humble Volkswagen Beetle. But the people in the C-suite

542
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,720
Speaker 3:  rarely get the same love their products get. Musk was different. He

543
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,960
Speaker 3:  made Tesla feel like a movement, and he was the leader of that

544
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,880
Speaker 3:  movement.

545
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,090
Speaker 24:  I think there was a phenomenon happening where people learned more about

546
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,510
Speaker 24:  Tesla and SpaceX, but really this person behind

547
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,980
Speaker 24:  them whom they found fascinating

548
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,920
Speaker 24:  and really attributed the products and the company's

549
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,780
Speaker 24:  successes to, and they became sort of Elon believers.

550
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,520
Speaker 3:  If Musk was the high priest prophesizing the future, then Twitter was where

551
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,350
Speaker 3:  he took people to church.

552
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,160
Speaker 25:  This guy's a real treat, and it took me a while to get him to come

553
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,870
Speaker 25:  here, but he's a really interesting entrepreneur,

554
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,740
Speaker 25:  very much a visionary. Many people think in space

555
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,710
Speaker 25:  and in cars and in all solar, solar, all kinds of things.

556
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,660
Speaker 25:  Elon Musk.

557
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,510
Speaker 3:  But everything worked towards cultivating a faith in him. Elon

558
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,480
Speaker 3:  Musk, that same faith we heard about from Rachel Conrad and

559
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,230
Speaker 3:  his believers were everywhere. They were the kids online forming

560
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,890
Speaker 3:  Elon, Musk fan groups. They were also deep pocketed investors.

561
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,730
Speaker 3:  Tesla had never made a profit as a company, but as Musk's believer,

562
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,780
Speaker 3:  count took off. So did Tesla's stock price.

563
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,760
Speaker 26:  If you look at Q one, Tesla grew about 1,700 and something

564
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,220
Speaker 26:  percent, and there's a lot of potential for this company

565
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,760
Speaker 26:  to continue to grow, and for the company itself to double and double and

566
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,790
Speaker 26:  double again.

567
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,380
Speaker 3:  Elon has been a big part in the investment in Tesla in the past, current

568
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,200
Speaker 3:  and future. This is Tesla investor, Ross Gerber, and what he's saying

569
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,080
Speaker 3:  is that his decision to invest in Tesla in 2014 was also a decision to

570
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,800
Speaker 3:  invest in Musk. It paid off pretty quickly for

571
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,160
Speaker 3:  us, and we were able to take profits off our original

572
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,960
Speaker 3:  investment pretty rapidly. Over the years, Musk's

573
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,580
Speaker 3:  followers were used to seeing a particular mix of his personality.

574
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,540
Speaker 8:  90% of him was really inspirational and aspirational,

575
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,740
Speaker 8:  and 10% was kind of a jerk.

576
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,020
Speaker 3:  And when he went into jerk mode, you never knew what you were gonna get.

577
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,000
Speaker 8:  His humor was a little juvenile for my taste, but I would say that about

578
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,490
Speaker 8:  three dozen people I cover and he more than others, like

579
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,760
Speaker 8:  memes. He thought it, things were hysterical that I didn't think were

580
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,940
Speaker 8:  hysterical.

581
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,240
Speaker 3:  One time a group of boys and their soccer coach had gotten trapped in a cave

582
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,200
Speaker 3:  in Thailand. A rescue diver was leading efforts to save them, and Musk

583
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,730
Speaker 3:  offered to build a submarine to help the diver called it a PR

584
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:39,480
Speaker 3:  stunt. He told Musk to quote, stick his submarine where it

585
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,100
Speaker 3:  hurts. So Musk hopped on Twitter to clap back.

586
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,320
Speaker 27:  You know what? Don't bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini

587
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,260
Speaker 27:  sub pod going all the way to K five. No promo. Sorry, pedo guy.

588
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,240
Speaker 27:  You really did ask for it. By the way, I'm not actually Elon Musk, I'm

589
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,670
Speaker 27:  an AI reading his tweets.

590
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,610
Speaker 3:  Did the c e o of a company just flippantly call a man a

591
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,370
Speaker 3:  pedophile? When another user pointed this out to him, Musk doubled

592
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,290
Speaker 3:  down. Bet

593
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,950
Speaker 27:  Your signed dollar. It's true.

594
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,240
Speaker 3:  The diver sued him for defamation, but Musk won the

595
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,220
Speaker 3:  lawsuit. Musk also got in trouble for his tweets about Tesla.

596
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,620
Speaker 3:  He once sent a series of coy, but confidence sounding tweets about taking

597
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,420
Speaker 3:  the company private. The s e c was not having it. It charged

598
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,220
Speaker 3:  him with securities fraud for essentially lying and misleading his shareholders.

599
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,200
Speaker 3:  So his Twitter feed was a mix, his special recipe of the provocative and

600
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,310
Speaker 3:  unfiltered.

601
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,030
Speaker 8:  What was problematic for me is that he started to become

602
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,060
Speaker 8:  sort of high on his own supply

603
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,500
Speaker 3:  For Swisher and many others. His tweets drifted more and more into topics

604
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,320
Speaker 3:  wholly unrelated to cars or space or tech. The meanness started

605
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,890
Speaker 3:  to take over. He started sharing conspiracy theories, promoting

606
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,700
Speaker 3:  anti-trans tropes and cozying up to far right-wing personalities.

607
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,120
Speaker 3:  If any other c e O did this stuff, they'd be strapped to a rocket and fired

608
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,110
Speaker 3:  into the sun. But a lot of his fans have been willing to overlook this

609
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,780
Speaker 3:  stuff because even if he was an asshole, he was still an aspirational

610
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,750
Speaker 3:  asshole. His companies were changing the world. He was literally the

611
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,500
Speaker 3:  richest person in the world, his brand, and by extension,

612
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,190
Speaker 3:  Tesla's brand was still pretty solid.

613
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,770
Speaker 8:  I think the Twitter acquisition was actually a really big turning point in

614
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,570
Speaker 8:  how people viewed Elon Musk.

615
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,420
Speaker 3:  Here's Liz Lipato again.

616
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,200
Speaker 8:  Sure, he was attention seeking and sure, he occasionally said like weird

617
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,770
Speaker 8:  stuff in public. But to discover his flaws as a businessman,

618
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,630
Speaker 8:  you actually needed to be paying pretty close attention to what was going

619
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,930
Speaker 8:  on at Tesla.

620
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:33,260
Speaker 3:  But buying Twitter read to just about everyone as a pretty massive

621
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,670
Speaker 3:  mistake. The purchase itself was a spectacular business.

622
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,480
Speaker 3:  Blunder. Musk offered to buy the company for way more than it was worth.

623
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,990
Speaker 3:  Tried to back out and then was basically forced by a court to finish the

624
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,570
Speaker 3:  deal

625
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,270
Speaker 8:  And then immediately like alienated a large percentage of the

626
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,710
Speaker 8:  advertisers and drove a bunch of users away and like sort of drove the

627
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,180
Speaker 8:  thing into the ground.

628
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,950
Speaker 3:  Twitter was bleeding value. This humiliation was being broadcast

629
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,890
Speaker 3:  everywhere, including on the platform that helped build his fandom, the one

630
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,430
Speaker 3:  he now owned. Those

631
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,620
Speaker 8:  Were not good business decisions that these things were being made

632
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,110
Speaker 8:  impulsively. These ideas were not

633
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,990
Speaker 8:  necessarily good, but there was no one around him to

634
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,690
Speaker 8:  say no to him.

635
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,660
Speaker 3:  It was complete chaos and it was Musk's fault. This

636
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,120
Speaker 3:  was almost a fun house mirror image of what happened after the Tesla founder

637
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,000
Speaker 3:  Red Wedding went down. Musk led a coup that essentially off

638
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,960
Speaker 3:  the founders, and then he ably steered the company through the financial

639
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,440
Speaker 3:  collapse. He took a tiny startup and made it into a real car

640
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,380
Speaker 3:  brand. He built his own brand on doing this kind of thing.

641
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,320
Speaker 3:  Now everyone was taking a hard look at the legend of Elon Musk. The

642
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,060
Speaker 8:  Rich liberals are like, what the fuck am I giving this guy money for? I have

643
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,790
Speaker 8:  dozens of my friends are like, I wanna get rid of my Tesla.

644
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,320
Speaker 3:  Ever since he bought Twitter, he's been obsessed with

645
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,850
Speaker 3:  it and it hasn't been good for him.

646
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:58,720
Speaker 3:  Tesla investor, Ross Gerber again. And so what's happened over

647
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,620
Speaker 3:  the last six months to a year, which has been really distressing to me,

648
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,420
Speaker 3:  is that the public opinion, at least in my area

649
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,670
Speaker 3:  of the world, has changed to decidedly negative about

650
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,560
Speaker 3:  Elon, and that hasn't been good for Tesla. There's this closely

651
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,220
Speaker 3:  watched poll that Axios puts out every year. It ranks the reputations of

652
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,760
Speaker 3:  100 different companies. Tesla fell 50 spots from last

653
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,600
Speaker 3:  year, an enormous drop. Why? People side

654
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,240
Speaker 3:  eye the company's character, culture, and ethics. Now, this poll doesn't

655
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,920
Speaker 3:  tell us why people are suddenly questioning Tesla, but not much has changed

656
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,260
Speaker 3:  with the cars. Musk had worked hard to make Tesla

657
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,080
Speaker 3:  nearly synonymous with himself. He created structures that helped him

658
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,000
Speaker 3:  seize power and keep it. He built the company's brand by harnessing

659
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,720
Speaker 3:  his own on social media and all that. It worked for

660
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,520
Speaker 3:  Tesla until it didn't. The brand has taken a

661
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,320
Speaker 3:  hit. Musk has become a polarizing figure in a way he never was

662
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,240
Speaker 3:  before. The shareholders have gotten restless. This might

663
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,760
Speaker 3:  have been a potential turning point, A moment where he reassessed how his

664
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,860
Speaker 3:  public persona played into the future of Tesla.

665
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,380
Speaker 28:  You know, do your tweets hurt the company?

666
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,050
Speaker 20:  It was a scene in the Princess Bride, great movie,

667
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,000
Speaker 20:  great movie where he confronts

668
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,560
Speaker 20:  the person who killed his father. And he says, offer me

669
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,160
Speaker 20:  money, offer me

670
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,510
Speaker 20:  power. I don't

671
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,860
Speaker 20:  care.

672
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,780
Speaker 3:  But the reality is, he might have to care at least a little

673
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,750
Speaker 3:  bit. Musk did hire someone else to serve as the c e O of Twitter.

674
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,040
Speaker 3:  Perhaps a nod to his Tesla shareholders who have begged for a little more

675
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,860
Speaker 3:  of his attention, but will he curb his toxic brand of tweeting?

676
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,760
Speaker 29:  So I've got 127 million followers. It continues

677
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,480
Speaker 29:  to grow very rapidly. That

678
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,400
Speaker 29:  suggests that I'm, you know, reasonably

679
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,280
Speaker 29:  popular. Now, might not be popular by

680
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,010
Speaker 29:  some people, but for the vast majority of

681
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,770
Speaker 29:  people, my follow account speaks for itself. I think Twitter is actually

682
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,330
Speaker 29:  an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for

683
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,620
Speaker 29:  Tesla.

684
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,520
Speaker 3:  Maybe, maybe not, but Musk knows about control.

685
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,370
Speaker 3:  He's learned how to hold onto a company. So even if his personal brand is

686
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,050
Speaker 3:  now hurting Tesla's, it's not clear who could stop

687
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:24,800
Speaker 3:  him.

688
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,900
Speaker 3:  Next week we're gonna take a look at Tesla's competition. Finally,

689
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,890
Speaker 5:  Other automakers are starting to realize Tesla's here, we need to get

690
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,150
Speaker 5:  here also. And they are.

691
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,630
Speaker 3:  And we're gonna find out who's making the best electric vehicles right now.

692
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,970
Speaker 30:  You are now competing with luxury brands like Volvo.

693
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,200
Speaker 30:  Mercedes b m w.

694
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,690
Speaker 31:  Tesla's used to look cool and now they don't, and they've

695
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,810
Speaker 31:  become the Uber car of the

696
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,000
Speaker 31:  city,

697
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,730
