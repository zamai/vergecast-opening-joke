Description: David has a Light Phone III, and it's making him wonder a lot of things about technology. So The Verge's Allison Johnson joins the show to talk about the whole trend of minimalist smartphones, and to figure out which features a smartphone absolutely needs, and which ones we could all probably do without. After that, The Verge's Andy Hawkins takes us through a big weekend in the Tesla Takedown movement, what's happening with Elon Musk's car company, how automakers are responding to impending tariffs, and whether we're wrong to be excited about the new Nissan Leaf. Finally, The Verge's Jen Tuohy answers a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11, or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about all-seeing cameras in our homes. Which mostly don't exist yet. Mostly.

00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:06,915
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of automotive

3
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:10,675
Speaker 1:  tariff coverage. Somehow. That's true. Didn't really

4
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:14,395
Speaker 1:  set out to do that here, and yet sometimes that's what we do.

5
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:18,395
Speaker 1:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am sitting here on a very

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:22,355
Speaker 1:  warm afternoon trying to decide how far into

7
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:26,515
Speaker 1:  the light phone three life I'm ready to go. So

8
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,555
Speaker 1:  I have the light phone three. If you don't know about the light phone, it's

9
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:33,395
Speaker 1:  basically this sort of decade old project from this company called

10
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:37,155
Speaker 1:  Light, trying to figure out like, what is the least amount of

11
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:40,955
Speaker 1:  phone irregular person need needs. So if you think about it, it's like,

12
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:43,475
Speaker 1:  okay, you need a phone that makes phone calls. You need a phone that sends

13
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:47,155
Speaker 1:  text messages. You probably need some kind of navigation. I think in 2025.

14
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:51,035
Speaker 1:  You need a camera. What else? What do you need? That isn't

15
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:54,595
Speaker 1:  social media. It isn't web browsing. It isn't all the distracting, problematic

16
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:58,195
Speaker 1:  stuff we're actually trying to get rid of on our phones and do less of.

17
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:01,435
Speaker 1:  What if you could just have a phone that did the essentials and nothing else?

18
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:06,075
Speaker 1:  I've been using this phone for a while, and it's not all the way there,

19
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:09,515
Speaker 1:  but it's pretty close, and I think it's close in some really interesting

20
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:13,275
Speaker 1:  ways. But the thing for me is like, I, I'm just not gonna stop using a

21
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:16,355
Speaker 1:  smartphone. Part of the thing is like, I do this for a living, right? Like,

22
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,955
Speaker 1:  I, I read a newsletter every week about apps. I'm not gonna stop using

23
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:24,115
Speaker 1:  a smartphone anytime soon, but I do like the idea of like a nights

24
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:27,355
Speaker 1:  and weekends phone or a way that I can just

25
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:32,195
Speaker 1:  disappear for a few hours, even if I'm like out walking the dog. Can I

26
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:35,715
Speaker 1:  take something with me that isn't my smartphone, but It is still a way for

27
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:39,395
Speaker 1:  me to be able to keep in touch with people who I need to be in touch with.

28
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:43,795
Speaker 1:  So what I'm trying to figure out is like, can I port my sim card? Does the

29
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:47,675
Speaker 1:  EIM swap stuff work? It turns out it's all very complicated, and I think

30
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:51,595
Speaker 1:  the real reason you can't do this stuff is because of carriers. But

31
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:55,155
Speaker 1:  I'm, I'm pressing along. I'm going to try and figure this out. If you have

32
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:59,115
Speaker 1:  figured this out, how to have a smartphone and another phone, and

33
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:02,075
Speaker 1:  you figured that out in a way that actually like works for you, I am all

34
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:05,955
Speaker 1:  ears. I would very much like to hear from you. But anyway, that is not what

35
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:08,635
Speaker 1:  we're here to talk about on the show today, although it's a little bit what

36
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:11,675
Speaker 1:  we're here to talk about on the show today. First thing we're gonna do today

37
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:15,435
Speaker 1:  is I'm gonna talk with Allison Johnson about these minimalist smartphones,

38
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,875
Speaker 1:  and we're gonna try to figure out together what the right balance of

39
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:23,115
Speaker 1:  features and chaos and screen time is actually

40
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:26,235
Speaker 1:  the right set of things. I have a bunch of stuff we're gonna go through.

41
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:30,035
Speaker 1:  We're gonna try and figure it out. We're also gonna talk to Andy Hawkins

42
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:33,995
Speaker 1:  about the Tesla Takedown protest, which was having a big day this

43
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:37,915
Speaker 1:  weekend, plus what's going on with the automotive tariffs. This is a,

44
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:41,715
Speaker 1:  a sort of strange uncertain week for the auto industry, and

45
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:44,915
Speaker 1:  there's a lot to talk through. So we're gonna talk through it. Plus we have

46
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,635
Speaker 1:  a really fun question from the first cast hotline. Lots to do, lots to get

47
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,515
Speaker 1:  to, but It is like 70 degrees outside. And I still have

48
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:56,235
Speaker 1:  some testing to do on this thing. So I'm gonna go call my mom on the light

49
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:59,350
Speaker 1:  phone. It's gonna be great. This is the first cast. We'll be right back.

50
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:51,175
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Allison Johnson's here. Hi, Allison. Hello. I have

51
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:54,855
Speaker 1:  prepared a whole thing for us and I have prepared you. Not at all.

52
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:56,135
Speaker 6:  It's very exciting.

53
00:04:56,555 --> 00:05:00,375
Speaker 1:  Are you, are you ready? Yes. So I've been using the light phone three

54
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:03,575
Speaker 1:  for the last week or so. I have it here. Ooh. I have a lot of feelings about

55
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:07,415
Speaker 1:  it. I find this phone deeply fascinating, and the thing that I

56
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:10,855
Speaker 1:  have been trying to figure out as I've been using this phone is basically

57
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:14,575
Speaker 1:  like, what is the least a phone

58
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:17,415
Speaker 1:  should be able to do in 2025? Like,

59
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:22,335
Speaker 1:  I, I, first, I want to get your sort of overall stance on

60
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,975
Speaker 1:  this kind of theory of a device that you can like, do some

61
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:29,935
Speaker 1:  smart things on a phone, but it doesn't run an app store, it doesn't give

62
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:32,575
Speaker 1:  you a web browser, it doesn't give you everything. It's like this sort of

63
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:36,455
Speaker 1:  minimum viable smartphone as a like either a nights

64
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:39,375
Speaker 1:  and weekend phone or like a thing for kids, which I know the light phone

65
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,695
Speaker 1:  has become very popular in. Or just like, I don't wanna spend so much time

66
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:46,415
Speaker 1:  looking at my phone, so I'm gonna buy a different phone. Do you buy this

67
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:47,455
Speaker 1:  premise at all? Oh,

68
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:47,735
Speaker 6:  Boy.

69
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:53,415
Speaker 6:  I, I want to, I want to believe in a minimalist

70
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:53,735
Speaker 6:  phone

71
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:54,775
Speaker 4:  For

72
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:59,525
Speaker 6:  Every time. I've kind of like gone two steps into

73
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:03,925
Speaker 6:  investigating it as an option. Like for me, because I don't want

74
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:08,205
Speaker 6:  10,000 notifications every day, I would like to exit

75
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:11,965
Speaker 6:  that existence. It just, it kind of falls

76
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:15,885
Speaker 6:  apart for me. Like, pretty quickly. I use the Barbie

77
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:19,605
Speaker 6:  phone for like a day and a half. Sure.

78
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:24,045
Speaker 6:  Like, had my phone number on it, and it

79
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:28,125
Speaker 6:  almost gave me a panic attack. Like trying to type text with T nine

80
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:32,645
Speaker 6:  is horrifying. Like, I know some people kind of think of the like, well,

81
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:35,645
Speaker 6:  you know, you put up some friction between you and

82
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:40,205
Speaker 6:  messaging, and maybe that's a way out of like constant communication

83
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:44,085
Speaker 6:  and stuff. For me, I hated it. And I, I look

84
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:47,605
Speaker 6:  at something like the light phone, like, especially that one, like, it's

85
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:50,885
Speaker 6:  a beautiful little device. I love the idea of like,

86
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:55,005
Speaker 6:  I'll just leave the apps behind and go into the world

87
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:59,125
Speaker 6:  unencumbered. But then I start thinking like, what if I need to

88
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,405
Speaker 6:  call an Uber and I get a panic attack again?

89
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:07,765
Speaker 1:  Okay. What a perfect unintentional segue to the game that I have devised

90
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:11,245
Speaker 1:  for us. So, no, I wrote down a list of, I think it's

91
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:15,005
Speaker 1:  35 things. Oh boy. And we are going to go through all

92
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:18,925
Speaker 1:  35 of these things, and we are going to decide, the gimmick here is you and

93
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:22,805
Speaker 1:  I are designing the perfect minimalist smartphone. Okay. That

94
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:26,605
Speaker 1:  does all the things it should do and nothing else. Right. And I, and we,

95
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:30,325
Speaker 1:  we have free rein. There are no rules. We're not worried about costs. The

96
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:34,325
Speaker 1:  question is just what should our phone do and not do? Okay.

97
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:37,165
Speaker 1:  And, and I'm just, we're gonna run through this list. Some of these I think

98
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,245
Speaker 1:  are really easy, some I think are really hard, and we're just gonna talk

99
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:42,485
Speaker 1:  through all of them. Yeah. Does it sound good? I love it. All right. I'm

100
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:45,925
Speaker 1:  just, it's, it's, I think it's 35 things, so we might be here a while. Okay.

101
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:50,485
Speaker 1:  Okay. These are in no particular order except the, the order

102
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:54,565
Speaker 1:  I thought of them first thing phone make phone calls. Yep. We're good at

103
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:57,365
Speaker 1:  this, right? We got, yeah. Okay. Easy one. Got it. Thing number two. Camera.

104
00:07:58,085 --> 00:07:58,965
Speaker 1:  Should this phone have a camera?

105
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,085
Speaker 6:  I think it should, yeah.

106
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:03,205
Speaker 1:  Should it be a good camera one

107
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:06,045
Speaker 6:  Camera? And it can be okay, I think.

108
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:10,125
Speaker 1:  Okay. Yeah. So we don't, we're not interested in, like, this is not the

109
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,685
Speaker 1:  camera. You like, spend your day taking pictures of your child. Yeah. This

110
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:16,885
Speaker 1:  is like a, it's a camera. If you like, need to take a picture of the poster

111
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:19,085
Speaker 1:  and remember it later. Yeah. That's what we're doing here.

112
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:22,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah. We'll be like, you can have a, a better camera separately.

113
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:26,565
Speaker 1:  Right? That's true. If you want a good camera, buy a good camera. Yeah. I

114
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:28,765
Speaker 1:  suppose as like part of the point of these phones.

115
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You can buy a camera.

116
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,725
Speaker 1:  All right. But we're, we're allowing one pretty good camera.

117
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:34,685
Speaker 6:  Yes. Yeah.

118
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:36,805
Speaker 1:  Okay. I'm cool with this calculator.

119
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,005
Speaker 6:  Mm. Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:42,645
Speaker 1:  I was really hoping you were gonna be like, no, too addictive. I'm not a

121
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:43,165
Speaker 1:  calculator.

122
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:47,125
Speaker 6:  No. Does it run Tetris? Like my TI

123
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,485
Speaker 6:  83 did? That's an important question.

124
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:53,885
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, do you remember all the games you could install in the TI 83?

125
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:55,765
Speaker 1:  Oh my God. Like a calculator's, a slippery slope. It

126
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,325
Speaker 6:  It is, it really is. It's a gateway

127
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:01,645
Speaker 1:  App. All right. But we're allowing a calculator. Yes.

128
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:05,725
Speaker 1:  Text messaging. Just like basic S-M-S-R-C-S text messaging.

129
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:06,565
Speaker 6:  Yes.

130
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:08,205
Speaker 1:  Okay. WhatsApp.

131
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:14,175
Speaker 6:  I like, I am just hearing Europe call

132
00:09:14,235 --> 00:09:18,015
Speaker 6:  out like, yeah, they need WhatsApp. I feel like you should be able to

133
00:09:18,215 --> 00:09:22,175
Speaker 6:  download a messaging app of your choice that feels

134
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,375
Speaker 6:  right.

135
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:23,855
Speaker 1:  All of them. One of them.

136
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:25,375
Speaker 6:  Oh my gosh. Well,

137
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,655
Speaker 1:  This is tricky, right? 'cause it's like, okay, if we're gonna allow you to

138
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:32,615
Speaker 1:  have WhatsApp, we should probably allow you to have Telegram. But then if

139
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:36,575
Speaker 1:  you have Telegram, we've just given you an entire social network and like

140
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:40,295
Speaker 1:  you can message in Instagram and that's gonna come up later. But I don't

141
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:42,815
Speaker 1:  think we wanna give people Instagram. Right? So it's like, this just gets

142
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,495
Speaker 1:  messy. But the reason I included WhatsApp is I think WhatsApp is, It is just

143
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:50,055
Speaker 1:  so thoroughly like the default messaging app for the world. Right. That we

144
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,175
Speaker 1:  kind of have to allow it,

145
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:55,415
Speaker 6:  It Okay. Yeah. I'll just have punt the question of other

146
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:57,775
Speaker 6:  apps. But WhatsApp we need, yeah.

147
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:01,455
Speaker 1:  I think I'm actually okay with no other messaging apps. Like, we're just

148
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:05,255
Speaker 1:  gonna let WhatsApp win the world. Yeah. Yeah. I don't feel great about it,

149
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:06,895
Speaker 1:  but it's, it's where we are. Okay.

150
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:07,615
Speaker 6:  I like it.

151
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:09,735
Speaker 1:  The next one is snapchat.

152
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:11,445
Speaker 6:  Hmm. Hmm.

153
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,565
Speaker 1:  I actually, I I will, I will foreshadow I struggled harder with Snapchat

154
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:17,445
Speaker 1:  than maybe any other one on this list. Really?

155
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:18,205
Speaker 6:  Oh.

156
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:22,365
Speaker 1:  'cause Snapchat to many people, including many young people who would really

157
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:25,125
Speaker 1:  benefit from a device like this one is their

158
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:28,845
Speaker 1:  communication system. It's like, it's, that's where they talk to all of their

159
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:32,645
Speaker 1:  friends. That's the, the like lifeline of their life. But then right next

160
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,605
Speaker 1:  to Snapchat, their Snapchat Discover, which has all the problems that we're

161
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:36,205
Speaker 1:  trying to avoid.

162
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:37,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's

163
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:37,805
Speaker 1:  Messy.

164
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:42,165
Speaker 6:  It feels too close to the thing we're trying to Yeah. Get away from, which

165
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,765
Speaker 6:  is just the scrolling machine. I vote no Snapchat,

166
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,885
Speaker 6:  but maybe that's because I'm old and I am cranky

167
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:50,685
Speaker 6:  about Snapchat.

168
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:54,365
Speaker 1:  Well, I do think we just immediately lost the entire teen market with this,

169
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:57,725
Speaker 1:  with this plan, which is, it's not gonna be good for business, but sorry

170
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:01,245
Speaker 1:  teams, but, okay. I think we're, we're good. We're out on Snapchat. Go to

171
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:04,445
Speaker 1:  WhatsApp. I guess. You're welcome. We're just giving you, you go everything.

172
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:06,845
Speaker 1:  A web browser.

173
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:10,765
Speaker 6:  Ooh. That's tricky. I can, God,

174
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:15,905
Speaker 6:  that's so hard. Like, can you imagine walking around

175
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:19,065
Speaker 6:  and you think of a question, you can't look up the answer.

176
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:22,725
Speaker 1:  But also if we give you a web browser,

177
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:27,085
Speaker 1:  you kind of have access to everything else. Everything. We just made it very

178
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:27,525
Speaker 1:  slightly harder.

179
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,685
Speaker 6:  It's Pandora's box. Yeah. Yeah. I like, personally,

180
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:35,845
Speaker 6:  I would be fine with the web browser as the answer to like, do you in an

181
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:39,805
Speaker 6:  emergency need to call an Uber? Here's a crappy web browser. Type in

182
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:43,045
Speaker 6:  your, your, you know, credentials.

183
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,365
Speaker 6:  Can I vote for a web browser? But it's like kind of janky.

184
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:53,045
Speaker 1:  Oh, that's like a, like an e-reader style. Yeah. Web browser where like,

185
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,125
Speaker 1:  like you can use it if you need to. Yeah. But it's gonna suck. And you're

186
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:56,765
Speaker 1:  not gonna want to,

187
00:11:57,245 --> 00:12:00,925
Speaker 6:  I did check emails on a, like first gen Kindle for

188
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:05,205
Speaker 6:  a while and it was the worst experience of my life. Yeah.

189
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:05,765
Speaker 6:  Okay.

190
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,525
Speaker 1:  All right. I'm good with that. I was, I was also thinking maybe we do a web

191
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:12,365
Speaker 1:  browser, but we only white list like 10 domains.

192
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:16,245
Speaker 1:  Oh. So it's like, you can, you can use Wikipedia. You can do,

193
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:20,645
Speaker 1:  I don't know, you can do Google searches, but you can't

194
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,365
Speaker 1:  like go to most websites.

195
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:23,925
Speaker 6:  Mm.

196
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:28,245
Speaker 1:  This is probably a bad idea. But that was, that was my compromise. I know.

197
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:28,645
Speaker 1:  Theory.

198
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,765
Speaker 6:  I feel like I would just rely on like, the AI search results from Google

199
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,765
Speaker 6:  a lot and then I wouldn't like click through to the source

200
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,765
Speaker 6:  material. And that could be problematic.

201
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,845
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That's a dangerous game to force

202
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,645
Speaker 6:  On people. Yeah. I vote for full web browser, but it kind of sucks. So you

203
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:45,365
Speaker 6:  don't wanna use it

204
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:49,725
Speaker 1:  Like a, like a 2005 era web browser Yeah. Is what we're

205
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:53,285
Speaker 1:  offering you. Yeah. Alright. I'm good with that. It like, won't run any of

206
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:56,885
Speaker 1:  the web apps you want to do, but it will like show you text

207
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,885
Speaker 1:  on webpage, which is what we're after. Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'm good with that.

208
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:03,245
Speaker 1:  We're gonna call it Netscape Navigator. It's gonna be nuts. We

209
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:03,805
Speaker 6:  Love it.

210
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:09,085
Speaker 1:  Next one list is Spotify slash whatever music app you wanna pick.

211
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:13,565
Speaker 6:  Ooh. This is where the minimalist phones fall apart for me. 'cause

212
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,725
Speaker 6:  I'm like, I don't have physical media anymore.

213
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:21,885
Speaker 6:  Bless all of you. Who do? And you held onto that. That's incredible. I just

214
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:26,445
Speaker 6:  turned my soul over to Spotify, so I'm like, a phone that doesn't have Spotify

215
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:30,405
Speaker 6:  doesn't work for me. Really? So for me personally, I

216
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:34,365
Speaker 6:  vote yes for Spotify, but I don't know if that, does it

217
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:38,085
Speaker 6:  violate the, the minimalist phone ethos once you invite

218
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:38,805
Speaker 6:  Spotify in?

219
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:41,965
Speaker 1:  I don't think it does, honestly. This one's actually fairly easy for me,

220
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:45,805
Speaker 1:  for the same exact reason. Like Spotify music and

221
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:49,525
Speaker 1:  podcasts are probably the things I do most often. Like measured

222
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,485
Speaker 1:  by time on my phone. And there's a

223
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:56,765
Speaker 1:  thing, like in talking to the, the light phone folks, they've been thinking

224
00:13:56,765 --> 00:14:00,525
Speaker 1:  like, okay, is there a way we can take, you know, part of the Spotify

225
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:04,165
Speaker 1:  experience and like, what if you could just sync a playlist and there was

226
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:06,525
Speaker 1:  like that mighty device that was the same kind of thing that it would keep

227
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:09,925
Speaker 1:  one of your playlists in sync. So I think there might be something Yeah.

228
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:13,125
Speaker 1:  There, like give me very simple

229
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:17,805
Speaker 1:  sort of old school iPod level access Yeah. To my Spotify library. But nothing

230
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:18,565
Speaker 1:  else like

231
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:22,005
Speaker 6:  A widget. Like just gimme a widget. Yeah. Where it kind of

232
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:26,125
Speaker 6:  sucks, like searching around for stuff, but you can find it.

233
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:30,445
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But I agree. I think if you want a phone like this to

234
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:32,965
Speaker 1:  actually work for people, it's gotta have a music app.

235
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:36,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of the WhatsApp of music apps.

236
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,325
Speaker 1:  I had a really funny experience with the light phone three 'cause they have

237
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:44,165
Speaker 1:  a music app, but you have to upload MP threes and

238
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:47,125
Speaker 1:  like you, I just don't have a local music collection anymore. Yeah. So I

239
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,965
Speaker 1:  literally was like digging around on my computer to find any MP three

240
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:53,885
Speaker 1:  file. Yeah. I could to upload to this thing just so I could test it out.

241
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:57,445
Speaker 1:  And I was like, my God, IIII have a hard drive full of

242
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:01,405
Speaker 1:  local music somewhere in this house. And I, for the life of me couldn't tell

243
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:02,485
Speaker 1:  you where It is or what's on it.

244
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:06,685
Speaker 6:  No. Did you have that U2 album that Apple

245
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:07,885
Speaker 6:  put on everyone's phone?

246
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,965
Speaker 1:  That, that lives on a phone that I will never touch again and refuse

247
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:12,525
Speaker 1:  to acknowledge.

248
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:13,965
Speaker 6:  Okay. That's fair.

249
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:17,845
Speaker 1:  Maybe that's what we do here. It is. Just once a month our minimalist phone

250
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,045
Speaker 1:  just gives you an album. Yeah. That's what, and you have listen that album

251
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:21,485
Speaker 1:  for the next,

252
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:22,845
Speaker 6:  You better like it.

253
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:27,165
Speaker 1:  Exactly. All right, next on my list is email. This one seems

254
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:27,685
Speaker 1:  easy.

255
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:31,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. You need, I need email.

256
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,885
Speaker 1:  Oh, interesting. I think it's easy. The other way really, I think if we're

257
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:37,525
Speaker 1:  trying to do a minimalist smartphone, the very first thing we should take

258
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:40,245
Speaker 1:  away from people is the hell of their email app. Oh

259
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:43,245
Speaker 6:  God. Yeah. I guess people who don't live

260
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:47,085
Speaker 6:  so online probably,

261
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:51,285
Speaker 1:  And let's be honest, we could both stand to be a little less online that

262
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,645
Speaker 6:  It would probably be Okay, this

263
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:54,605
Speaker 1:  Is what we're trying to do here.

264
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:56,925
Speaker 6:  I'm trying to think of an email that would like,

265
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:02,325
Speaker 6:  I would cause real problems for me if I didn't check it in real

266
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:02,645
Speaker 6:  time.

267
00:16:04,515 --> 00:16:08,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I, okay. I vote no email. Email sucks. I

268
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:08,765
Speaker 6:  hate it.

269
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:12,885
Speaker 1:  I I do think the, the the thing you just did in your brain is

270
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:16,525
Speaker 1:  what I do with every one of these. Yeah. Where like, I'm like, oh my God,

271
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:20,325
Speaker 1:  what if something horrible happens and I have to know about it? Yeah. And

272
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:23,805
Speaker 1:  it's like, oh, that's almost certainly never gonna happen. And phone

273
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,445
Speaker 1:  calls exist. Right?

274
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:26,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think,

275
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:30,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah, a useful societal thing is like, if, if something urgent is happening,

276
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,885
Speaker 1:  call me on the phone. Yeah. I'm good with that.

277
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:36,805
Speaker 6:  There was a time before email and no, nobody

278
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:40,365
Speaker 6:  died. Like from lack of email. Yeah.

279
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:43,645
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. I agree with that. All right, good. So no email, we're out on

280
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:47,205
Speaker 1:  email. Some kind of note taking app.

281
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,045
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. We

282
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,525
Speaker 1:  Need that. Either one that we make or your favorite. Yeah.

283
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:54,245
Speaker 6:  And that could be fun 'cause you know, it's not

284
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,085
Speaker 6:  distracting to take notes.

285
00:16:56,835 --> 00:17:00,645
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I agree. Okay. Are we, are we like, are we building our own

286
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:04,605
Speaker 1:  like minimalist one or are we just like, listen up losers,

287
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:06,405
Speaker 1:  here's notion on our minimalist

288
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:10,285
Speaker 6:  Phone. Oh my gosh. A notion Phone is the whole thing. I'm

289
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:11,725
Speaker 6:  gonna have to contemplate Now.

290
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:14,565
Speaker 1:  People would, people would buy a notion phone. I'm, I would buy a

291
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,165
Speaker 6:  Notion phone. Okay. That's another podcast.

292
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:23,205
Speaker 6:  I think, you know, it could be basic. It could just be like text,

293
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:27,655
Speaker 6:  put the text in. Save it for later. Move on with your life.

294
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:27,895
Speaker 6:  Okay.

295
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:31,375
Speaker 1:  I, the only one I'll add to that is I also want voice notes. Yeah. So just

296
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:35,015
Speaker 1:  basic typing. Yeah. Let me, let me talk to my notes. Nothing else. We'll

297
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:37,815
Speaker 1:  worry about the rest of it when I get back to my computer. Right. But yeah,

298
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:41,335
Speaker 1:  I agree. You gotta have something, a re a dedicated

299
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:45,295
Speaker 1:  reading app, whether it's like a Kindle or like Pocket or whatever.

300
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:48,895
Speaker 1:  Just some place I have to read stuff. Should I be reading things on this,

301
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,400
Speaker 1:  this device?

302
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:53,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I would like that. 'cause then if you, if this is kind of like a secondary

303
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,365
Speaker 6:  device, you could kind of sync that up and then it's there for you.

304
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:01,135
Speaker 6:  Is this, have we just invented the BS Palmer?

305
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:05,295
Speaker 1:  I mean, a little, but the, I, I'm actually, I struggled with this one more

306
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:06,815
Speaker 1:  than I expected to because on the one hand

307
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:12,615
Speaker 1:  I, I read a ton on my phone and that's like a thing I'd like to do. That

308
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:15,655
Speaker 1:  I think is mostly an additive activity. And I think that's fine. On the other

309
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:19,535
Speaker 1:  hand, part of what we're trying to do with this whole genre of phones

310
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:22,895
Speaker 1:  is get people looking at their screens less. Yeah. So I'm like, is the answer

311
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:27,615
Speaker 1:  go by physical books? 'cause I don't, I don't love that. But

312
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,535
Speaker 1:  I don't know, I'm so torn. Like, it's such a screen time debate

313
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:34,255
Speaker 1:  here. Right? Like, is our goal to get you to use your screen time better?

314
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:36,375
Speaker 1:  Or is our goal to get you to not look at your screen?

315
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:40,335
Speaker 6:  What if you can only sync up like, like

316
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:44,815
Speaker 6:  nutritious, meaty articles. Like you can't

317
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:48,815
Speaker 6:  be reading any crap on your phone or a book.

318
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:49,415
Speaker 6:  I don't

319
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:53,215
Speaker 1:  Know. That's, that's fun. I think we maybe do, it's a reading app, but

320
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,615
Speaker 1:  it's only books. And if you wanna read trashy books, that is up to you. But

321
00:18:56,655 --> 00:19:00,055
Speaker 1:  I think like, I, I like the idea that we are going to like heavily incentivize

322
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:01,415
Speaker 1:  book reading. Yeah,

323
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:05,335
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Read books on your minimalist phone. I, I'm into it. Yeah.

324
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:08,255
Speaker 1:  Right. Okay. But it will not be the Kindle app because the Kindle app sucks

325
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,655
Speaker 1:  and we will not put it on our phone. Yeah. Okay. I have four games for you

326
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:15,015
Speaker 1:  in a row and we are gonna litigate each one. Are you ready? Okay.

327
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:18,775
Speaker 1:  The first one is the New York Times Games app. So crossword. Absolutely.

328
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,015
Speaker 6:  Okay. I was just playing it

329
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:26,095
Speaker 6:  before we got on here, so Yeah. Gotta

330
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,335
Speaker 1:  Have it. Okay. Sold. I'm in too. Candy Crush?

331
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:30,295
Speaker 6:  No, no Candy Crush.

332
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,175
Speaker 1:  Why not?

333
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:35,975
Speaker 6:  I don't know. It feels wrong. It feels like the, can you

334
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:39,695
Speaker 6:  read a book versus can you just read any old thing on

335
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:40,375
Speaker 6:  the internet?

336
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,375
Speaker 6:  I don't wanna tell people what to do with their lives. This

337
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,135
Speaker 1:  Is the thing. Oh my gosh, I'm so glad you said that. I've gone back and forth

338
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:49,815
Speaker 1:  on this a thousand times because on the one hand I'm like, what I'm doing

339
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,015
Speaker 1:  is basically moralizing for you in the form of a smartphone.

340
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:53,455
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

341
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,535
Speaker 1:  But then on the other hand, that is a little bit the job. Yeah.

342
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:58,015
Speaker 6:  Like,

343
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:02,455
Speaker 1:  I think part of third of the existence of these devices is Yeah. People like

344
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:06,295
Speaker 1:  you and me being like, I I am helpless in front of my

345
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:09,375
Speaker 1:  phone. Right. And I think, I think many of us are in like very real

346
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:13,415
Speaker 1:  scientifically provable ways. We are losing the battle to our

347
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:16,975
Speaker 1:  phones. And if, if somebody on the other side can like,

348
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:21,015
Speaker 1:  have my interest in mind in a realer way, maybe that's okay.

349
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:23,935
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And so maybe our job is to tell people how to spend their time a little

350
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,295
Speaker 1:  bit here.

351
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:28,055
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You're kind of buying into like an ethos almost.

352
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:31,735
Speaker 6:  Or like, that's kind of the vibe I think. Like, you go to the light phone

353
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:35,335
Speaker 6:  website and it, it's all almost like, you know, the

354
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:39,415
Speaker 6:  humane shtick without, you know, lasers and AI

355
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:43,775
Speaker 6:  where it's sort, it's sort of beautiful and simple. You're like, I would

356
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:47,485
Speaker 6:  like that in the things that go along with it. Which maybe means I can't

357
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:51,205
Speaker 6:  play Candy Crush, but I can play Wordle. Yeah.

358
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:54,805
Speaker 1:  And I'm, I'm good with that. I do feel like I cannot prove this, but I feel

359
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:58,685
Speaker 1:  like Wordle is better for your soul and mind than Candy Crush.

360
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:00,285
Speaker 6:  I think so. I think so.

361
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:04,085
Speaker 1:  If, if anyone has done a study on that, please let me know. I would very

362
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:07,645
Speaker 1:  much like to hear it. Okay. Two more games. And I suspect

363
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:10,405
Speaker 1:  I will know the answer to both of these based on what you just said about

364
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:14,365
Speaker 1:  Candy Crush. TRO is next. Just because I love TRO and I wanna play

365
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,005
Speaker 1:  it all the time. Oh, but I don't think we should put it

366
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:19,645
Speaker 6:  On here. I say no. Okay. Having never played it for a second, I say no.

367
00:21:20,705 --> 00:21:24,525
Speaker 1:  You both should because it's awesome and shouldn't because it will ruin

368
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:28,445
Speaker 1:  your life. It is, yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm not exaggerating. It

369
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:32,405
Speaker 1:  is the only thing I have ever done straight from the minute I sat down

370
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:36,325
Speaker 1:  on a plane to the minute I got off of the plane. Oh, wow. Just one.

371
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:39,405
Speaker 1:  It was like a four hour flight and I did it every single second of the flight

372
00:21:39,405 --> 00:21:42,405
Speaker 1:  without putting my phone down. And literally we landed and I was like, well,

373
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:45,965
Speaker 1:  we're here already. And it was a real moment of like, oh, I can't play this

374
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:46,405
Speaker 1:  game anymore.

375
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:50,205
Speaker 6:  Okay. It is not, not, I'll save it for a flight. I'll try it out when I need

376
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:51,125
Speaker 6:  to fly cross country.

377
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:55,085
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Sometime when you're like, I can't do anything for eight hours anyway.

378
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:59,125
Speaker 1:  Just play Bellara. Okay. And the last one is Fortnite, which I think is

379
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:01,805
Speaker 1:  Yeah. An obvious no for the same reasons.

380
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:02,845
Speaker 6:  Can't have it. Yeah.

381
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:06,735
Speaker 1:  Okay. Alright. Good. Moving on. A Maps app,

382
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:09,495
Speaker 1:  Google Maps, apple Maps, whichever one you want it to be. That feels like

383
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,095
Speaker 1:  we need that, right?

384
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,615
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I would need navigation for sure.

385
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:18,055
Speaker 1:  All right. Good. Easy calendar. This one's a little email ish to me.

386
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:19,895
Speaker 1:  Right? I see pros and cons.

387
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:24,055
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Well, I do wanna know what day It is. So I vote for

388
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:28,615
Speaker 6:  a calendar that tells you what day It is. Should it

389
00:22:28,685 --> 00:22:32,615
Speaker 6:  sync up to my work calendar is what

390
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,255
Speaker 6:  I would not want.

391
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:39,695
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Maybe it's just like a, it's like a

392
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:43,855
Speaker 6:  paper calendar, but in app form where you

393
00:22:43,855 --> 00:22:46,735
Speaker 6:  can like, oh, I like that. Maybe you add stuff to it.

394
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:51,375
Speaker 6:  But it does, it, it's just there, it just sits there. It doesn't just like

395
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,615
Speaker 6:  writing on a paper calendar,

396
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:56,375
Speaker 1:  You can't do anything with it. Yeah. It's just, it's just a calendar.

397
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,895
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There was this thing we were chatting about for a minute

398
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:05,055
Speaker 6:  on Slack that was like, some company mate is called like paper

399
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:06,575
Speaker 6:  apps and it's like,

400
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:07,175
Speaker 1:  Oh yeah.

401
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:11,415
Speaker 6:  Everything has come back full circle where it, it's so cute. It's like they

402
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:15,335
Speaker 6:  have a golf game or something that you play, like you get the

403
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:19,335
Speaker 6:  little notebook and, but I'm like, oh, a notepad is

404
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:23,375
Speaker 6:  a paper app because that's, that's like how

405
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:27,175
Speaker 6:  it worked anyway. It gets so dumb so fast. But

406
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:29,735
Speaker 6:  it's cute. I like it. Yeah.

407
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,775
Speaker 1:  I'm into it. My pitch for this would be that we find some clever way to

408
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:37,575
Speaker 1:  combine it with the note taking app so that you can like, add

409
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:41,415
Speaker 1:  stuff to your calendar and know that it will go to your calendar, but

410
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:43,575
Speaker 1:  you can't actually look at your calendar.

411
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:44,975
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:48,805
Speaker 1:  Or at least you can't like, interact with your calendar in some way. Right.

413
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:51,925
Speaker 1:  Right. Because I think there's something to, like, knowing your next appointment

414
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:55,885
Speaker 1:  is fine, but I don't wanna be able to like open up and move

415
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:58,765
Speaker 1:  things around in my calendar on this device that feels, that feels wrong

416
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:00,005
Speaker 1:  for what we're trying to do here. Yeah.

417
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,445
Speaker 6:  Like read only.

418
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:06,085
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And like pretty, and not Yeah. Gross.

419
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:08,525
Speaker 1:  Nice. And like maybe only shows me two events at a time.

420
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:11,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. You may only know two things at a time.

421
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:12,005
Speaker 1:  Exactly.

422
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:17,565
Speaker 1:  Okay. Next up some kind of video chat service,

423
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:21,965
Speaker 1:  FaceTime, zoom, meet all of them or one of them, whatever you want. But

424
00:24:22,165 --> 00:24:23,165
Speaker 1:  something for video chat.

425
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:27,525
Speaker 6:  I vote No. Really? I think, yeah, I think you have to

426
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:32,405
Speaker 6:  talk on the phone or go to your computer.

427
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:37,195
Speaker 1:  Okay. My, my worry for this strategy would be, it's

428
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:41,755
Speaker 1:  possible that video chat has like crossed the line

429
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:46,115
Speaker 1:  into it's as important. Like, it might be as important as phone calls

430
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:46,835
Speaker 1:  and text messages.

431
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:47,835
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah.

432
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:50,475
Speaker 1:  I don't feel like it's all the way there, but It is. It is. It feels like

433
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:53,235
Speaker 1:  it's getting closer and closer every day. And so my worry is if we don't

434
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:55,115
Speaker 1:  allow this, there's just a bunch of people who are like, well then of course

435
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:58,035
Speaker 1:  I'm never buying this. Yeah. In the same way that if we don't have WhatsApp,

436
00:24:58,485 --> 00:25:01,435
Speaker 1:  we've just instantly ruled out lots of people for whom this doesn't work

437
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:03,395
Speaker 1:  anymore. I don't know about video chat

438
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:07,355
Speaker 6:  Though. I know the other side of the coin is when you're like, I

439
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:10,955
Speaker 6:  can't, sorry, I can't video chat you, we can call on the phone.

440
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:15,395
Speaker 6:  That's kind of a relief. You're like, yeah, you get a little

441
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:19,515
Speaker 6:  vacation from like doing Zooms or Google meets or

442
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:22,835
Speaker 6:  whatever. So maybe it's a a little bit of like a

443
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:27,115
Speaker 6:  you're choosing this and it's

444
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:28,995
Speaker 6:  healthier for you. Question mark.

445
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,915
Speaker 1:  No, I I actually, I totally agree with that. You've, you've just swayed me.

446
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:35,715
Speaker 1:  'cause I think a again, we're talking about a phone you're not supposed to

447
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:39,555
Speaker 1:  stare at all day. Yeah. And b we do all

448
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:43,075
Speaker 1:  spend too much time looking at our own faces. Yeah. It's like not healthy.

449
00:25:43,285 --> 00:25:46,435
Speaker 6:  We're all secretly like looking for a break from that.

450
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:47,475
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

451
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:50,955
Speaker 1:  Yeah. All right. I'm in no video chat, but maybe, maybe it has a thing where

452
00:25:50,955 --> 00:25:53,995
Speaker 1:  people can, like, you can click on a Zoom link, but it'll just add you as

453
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:55,315
Speaker 1:  audio only. Yeah.

454
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:55,595
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

455
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:58,875
Speaker 1:  I'm trying to, like, the big question with all of these is like, how do you

456
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:02,675
Speaker 1:  integrate with all the stuff people actually need to use, but in a less

457
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:05,995
Speaker 1:  gross way? Yeah. And I kind of like the idea of like, it has all the video

458
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:07,875
Speaker 1:  chat apps, but audio only.

459
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,915
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. I like that. That

460
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:13,115
Speaker 1:  Would work for me. Okay. I also, can I just tell you, this is just a random

461
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:16,555
Speaker 1:  thing. The this light phone beautiful little lovely device.

462
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:18,595
Speaker 1:  It's very sharp up here.

463
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:18,875
Speaker 6:  Oh

464
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,155
Speaker 1:  No. It's when I hold it against my face to make phone calls, it like kind

465
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:25,075
Speaker 1:  of hurts my ears after a while. I really like this phone, but I don't

466
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:26,915
Speaker 1:  love really long phone calls on it.

467
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:28,475
Speaker 6:  It hurts as a phone. Yes.

468
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:32,435
Speaker 1:  Not, not exactly what you're going for anyway. All right. We got a bunch

469
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:35,955
Speaker 1:  more. Let's keep going. A few of these I think are gonna be easy. So this

470
00:26:35,955 --> 00:26:39,555
Speaker 1:  will be fun. A built-in AI chatbot of some kind.

471
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:42,915
Speaker 1:  Chatt, Claude Gemini. Pick your favorite. This goes back, I think to the

472
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:45,565
Speaker 1:  same thing as web browsers, which is like, what do you do if you have a question?

473
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:49,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, I vote. No, I vote you

474
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:54,645
Speaker 6:  if you need your clot or whatever, put it in the web browser and go talk

475
00:26:54,645 --> 00:26:55,085
Speaker 6:  to it there.

476
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:59,565
Speaker 1:  Okay. I I, I agree with you, but I just wanna play devil's advocate for one

477
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:03,525
Speaker 1:  second because I think there is a case to be made that

478
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:07,445
Speaker 1:  you could ditch half the other apps we've allowed and replace

479
00:27:07,445 --> 00:27:11,205
Speaker 1:  them all with a pretty good chat bot. Like something that can,

480
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:14,565
Speaker 1:  can remember things for me that can take notes down for me, that can find

481
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:18,205
Speaker 1:  information for me is actually in a certain way, like what

482
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:19,765
Speaker 1:  we're going for here.

483
00:27:20,435 --> 00:27:24,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's like we're, we've just like invented the whole premise of

484
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:28,605
Speaker 6:  AI on phones. Exactly. Where it's like, yeah. Ab abstract

485
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:32,285
Speaker 6:  all that away. The chat bot will just take care of it for you. But

486
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:36,645
Speaker 6:  the, the reality right now is you ask it to do a math equation instead of

487
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:40,285
Speaker 6:  having a calculator. Right. Rolling the dice. Whether that is

488
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:40,445
Speaker 1:  True,

489
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:42,245
Speaker 6:  You're gonna get the right answer or not.

490
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:45,525
Speaker 1:  That is true. Maybe when we do this exercise in like four or five years,

491
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:48,765
Speaker 1:  it'll be really different. Yeah. But right now the idea of replacing my calculator

492
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:52,605
Speaker 1:  app with Claude seems terrifying. Yeah,

493
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:53,045
Speaker 6:  I know.

494
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:56,965
Speaker 1:  But I do think you're right. Like spiritually they're a perfect fit. This

495
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:59,725
Speaker 1:  idea of, of like, now I have a device that I don't have to look at all day.

496
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:03,405
Speaker 1:  And so it can actually like be redesigned around the fact that I don't have

497
00:28:03,405 --> 00:28:05,925
Speaker 1:  to look at all that at all day and I can just talk to it and it does things

498
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:08,125
Speaker 1:  for me. Sounds awesome. Super duper doesn't work.

499
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:11,965
Speaker 6:  So somewhere the founders of Humane are just screaming

500
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:15,565
Speaker 6:  to void. They're like, you wanted this.

501
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:18,325
Speaker 1:  They're like, if it had worked, we'd still be here.

502
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:19,245
Speaker 6:  I know.

503
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:24,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. Didn't work. Nope. All right. So we're not allowing that.

504
00:28:25,065 --> 00:28:27,445
Speaker 1:  TikTok, I assume is just a No, we're out on TikTok.

505
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:29,365
Speaker 6:  No TikTok. No. Can't have it.

506
00:28:29,395 --> 00:28:31,685
Speaker 1:  Okay. Cap cut for making videos?

507
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:35,645
Speaker 6:  Mm. No, I vote No, but I think like

508
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,015
Speaker 6:  maybe some kind of system where if you record a video with your

509
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:43,975
Speaker 6:  minimalist phone, it can go somewhere. So you could

510
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:47,255
Speaker 6:  make it, but I don't know, as soon as you have that knowledge of like, oh,

511
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:50,935
Speaker 6:  I should record this. It could be a TikTok. It changes your whole,

512
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:54,575
Speaker 6:  like mo when you're out and about. 'cause I'm

513
00:28:54,575 --> 00:28:58,375
Speaker 6:  constantly like, I should take a picture of that. It'd be funny on Instagram

514
00:28:58,515 --> 00:29:02,415
Speaker 6:  or whatever. Totally. And maybe we wanna get away with that away from it.

515
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,115
Speaker 6:  I vote no.

516
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,395
Speaker 1:  Okay. I think I'm out too. And I think there's definitely a,

517
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:13,485
Speaker 1:  a sort of line in the sand here somewhere where it's like, if this activity

518
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:17,445
Speaker 1:  on your phone is gonna take you longer than X amount of time, it's

519
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:21,045
Speaker 1:  a, it's a computer task. Yeah. Or an iPad task or like when you get home

520
00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:24,605
Speaker 1:  task or whatever. And I think that is like, that's one of the things the

521
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:28,165
Speaker 1:  light folks have really tried to figure out is like, how long can we make

522
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:31,005
Speaker 1:  you use this device before? Actually we're just defeating the whole purpose.

523
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:34,805
Speaker 1:  And the answer is, go use the device that you bought to do things with. Right.

524
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:35,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

525
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:38,525
Speaker 1:  And I think there's, there's something, there's something in there. And I

526
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:40,965
Speaker 1:  think cap cut. You're probably right. Like if you wanna spend an hour editing

527
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,285
Speaker 1:  a video, you shouldn't do that on our minimalist phone.

528
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah, exactly. You

529
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:47,405
Speaker 1:  Should do it on an iPhone. iPhones will continue to exist until our company

530
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:50,245
Speaker 1:  takes over the world. Great. Of minimalist smartphones. Yeah. It's gonna

531
00:29:50,245 --> 00:29:53,365
Speaker 1:  be great. Alright, I have a few more then. Then I'm gonna let you out of

532
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:56,405
Speaker 1:  this horrible exercise. Okay. Instagram I think is a, no, we Right. We're

533
00:29:56,405 --> 00:30:00,325
Speaker 1:  out on Instagram. Instagram. The messaging thing is a little tough, but we'll

534
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:02,685
Speaker 1:  live. Yeah. Look, look at your memes somewhere else.

535
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:04,485
Speaker 1:  Duolingo.

536
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:08,825
Speaker 6:  Oh man. I do need my Duolingo.

537
00:30:09,785 --> 00:30:13,025
Speaker 1:  Duolingo is both like incredibly problematic because it's all about streaks

538
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:15,825
Speaker 1:  and it pests you all the time. And It is like designed to be addictive, but

539
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:17,985
Speaker 1:  It is also in a certain way. Like, good for you.

540
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:22,345
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Oh man, that's a tough one. It's

541
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:25,305
Speaker 6:  another, yeah, because like

542
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,185
Speaker 6:  feasibly, I could go through a whole day with this phone. Like, it feels

543
00:30:29,185 --> 00:30:32,345
Speaker 6:  like a phone I should be able to go through a whole day with. And if I

544
00:30:33,215 --> 00:30:36,585
Speaker 6:  have to use a streak freeze because I was using my

545
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:38,265
Speaker 6:  minimalist and I'll be pissed.

546
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:43,505
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I feel like there should be some access to Duolingo, but maybe

547
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:45,385
Speaker 6:  it can't bother me.

548
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:49,505
Speaker 1:  Oh, that's a, okay. That's a good one. Duolingo. But no, well, I think this

549
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:51,865
Speaker 1:  phone in general does not allow push notifications. Yeah.

550
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:52,345
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

551
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:56,145
Speaker 1:  Except no, no push notifications. It can alert you when someone is calling

552
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,185
Speaker 1:  you on the phone. And I think that's the only notification allowed.

553
00:30:58,445 --> 00:30:59,265
Speaker 6:  Yes. Agreed.

554
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:03,745
Speaker 1:  Okay. Yeah. Duolingo I think might actually be like the

555
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:07,025
Speaker 1:  perfect summation of why this is such a hard problem to solve because It

556
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:10,865
Speaker 1:  is both like, It is so problematic in so many ways. But

557
00:31:10,865 --> 00:31:14,465
Speaker 1:  like you just said, It is, it's, It is like a core part of many

558
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:18,305
Speaker 1:  people's day-to-day lives. Yeah. And not having it becomes a total non-starter.

559
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:22,425
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Which again, a kudos to Duolingo for pulling that off with a language

560
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:26,345
Speaker 1:  learning app. Good god. But It is, It is a strange thing. Yeah.

561
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:29,065
Speaker 1:  Alright. YouTube, I think we're, we're definitely not allowing YouTube.

562
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:30,065
Speaker 6:  No. YouTube.

563
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:34,065
Speaker 1:  I think we just don't want you watching videos on this phone. Like, I think

564
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:35,065
Speaker 1:  that's fine. Yeah.

565
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:35,825
Speaker 6:  Read an article

566
00:31:37,365 --> 00:31:38,745
Speaker 1:  Or just like, don't look at your phone.

567
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:39,785
Speaker 6:  Right.

568
00:31:40,325 --> 00:31:41,065
Speaker 1:  That's fine too.

569
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:45,305
Speaker 6:  I am envisioning myself, like I'm trying to fix something in my house on

570
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:48,305
Speaker 6:  my own, which is a bad idea to start with. Oh, interesting. But then I'm

571
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:52,225
Speaker 6:  like, I need to find the YouTube video of however you do this. But

572
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:56,105
Speaker 6:  if I'm in my house, I can go on a computer. I'm not like out

573
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:59,545
Speaker 6:  in the world trying to fix, like put up a shelf on someone's wall.

574
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:03,385
Speaker 1:  Well, we're also allowing the terrible web browser so it'll play. Yeah. Yeah.

575
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:07,505
Speaker 1:  It'll play the YouTube video. It'll look bad. Yes. And maybe it only plays

576
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,905
Speaker 1:  at like eight frames per second. But it

577
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:10,505
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

578
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:15,065
Speaker 1:  In a pinch it works. So I think, I think that as a workaround I don't love,

579
00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:15,905
Speaker 1:  but I can live with.

580
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,185
Speaker 6:  Okay. Yeah. Me too.

581
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,785
Speaker 1:  But I definitely don't think we have a YouTube app that's No. That violates

582
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:23,865
Speaker 1:  all of our rules. Yeah. Okay. And I think Netflix, same thing. No Netflix.

583
00:32:24,245 --> 00:32:26,545
Speaker 1:  No Netflix. You have plenty of other places to watch Netflix. Don't do it

584
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,305
Speaker 1:  on your phone. Yeah.

585
00:32:27,305 --> 00:32:28,145
Speaker 6:  Watch a tv.

586
00:32:28,795 --> 00:32:32,745
Speaker 1:  Right. Some kind of file storage app, Dropbox, Google Drive.

587
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:33,505
Speaker 1:  Pick your favorite.

588
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:38,725
Speaker 6:  Oh man. I'm just thinking about how annoying the iPhone

589
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:42,445
Speaker 6:  is to deal with as soon as you need to get a file off of it. It's true. And

590
00:32:42,445 --> 00:32:46,165
Speaker 6:  it feels like we fought so hard just to have a files app on the

591
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:50,045
Speaker 6:  iPhone. I don't wanna not have it, but maybe you

592
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:52,805
Speaker 6:  can like sync stuff to Google Drive if you have to.

593
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:54,805
Speaker 6:  Does that make sense?

594
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:59,045
Speaker 1:  Okay. So you can't like access your Google Drive, but you can send something

595
00:32:59,045 --> 00:32:59,685
Speaker 1:  to Google Drive.

596
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:00,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

597
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,685
Speaker 1:  I'm good with that. We can, we can do that with the API like a Okay. Yeah.

598
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:07,845
Speaker 1:  Like a, it's you, you hit a backup button and it goes straight to Google

599
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:11,645
Speaker 1:  Drive, but you can't see all the files in your Google Drive. Yeah. All right.

600
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:12,925
Speaker 1:  I'm good with that. I can work with that.

601
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,125
Speaker 1:  Uber slash Lyft,

602
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:21,225
Speaker 6:  It could be the web browser thing, but

603
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:25,785
Speaker 1:  I actually think you need something with like real phone level

604
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,985
Speaker 1:  access. Yeah. That's like an app that is always on that can

605
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:33,785
Speaker 1:  do the, you know, really fine location stuff. This is one of those that

606
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:37,585
Speaker 1:  I'm like, I, I don't actually use Uber and Lyft all that

607
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:41,025
Speaker 1:  often in my day to day, but the idea of not having it as an option

608
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:44,345
Speaker 1:  feels like a problem. Yeah. So I think, I think I would need it.

609
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:48,825
Speaker 6:  I would too. Yeah. It's like a, a lifeline where I'm like,

610
00:33:49,135 --> 00:33:52,585
Speaker 6:  well if everything goes south here calling Uber.

611
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:56,585
Speaker 1:  Right. And It is, It is a tool you expect to have available to you. And they

612
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:59,545
Speaker 1:  have a bunch of weird workarounds. Like I think you can call on the phone

613
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:03,465
Speaker 1:  and get an Uber. Oh, that's cute. And they have some of the like chat bot

614
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:05,985
Speaker 1:  integration stuff. But I think, I think we need the Uber app. I'm okay with

615
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:09,185
Speaker 1:  that. Yeah. And that's also not really an app you like hang out in anyway.

616
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:11,625
Speaker 1:  No. So I'm not, I'm not super bothered by it. If they

617
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:14,895
Speaker 6:  Like gamify the Uber app, I'll be so annoyed.

618
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:18,615
Speaker 1:  You know, they want, you know, they wanna Yeah. Somebody in there is like,

619
00:34:18,675 --> 00:34:20,695
Speaker 1:  how do we Duolingo the Uber

620
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:23,735
Speaker 6:  App? Oh, I had to use a streak phrase on my Uber app.

621
00:34:24,915 --> 00:34:26,575
Speaker 6:  God. Yeah. It's nightmare.

622
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:29,975
Speaker 1:  Dara, if you're listening, that's not a good idea. Don't do that. Please

623
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:30,615
Speaker 6:  Don't do it.

624
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:32,815
Speaker 1:  All right. I got two more

625
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:38,455
Speaker 1:  Slack slash Teams. Feels like if we're not allowing email, we cannot

626
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:39,255
Speaker 1:  allow Slack and Teams.

627
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:42,015
Speaker 6:  No. Get outta here. Slack and teams. Okay.

628
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,345
Speaker 1:  Okay, good. I'm, I'm glad we're on the same team. Last one.

629
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:50,265
Speaker 1:  Venmo slash cash app slash some way to send money. Does this

630
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:51,065
Speaker 1:  matter? Do we need this?

631
00:34:51,605 --> 00:34:55,305
Speaker 6:  Can you can web browser that right? I'm trying to think of like, you can,

632
00:34:56,185 --> 00:35:00,105
Speaker 6:  I went to a thing this weekend where we like

633
00:35:00,575 --> 00:35:04,385
Speaker 6:  painted these little figurines. It was like called Art club and we

634
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:08,265
Speaker 6:  paid through Venmo. I'm like, I'd wanna be able to do that.

635
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:12,105
Speaker 6:  But Yeah, you have the camera, you scan the thing, you log in.

636
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:15,185
Speaker 6:  I say web browser for this one.

637
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:18,825
Speaker 1:  Okay. Yeah. And that's one you can, you can kind of work around a crappy

638
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,425
Speaker 1:  experience.

639
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,025
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Do we have tap to pay though?

640
00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:23,875
Speaker 1:  Oh, because

641
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,395
Speaker 6:  I want that.

642
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:26,755
Speaker 1:  I didn't even have that on the list, but I think we need to.

643
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:30,555
Speaker 6:  But then you have a whole, do you have a wallet and then

644
00:35:31,535 --> 00:35:33,275
Speaker 6:  do you have the Capital One app?

645
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:36,075
Speaker 6:  I don't know.

646
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:40,965
Speaker 1:  You just eventually end up recreating the pixel. Like there just is no way

647
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:42,765
Speaker 1:  to do this without accidentally making a pixel.

648
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,925
Speaker 6:  Yep. It's true. But

649
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,085
Speaker 1:  No, you need tap to pay.

650
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,605
Speaker 6:  I think you need tap to pay

651
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:48,925
Speaker 1:  Crap.

652
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:49,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

653
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:52,385
Speaker 1:  Okay. Here's our tap to pay rule one, no

654
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:54,455
Speaker 1:  one credit card.

655
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:56,655
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You gotta pick, you pick one,

656
00:35:56,995 --> 00:35:59,615
Speaker 1:  You can have a transit cards, whatever, but you get one credit card.

657
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:00,175
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

658
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:03,735
Speaker 1:  That feels, that feels necessary. 'cause otherwise, otherwise you end up

659
00:36:03,735 --> 00:36:04,855
Speaker 1:  down too many weird rabbit holes.

660
00:36:05,145 --> 00:36:08,735
Speaker 6:  Right. And you can like log onto our

661
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:13,015
Speaker 6:  like web portal on your computer to

662
00:36:13,195 --> 00:36:15,935
Speaker 6:  upload your credit card credentials or something,

663
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:20,455
Speaker 6:  you know, encrypted, blah blah blah. It'll be

664
00:36:20,455 --> 00:36:23,615
Speaker 1:  Great. Yeah. Our security is topnotch on this platform. It's so good. Yeah.

665
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,215
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Don't even, don't even worry about that. We've got it covered.

666
00:36:27,515 --> 00:36:29,375
Speaker 1:  All right. Well, is there, that's my whole list. Is there anything else?

667
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:33,175
Speaker 1:  I forgot If we're building our, our perfect minimalist smartphone. Mm.

668
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,535
Speaker 1:  Anything else we desperately need that we don't have?

669
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:40,735
Speaker 6:  We're doing like alarms and stuff. Right? That's just like baked

670
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:41,375
Speaker 6:  into a Yeah,

671
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:45,335
Speaker 1:  That that like the thing shows the time, so it has to kind of

672
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:47,215
Speaker 1:  do alarms and timers. Like I, I feel good about that.

673
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:50,975
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Okay. I, I think I could live,

674
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:54,335
Speaker 6:  I could get through a day with this phone and it wouldn't give me a panic

675
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,305
Speaker 6:  attack too much.

676
00:36:57,205 --> 00:37:00,065
Speaker 1:  Is it weird that, that that actually feels like the bar? Yeah. Right. Like

677
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:03,505
Speaker 1:  I'm good with that. I think it's, it's been a really interesting thing. 'cause

678
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:06,745
Speaker 1:  I think like talking to all the folks who make these minimalist phones, they're

679
00:37:06,745 --> 00:37:10,585
Speaker 1:  basically trying to figure out how to make a phone that is

680
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:14,065
Speaker 1:  so different from all the other things that it doesn't just seem like a worse

681
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,985
Speaker 1:  version of your phone. But actually maybe what we need is just a worse version

682
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:18,625
Speaker 1:  of our phones.

683
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:22,545
Speaker 6:  I keep coming back to like a cellular

684
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:26,625
Speaker 6:  smartwatch is the minimalist phone in like,

685
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:31,945
Speaker 6:  you put in some earbuds, you've got your, your little

686
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:36,185
Speaker 6:  like crappy phone on your wrist, you're good to go. And then

687
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:40,105
Speaker 6:  when you, you know, you can just leave the house without the thing. The

688
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:43,185
Speaker 6:  only thing is you, you know, you don't have the camera, you know, it kind

689
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:46,345
Speaker 6:  of breaks down pretty quickly to wear like maybe there is room for

690
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:50,865
Speaker 6:  a thing that's like phone shaped. But yeah, I think

691
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:54,905
Speaker 6:  for me that's where I keep getting into this loop with

692
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:58,625
Speaker 6:  the minimalist phone is like, well it's gonna be missing this or that.

693
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:03,225
Speaker 6:  That's on the watch that I usually have on anyway.

694
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:07,945
Speaker 6:  Why wouldn't I just use the watch if I wanted

695
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:08,785
Speaker 6:  a break from my phone?

696
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:13,105
Speaker 1:  There have been all these rumors about an Apple watch with a camera

697
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:16,625
Speaker 1:  being kind of in the labs in Cupertino right now. And

698
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:20,505
Speaker 1:  I have gone from thinking that is an absurd, ridiculous idea to being like,

699
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:24,345
Speaker 1:  maybe that's actually the only thing between me and

700
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:27,225
Speaker 1:  being able to use just my watch for really long stretches of time.

701
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:31,265
Speaker 6:  Yeah, but how do you take a picture of, do you do

702
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:35,325
Speaker 6:  like, here we go. Yeah. No, they say geez.

703
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:39,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Maybe this is just the, just have

704
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:42,525
Speaker 6:  a camera on you moment. Like

705
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:43,325
Speaker 1:  Maybe

706
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:47,445
Speaker 6:  We, we invented this thing actually it used to not be part of a, it's like

707
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:50,045
Speaker 6:  paper apps. Like Yeah. We do just have paper

708
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:51,885
Speaker 6:  that exists.

709
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:54,605
Speaker 1:  Yeah. We're pretty, we're pretty good at paper now it turns out.

710
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:55,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah.

711
00:38:56,205 --> 00:39:00,005
Speaker 1:  Alright, well Allison, thank you for doing this with me. If, if we missed

Speaker 1:  is happening with cars. We'll be right back.

Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Andy Hawkins is here. Hi Andy. Hi. How

Speaker 11:  Things are good. You know, it's, we're, we're out here, we're,

724
00:41:50,495 --> 00:41:54,365
Speaker 11:  we're watching these protests, these Tesla protests. I assume

725
00:41:54,365 --> 00:41:56,045
Speaker 11:  that's what I'm here to talk about now. It, I

726
00:41:56,105 --> 00:41:59,765
Speaker 1:  In large part I think I, I have, I I just galaxy brand

727
00:41:59,765 --> 00:42:03,365
Speaker 1:  myself into many corners with all this Tesla stuff. So we're gonna do a little

728
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:06,205
Speaker 1:  bit of that. But let's start with the protest this week because yes, this

729
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:09,685
Speaker 1:  weekend was, it was a big moment in the sort of

730
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:14,285
Speaker 1:  official Tesla Takedown universe of protests. Like what, just sort

731
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:15,365
Speaker 1:  of walk me through what happened this weekend.

732
00:42:15,795 --> 00:42:19,725
Speaker 11:  Yeah, so these protests, they started, I, I guess you could say

733
00:42:20,145 --> 00:42:23,245
Speaker 11:  two months ago, early February I think is when we started seeing some of

734
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:26,565
Speaker 11:  the first ones, people sort of sort of showing up outside of Tesla

735
00:42:27,885 --> 00:42:31,605
Speaker 11:  showrooms and at charging stations and registering their

736
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:35,125
Speaker 11:  opposition to Elon Musk and to Doge and to the sort of

737
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:39,045
Speaker 11:  ransacking of the federal government. And they grew over

738
00:42:39,115 --> 00:42:42,685
Speaker 11:  time and they, we started to see larger and larger crowds

739
00:42:43,265 --> 00:42:47,245
Speaker 11:  and cities all across the country. And, and

740
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:50,645
Speaker 11:  then eventually they decided they needed to get organized. And that was,

741
00:42:50,725 --> 00:42:53,325
Speaker 11:  I think that was sort of like the most interesting thing to me was this

742
00:42:53,325 --> 00:42:56,325
Speaker 11:  was very much a, a bottom up grassroots effort.

743
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,325
Speaker 11:  Very much. There was not really sort of any like national leader to these

744
00:43:00,325 --> 00:43:04,045
Speaker 11:  protests. And they, they sort of realized that that was not really sort

745
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:07,365
Speaker 11:  of a tenable situation. They needed to get organized. So they sort of got

746
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:10,165
Speaker 11:  together, there's been some various kind of, you know,

747
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,845
Speaker 11:  pro-democracy, left-leaning progressive groups that have been

748
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:18,765
Speaker 11:  sort of like involved on the margins, indivisible and a and a

749
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:21,925
Speaker 11:  few others. And so they decided to get together and sort of hold a

750
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:25,845
Speaker 11:  mobilizing effort and targeting this one date

751
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:29,525
Speaker 11:  March 29th, which was last Saturday as sort of their global day of action.

752
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:32,405
Speaker 11:  They were just like, everybody needs to come out. We need to hit every Tesla

753
00:43:32,885 --> 00:43:36,685
Speaker 11:  location in the country. Let's hit some in Europe as well in Canada. And

754
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:40,645
Speaker 11:  really have like a show of force to let sort of like send the message that

755
00:43:40,645 --> 00:43:44,605
Speaker 11:  this is like a, a sustained protest and effort to really, you know, send

756
00:43:44,605 --> 00:43:48,525
Speaker 11:  the message that Elon Musk and and Doge are on their hit list, I guess you

757
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:52,405
Speaker 11:  could say. So Saturday was the day we sent reporters out

758
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:55,965
Speaker 11:  to as many of these protests as we possibly could. I think we hit almost

759
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:59,965
Speaker 11:  a dozen of them in London and in New York and

760
00:43:59,965 --> 00:44:03,085
Speaker 11:  New Jersey, Washington dc Ohio,

761
00:44:04,035 --> 00:44:07,725
Speaker 11:  Florida, Texas, California. Yeah. And

762
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:10,925
Speaker 11:  what we saw was sort of, you know, sort of like what we've been seeing for

763
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:14,645
Speaker 11:  the last few months now, which is a lot of clever

764
00:44:14,775 --> 00:44:18,405
Speaker 11:  signs, a lot of illusions to fascism and to

765
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:22,005
Speaker 11:  Nazism and to, you know, photographs of Musk making his

766
00:44:22,205 --> 00:44:26,045
Speaker 11:  fascist salute at the inauguration and, and a sustain,

767
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:29,725
Speaker 11:  you know, I think an effort largely the, the overall, the broader effort

768
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:33,485
Speaker 11:  was, you know, to to sort of toxify the the Tesla brand and to drive their

769
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:36,925
Speaker 11:  sales down, which was something that we heard from talking to these protestors.

770
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:41,405
Speaker 1:  Right. And it, it seems like, I think in,

771
00:44:41,405 --> 00:44:45,365
Speaker 1:  in an effort to make this a moment, the the movement seems

772
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:47,965
Speaker 1:  to have succeeded, right? Like I, I feel like I saw coverage of this everywhere,

773
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:51,885
Speaker 1:  that if if the goal was to pick a moment to make this a big

774
00:44:51,895 --> 00:44:54,925
Speaker 1:  story, this sort of loose collection of protests,

775
00:44:56,025 --> 00:44:56,805
Speaker 1:  it seems to have worked.

776
00:44:57,275 --> 00:45:01,125
Speaker 11:  Yeah. I mean they've gotten the, the attention of the targets of the protest,

777
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:05,125
Speaker 11:  right? Like Elon Musk and Donald Trump have both

778
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:09,245
Speaker 11:  come out and made several statements

779
00:45:10,215 --> 00:45:13,325
Speaker 11:  about not just the protest necessarily. They, they've been focusing more

780
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:17,165
Speaker 11:  on the, on the, the, the violent acts and the vandalism, which is

781
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:20,525
Speaker 11:  understandable from their position that that's what they would be focused

782
00:45:20,545 --> 00:45:23,645
Speaker 11:  on. But what we definitely heard from the protesters was that this was a

783
00:45:23,845 --> 00:45:26,605
Speaker 11:  peaceful movement. This was a non-violent movement. They do not

784
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:31,285
Speaker 11:  condone any of the, of the vandalism and the arson that's taken

785
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,925
Speaker 11:  place. They see that as something that's separate to their movement.

786
00:45:35,585 --> 00:45:38,365
Speaker 11:  But obviously I, I would say on the Musk and the Trump side, there's an

787
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:42,245
Speaker 11:  effort to tie those things together. And so, you know,

788
00:45:42,245 --> 00:45:45,805
Speaker 11:  that's where we got Trump talking about charges of domestic terrorism, although

789
00:45:45,805 --> 00:45:48,485
Speaker 11:  we have yet to see anyone be charged with domestic terrorism, yet there

790
00:45:48,485 --> 00:45:52,085
Speaker 11:  have been arrests of people who have been charged with setting fires and

791
00:45:52,565 --> 00:45:56,485
Speaker 11:  defacing Tesla property, but none of these actual terrorism

792
00:45:56,485 --> 00:46:00,365
Speaker 11:  charges quite yet. That may be difficult to actually accomplish. And then

793
00:46:00,365 --> 00:46:04,125
Speaker 11:  maybe you had Musk on, on Fox last week talking about, you know, going

794
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:07,645
Speaker 11:  after people who are pushing Tesla propaganda. He, he said, right.

795
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:11,525
Speaker 11:  So I, it's clear that they have their attention and I think that that is,

796
00:46:12,595 --> 00:46:15,565
Speaker 11:  it's been galvanizing for the protesters. I think that they feel that they're

797
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:18,125
Speaker 11:  succeeding because they have Musk's attention.

798
00:46:18,995 --> 00:46:22,885
Speaker 1:  Well, and it's, it's been really interesting to watch the folks engaged

799
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,325
Speaker 1:  in these protests try to explain what It is that they're protesting.

800
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:30,285
Speaker 1:  Because on the one hand, this is all pointed at Tesla, right?

801
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:34,365
Speaker 1:  They're going to Tesla showrooms, they're going to Tesla buildings and protesting

802
00:46:34,365 --> 00:46:36,765
Speaker 1:  Tesla. It's called Tesla Takedown. Like that is the thing that they're doing.

803
00:46:37,705 --> 00:46:41,375
Speaker 1:  But it's not about Tesla. This is like very specifically pointed

804
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:45,295
Speaker 1:  at Elon Musk. And I think a to some extent that has

805
00:46:45,315 --> 00:46:48,135
Speaker 1:  worked, right? Like you, you mentioned the Fox News interview he did, and

806
00:46:48,135 --> 00:46:51,855
Speaker 1:  he basically goes on TV and is like sort of Weebly saying, my businesses

807
00:46:51,855 --> 00:46:55,335
Speaker 1:  are struggling like that. I I assume that's what these protestors are after,

808
00:46:55,335 --> 00:46:58,495
Speaker 1:  right? Like that that is the goal is you want, you want him to feel it at

809
00:46:58,495 --> 00:47:02,255
Speaker 1:  the end of the process. But I, I do continue to wonder

810
00:47:02,955 --> 00:47:06,815
Speaker 1:  is, is pointing all of this energy at Tesla the right way

811
00:47:06,815 --> 00:47:10,615
Speaker 1:  to get to Elon Musk, does that seem like It is working for these protesters

812
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:13,375
Speaker 1:  because they're not mad at Tesla nearly in the same way that they're mad

813
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,975
Speaker 1:  at the guy who runs Tesla, right? Or am I, am I overstating the Elon Musk?

814
00:47:17,195 --> 00:47:17,415
Speaker 1:  No,

815
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:20,575
Speaker 11:  No. I, I I don't, I no, I I think, I think you're right about that. They

816
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,415
Speaker 11:  are mad at Elon Musk. And I think the understanding is that Tesla is sort

817
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,415
Speaker 11:  of the unfortunate, you know, byproduct of the, what they have to do, right?

818
00:47:27,415 --> 00:47:31,285
Speaker 11:  Because his wealth and his power are very much

819
00:47:31,505 --> 00:47:34,965
Speaker 11:  linked to Tesla. His o ownership of, you know, around

820
00:47:35,205 --> 00:47:38,925
Speaker 11:  13% of Tesla stock is sort of what comprises the

821
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:42,445
Speaker 11:  bulk of his net worth, right? And It is what, you know, he's had to sell

822
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:45,765
Speaker 11:  Tesla stock in order to fund the purchase of Twitter. You know, that's sort

823
00:47:45,765 --> 00:47:49,565
Speaker 11:  of how he leverages his power is through his ownership stake in

824
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:53,485
Speaker 11:  Tesla. And so yes, Tesla is sort of just what they have to, they

825
00:47:53,485 --> 00:47:57,445
Speaker 11:  have to focus on, right? This is a boycott, it's a, an effort to drive

826
00:47:57,455 --> 00:48:00,485
Speaker 11:  sales down, to convince people to sell their Teslas,

827
00:48:01,265 --> 00:48:04,805
Speaker 11:  to make the, the used market of Tesla, you know, sort of chaotic to,

828
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:09,565
Speaker 11:  and ultimately to affect his ownership and his net worth of

829
00:48:09,565 --> 00:48:13,045
Speaker 11:  the company. I I don't think any of the folks that you would encounter out

830
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:16,205
Speaker 11:  there at these protests would say that they are opposed the idea of electric

831
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:20,125
Speaker 11:  cars or the furtherance of, of electric car sales. And you see some people

832
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:23,525
Speaker 11:  with signs that say, we don't, we like electric cars, we just don't like

833
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:27,405
Speaker 11:  Tesla. Right? And so that, that is sort of the, the, the, the

834
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:31,245
Speaker 11:  ultimate mission here. It's not to, to, I think to sink the

835
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:35,325
Speaker 11:  electric car market, but in some ways, obviously Tesla is a

836
00:48:35,325 --> 00:48:38,725
Speaker 11:  huge chunk of the electric car market, but It is, It is

837
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:42,805
Speaker 11:  specifically about making the Tesla stock price go down

838
00:48:43,145 --> 00:48:46,885
Speaker 11:  and making Elon Musk's net worth and thus his political power diminished.

839
00:48:47,685 --> 00:48:50,965
Speaker 1:  I mean that's, that's the piece of the, the sort of cognitive dissonance

840
00:48:50,965 --> 00:48:54,885
Speaker 1:  of all of this that just continues to blow my mind. Like my overarching

841
00:48:54,885 --> 00:48:58,325
Speaker 1:  assumption would be that the people protesting outside of Tesla

842
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:02,445
Speaker 1:  showrooms this weekend were the exact same demographic of people who

843
00:49:02,585 --> 00:49:06,285
Speaker 1:  may have been the optimal Tesla buyer 10 years ago.

844
00:49:06,515 --> 00:49:10,285
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like, and the, and the cars have not changed, right? Like it's,

845
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:14,165
Speaker 1:  it's just the, what they mean in the world has done a, like a full

846
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:17,365
Speaker 1:  180 to the point where like the people who used to walk in and spend money

847
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:21,365
Speaker 1:  are now protesting outside of the building. And It is like, if, if

848
00:49:21,365 --> 00:49:24,525
Speaker 1:  you want a story of what has happened to American society in 10 years, like

849
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:27,045
Speaker 1:  there It is, man, it's just bizarre.

850
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:30,325
Speaker 11:  Yeah. It, it's crazy. And they'll, they'll point to, they'll say, you know,

851
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:34,285
Speaker 11:  we, we would've been fully in support of Tesla's mission, right? Like Tesla's

852
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:37,925
Speaker 11:  mission for a long time was to, of further the, the mission of,

853
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:41,925
Speaker 11:  of new energy, clean energy, renewable energy, you know,

854
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:45,485
Speaker 11:  Musk for a long time talked about, you know, electric cars and battery storage

855
00:49:45,545 --> 00:49:48,125
Speaker 11:  and all of these things as a way to save the world. And I think a lot of

856
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:51,485
Speaker 11:  those people would've ascribed to that mission. But, you know, their argument

857
00:49:51,485 --> 00:49:55,325
Speaker 11:  would be, you know, he changed first, right? He was the one that got

858
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:59,365
Speaker 11:  red pilled and bought into all of these Twitter conspiracies and moved

859
00:49:59,365 --> 00:50:02,645
Speaker 11:  to the right and ultimately endorsed Donald Trump and funded his campaign

860
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:07,125
Speaker 11:  and is now heading this effort to slash the federal government and

861
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:10,925
Speaker 11:  fire workers and cancel humanitarian aid. So I think a lot of these folks

862
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,605
Speaker 11:  would say, you know, it wasn't, wasn't us that changed. We liked Tesla,

863
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:17,605
Speaker 11:  we liked our cars, but you know, it's, it's him that changed and now

864
00:50:17,605 --> 00:50:21,125
Speaker 11:  we have to sort of like respond to that. So yeah, It is, It is an incredibly

865
00:50:21,475 --> 00:50:25,205
Speaker 11:  cognitively dissonant mo moment I think ultimately, and I think a lot of

866
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:27,965
Speaker 11:  these protesters would, would, would fully admit to that as well.

867
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:31,685
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's, it's just, it's just strange that it ended up like this.

868
00:50:32,985 --> 00:50:36,965
Speaker 1:  So what, what is the sort of metric we're looking at to see if

869
00:50:36,965 --> 00:50:40,925
Speaker 1:  this is working? Obviously you can look at Tesla stock price. I will

870
00:50:40,925 --> 00:50:44,765
Speaker 1:  just say candidly, I, my, my increasing belief is that stock prices have

871
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:48,485
Speaker 1:  nothing to do with anything are completely divorced from reality. Especially

872
00:50:48,485 --> 00:50:51,125
Speaker 1:  when it comes to things like Tesla, which have been about other things for

873
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:51,605
Speaker 1:  a long time,

874
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:56,885
Speaker 1:  but if, if you're looking at sort of what, what is, is this working or is

875
00:50:56,885 --> 00:51:00,485
Speaker 1:  it not? Which direction is Tesla headed? What do we look at?

876
00:51:00,715 --> 00:51:04,445
Speaker 11:  Yeah, so I think this week especially, we're gonna get some new data that's

877
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:07,605
Speaker 11:  gonna, I think, tell a lot about what's been going on in this sort of the

878
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:11,045
Speaker 11:  present moment. We've already seen signs of it. Right at the beginning of

879
00:51:11,045 --> 00:51:14,965
Speaker 11:  the year, we saw Tesla report that, that it had flat sales

880
00:51:15,065 --> 00:51:17,725
Speaker 11:  for the year and that it's, you know, its deliveries were actually going

881
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:21,205
Speaker 11:  down. And then in the last few months we started getting some regional data

882
00:51:21,275 --> 00:51:25,245
Speaker 11:  from Europe and from China about how its sales had

883
00:51:25,245 --> 00:51:28,125
Speaker 11:  dropped. I think in, in Europe over the last two months, sales were down

884
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:32,005
Speaker 11:  45% year over year in some markets, even more. I

885
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,845
Speaker 11:  think Germany was down to like over 70% year over year. And now

886
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:38,965
Speaker 11:  we're gonna see, wow, the, the, the first quarter sales data be reported

887
00:51:39,505 --> 00:51:42,765
Speaker 11:  on Wednesday. Even a lot of the, the Tesla

888
00:51:42,915 --> 00:51:46,765
Speaker 11:  optimists and the bulls out there are expecting it's gonna be a

889
00:51:46,765 --> 00:51:50,645
Speaker 11:  rough number for Tesla. They're assuming that it, it could be down

890
00:51:50,665 --> 00:51:54,605
Speaker 11:  by as much as nine to 10% year over year in terms of the number

891
00:51:54,605 --> 00:51:58,365
Speaker 11:  of, of vehicles that it produced, but also the ones that it's delivered,

892
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,725
Speaker 11:  which is basically a proxy for, for sales. So

893
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,965
Speaker 11:  that's gonna be the thing that people are really gonna be zeroed in on.

894
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:09,045
Speaker 11:  I, it doesn't sound like even Tesla is really optimistic about this

895
00:52:09,245 --> 00:52:13,045
Speaker 11:  delivery report this week. So that should be sort of a real clear

896
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:16,245
Speaker 11:  signal about how bad this brand image that Tesla has at the moment.

897
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:21,325
Speaker 1:  The, the like get rid of Elon Musk energy does seem

898
00:52:21,325 --> 00:52:25,125
Speaker 1:  to be increasing. I don't think it's remotely realistic, correct me if

899
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:29,005
Speaker 1:  I'm wrong, but it it, the, the number of people with

900
00:52:29,005 --> 00:52:32,125
Speaker 1:  some influence who are starting to say things like Tesla needs a CEO who

901
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:36,045
Speaker 1:  is not Elon Musk. That that noise seems to be getting louder. Is there any

902
00:52:36,565 --> 00:52:39,045
Speaker 1:  substance behind any of that as far as you can tell? Yeah, it

903
00:52:39,045 --> 00:52:42,165
Speaker 11:  Still seems to be pretty much on the fringe as far as I can tell. Like,

904
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:45,845
Speaker 11:  you've got like investors like Ross Gerber who, who have been saying, you

905
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:49,005
Speaker 11:  know, who have been sort of like Musk skeptics for a long time. Mm. Saying

906
00:52:49,005 --> 00:52:52,085
Speaker 11:  that he thinks that there needs to be a change at the top. Obviously he,

907
00:52:52,145 --> 00:52:56,125
Speaker 11:  he owns some, some Tesla stock, but it, I wouldn't say that it's anything

908
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:59,885
Speaker 11:  significant to, as a to point to I think larger problems within

909
00:52:59,905 --> 00:53:03,765
Speaker 11:  the company. And certainly the board itself hasn't, hasn't said anything.

910
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:07,285
Speaker 11:  I think, you know, Robin Denholm, who was, who's the board chair was in

911
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:11,085
Speaker 11:  Australia like a week ago, and a lot of reporters tried to sort of, you

912
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:14,405
Speaker 11:  know, get her corner her and ask her about Tesla. She just refused to say

913
00:53:14,565 --> 00:53:18,085
Speaker 11:  anything about it. So, you know, the board is still seen as being sort of

914
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:22,045
Speaker 11:  completely beholden to Musk. I mean, his brother's on the board, James

915
00:53:22,045 --> 00:53:25,045
Speaker 11:  Murdock's on the board, you know, it's not it, I wouldn't say it's a Tesla

916
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:29,205
Speaker 11:  Takedown friendly situation, but, you know, and,

917
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:32,405
Speaker 11:  and there's still like a lot of people who are saying, you know, like if

918
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:35,765
Speaker 11:  you're, if you're someone who's optimistic about Tesla's future, don't worry

919
00:53:35,765 --> 00:53:38,765
Speaker 11:  about the current moment. You know, we've got, there's lots of things to

920
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:42,485
Speaker 11:  look at at the horizon. There's a new refreshed model y that's gonna be

921
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,405
Speaker 11:  coming down the pipe that's Tesla's bestselling vehicle was the bestselling

922
00:53:45,405 --> 00:53:49,125
Speaker 11:  vehicle in the world. And there, there, there's a refresh model

923
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,565
Speaker 11:  that's gonna be coming soon. And then obviously there's Tesla's claims about

924
00:53:52,865 --> 00:53:56,605
Speaker 11:  AI and robotics and other things that have been sort of the bulk of what

925
00:53:56,605 --> 00:53:59,805
Speaker 11:  people have been using as, as sort of justification for

926
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:03,605
Speaker 11:  the insane values that Tesla has been, has been enjoying over the years.

927
00:54:03,605 --> 00:54:07,325
Speaker 11:  Right. So it does seem like there's, there, there needs to be more

928
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:11,325
Speaker 11:  pieces connected, more dots connected before we start to say that Musk is

929
00:54:11,325 --> 00:54:13,485
Speaker 11:  truly in trouble, which I would say he's, he's not at the moment.

930
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:16,805
Speaker 1:  Okay. It makes me think of like the meta situation where at every shareholder

931
00:54:16,805 --> 00:54:19,685
Speaker 1:  meeting somebody's like, fire Mark Zuckerberg and Mark says, no thank you,

932
00:54:19,745 --> 00:54:23,045
Speaker 1:  and then everybody moves on. Exactly. That's essentially where we're Yes.

933
00:54:24,185 --> 00:54:27,525
Speaker 1:  To your point on like the, the model y and the AI stuff and you know, must

934
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:30,845
Speaker 1:  talks about the cyber cab and like there is, there is a lot of stuff

935
00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:35,325
Speaker 1:  in some version of the pipeline at Tesla, but I continue to find myself

936
00:54:35,325 --> 00:54:39,245
Speaker 1:  wondering, like, has this company, and I'm purely just

937
00:54:39,445 --> 00:54:43,285
Speaker 1:  talking like as a, as a financial animal for Elon Musk's net worth, because

938
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:45,725
Speaker 1:  I think we have to talk to them about them as two different things, right?

939
00:54:45,725 --> 00:54:48,285
Speaker 1:  Like there's the, there's the car company and there's the stock price and

940
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,885
Speaker 1:  they are like totally different things.

941
00:54:51,395 --> 00:54:55,245
Speaker 1:  Does any of that matter anymore? Like part of me wonders now if, if the

942
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:59,165
Speaker 1:  idea of Tesla is so politicized and so directly tied

943
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:02,965
Speaker 1:  to Elon Musk himself that nobody, nobody cares about the model y

944
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:05,405
Speaker 1:  anymore. I don't like if the model Y comes out and It is amazing,

945
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:09,345
Speaker 1:  is it gonna change one person's mind about whether or not they should buy

946
00:55:09,345 --> 00:55:11,185
Speaker 1:  a Tesla right now? I just have a hard time seeing it.

947
00:55:11,185 --> 00:55:15,065
Speaker 11:  Yeah, it's, it's a really good question. I think that, you know, there's

948
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:17,945
Speaker 11:  some arguments that can be made that Tesla's brand is pretty thoroughly

949
00:55:17,945 --> 00:55:21,745
Speaker 11:  toxic at the, at the moment, but it's not clear as to how

950
00:55:21,745 --> 00:55:25,305
Speaker 11:  many people take politics into account when they're out buying a vehicle.

951
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,905
Speaker 11:  And, and that's fair if Tesla is able to actually come out with a, with

952
00:55:28,945 --> 00:55:31,905
Speaker 11:  a even lower cost model, which they've said that they plan on doing at some

953
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:35,585
Speaker 11:  point this year, we're not sure exactly how lower cost that's gonna be.

954
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:38,465
Speaker 11:  Is that gonna be like a, you know, the sort of the, the long rumor

955
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:42,305
Speaker 11:  $25,000 model two that's been talked about, although I think it's being

956
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:45,945
Speaker 11:  called the Model Q now, so I don't quote me on either of those things, but

957
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:49,225
Speaker 11:  you know, if, if they're able to actually achieve this, I think would be

958
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:52,705
Speaker 11:  a very significant achievement for, for the company, which is a lower a,

959
00:55:52,885 --> 00:55:56,265
Speaker 11:  an actual lower cost electric vehicle, some sort of like

960
00:55:57,315 --> 00:56:00,945
Speaker 11:  strip to the bones model three and beat all of the other legacy

961
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:04,265
Speaker 11:  OEMs that are out there. I think you could make the argument that Tesla

962
00:56:04,355 --> 00:56:07,945
Speaker 11:  could see a significant bounce back. And then, you know, there's another

963
00:56:07,945 --> 00:56:10,705
Speaker 11:  thing that I I I've sort of been thinking about in the back of my head,

964
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:14,345
Speaker 11:  which was do you remember the delete Uber movement?

965
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:18,545
Speaker 11:  Oh yeah. And during the, of course the first Trump administration when there

966
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:22,505
Speaker 11:  was a boycott at the JFK airport over like deportations,

967
00:56:22,685 --> 00:56:26,445
Speaker 11:  and I don't even remember like the specifics, but like Uber wasn't boycotting

968
00:56:27,035 --> 00:56:30,405
Speaker 11:  airport pickups in the same way that like taxi drivers were. And so

969
00:56:30,835 --> 00:56:34,525
Speaker 11:  everybody got mad at Uber plus, like Travis Knick was gonna be on a bo

970
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:38,045
Speaker 11:  on some sort of CEO panel with Trump. Everyone got mad at Uber. And so there

971
00:56:38,045 --> 00:56:41,885
Speaker 11:  was this hashtag delete Uber moment. Everyone's like, delete Uber, get rid

972
00:56:41,885 --> 00:56:45,765
Speaker 11:  of Uber, you know, we don't need this company anymore. That petered out

973
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:49,685
Speaker 11:  after like a couple months. Yeah. And as far as I I I can tell Uber's

974
00:56:49,755 --> 00:56:53,605
Speaker 11:  fine right now, it's profitable like it's doing well. Like these things

975
00:56:53,635 --> 00:56:57,605
Speaker 11:  like tend to like happen in, you know, fits and starts. And

976
00:56:57,605 --> 00:57:00,725
Speaker 11:  it's not clear to me, like I'm sure the Tesla Takedown people will say,

977
00:57:00,745 --> 00:57:03,925
Speaker 11:  you know, this is, we're here to stay, we're here to, to make, you know,

978
00:57:04,355 --> 00:57:07,645
Speaker 11:  Elon Musk's, you know, life of living hell. And they certainly, it's been

979
00:57:07,645 --> 00:57:11,445
Speaker 11:  working and it's a very different situation than the delete Uber situation

980
00:57:11,465 --> 00:57:15,325
Speaker 11:  in many ways. Like Musk is way more entrenched and embedded in,

981
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:17,805
Speaker 11:  in the Trump administration now than Uber ever was.

982
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:22,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah. This will be an interesting test of, of like humanity's ability

983
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:26,045
Speaker 1:  to move through news cycles, right? Because It is, yes, It is generally true

984
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:30,605
Speaker 1:  in modern times that if you're in trouble all you have to do is wait and

985
00:57:30,605 --> 00:57:33,685
Speaker 1:  eventually everyone will move on to something else. And, and the the lesson

986
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:37,365
Speaker 1:  learned is like, don't apologize, just, just wait and eventually

987
00:57:37,605 --> 00:57:41,245
Speaker 1:  everyone's attention will disappear. This feels like maybe the most

988
00:57:41,245 --> 00:57:44,525
Speaker 1:  extreme test we've ever had of that exact like,

989
00:57:44,645 --> 00:57:46,845
Speaker 11:  I mean, I would argue that the Trump, there's the Trump example, right?

990
00:57:46,845 --> 00:57:50,405
Speaker 11:  Like there was January 6th and an actual insurrection. Totally,

991
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:54,165
Speaker 11:  yeah. And like Trump was supposed to be like, you know, banished to the

992
00:57:54,165 --> 00:57:57,645
Speaker 11:  wilderness after all that happened and, and yet here we are. So I mean if

993
00:57:57,645 --> 00:58:01,565
Speaker 11:  Trump can make a comeback, Musk is, I think certainly looking at that

994
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:05,485
Speaker 11:  example, right? Yeah. Being sort of as close as he is to

995
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:09,405
Speaker 11:  him It is seen, you know, like maybe the same can be for me.

996
00:58:09,425 --> 00:58:11,805
Speaker 11:  Why can't, if not him, why not me? Yeah,

997
00:58:11,805 --> 00:58:15,565
Speaker 1:  Fair enough. Alright, so one other thing going on in the car industry this

998
00:58:15,565 --> 00:58:18,645
Speaker 1:  week of the many, many, many things going on in the car industry this week,

999
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:23,405
Speaker 1:  big looming tariffs. I i, if I am an

1000
00:58:23,405 --> 00:58:27,325
Speaker 1:  automaker, am I just in full 10 out of 10 chaos

1001
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:29,005
Speaker 1:  crisis mode right now? Is that where everybody is?

1002
00:58:29,035 --> 00:58:33,005
Speaker 11:  It's it's fully panic mode, I would say. Okay. For the, for the auto industry.

1003
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:36,885
Speaker 11:  I've been talking with a lot of people at these companies and, and smart

1004
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:40,365
Speaker 11:  people, analysts and others who, who sort of, whose job It is to watch this

1005
00:58:40,365 --> 00:58:43,485
Speaker 11:  stuff and, and they're saying that there's, there's just really no way

1006
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:47,925
Speaker 11:  that you can avoid passing this cost on to customers. Like these

1007
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:51,885
Speaker 11:  tariffs are gonna come down, every car in America can suddenly it could

1008
00:58:51,885 --> 00:58:54,285
Speaker 11:  be made in America, but that doesn't mean that the parts that go into the

1009
00:58:54,285 --> 00:58:58,125
Speaker 11:  car are necessarily originate in America. And so, you know,

1010
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:02,005
Speaker 11:  you've got something along the lines of, you know, up to 50% of a,

1011
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:05,685
Speaker 11:  of the, the parts that are inside a car come from sort of foreign countries.

1012
00:59:05,685 --> 00:59:09,525
Speaker 11:  Mexico and Canada especially are, are a huge hubs for

1013
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:13,605
Speaker 11:  these parts. So with 40 to 50% of auto parts coming from abroad,

1014
00:59:13,605 --> 00:59:17,565
Speaker 11:  there's just really no way that these costs are, are, can be absorbed by

1015
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:20,525
Speaker 11:  the companies that make the, make the vehicles. And so I think a lot of

1016
00:59:20,575 --> 00:59:24,085
Speaker 11:  smart people are predicting, you know, something around the lines of five

1017
00:59:24,105 --> 00:59:27,885
Speaker 11:  to $10,000 price increases just right out of the

1018
00:59:27,885 --> 00:59:31,845
Speaker 11:  gates. Wow. When these tariffs go into effect on April 2nd,

1019
00:59:32,405 --> 00:59:35,445
Speaker 11:  that is to say if they go into effect, right? We've been, we've been sort

1020
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:39,005
Speaker 11:  of going back and forth and back and forth on whether Trump is actually

1021
00:59:39,005 --> 00:59:42,165
Speaker 11:  gonna do this, you know, what can be said to actually dissuade him from

1022
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:46,005
Speaker 11:  putting these tariffs in place. It, it seems like these ones are actually

1023
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:49,365
Speaker 11:  gonna come through, but you have to sort of allow for the fact that this

1024
00:59:49,365 --> 00:59:53,245
Speaker 11:  is a very unpredictable, unpredictable, fluid situation. Yeah. But you know,

1025
00:59:53,245 --> 00:59:56,085
Speaker 11:  I, I read today, I was reading a report today that the, some of, you know,

1026
00:59:56,085 --> 00:59:59,365
Speaker 11:  sort of assume that this is gonna add a hundred billion dollars

1027
00:59:59,905 --> 01:00:03,285
Speaker 11:  in costs annually to the auto industry.

1028
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:03,885
Speaker 1:  Wow.

1029
01:00:04,325 --> 01:00:08,245
Speaker 11:  I mean this is a incredibly tight margin industry. They cannot

1030
01:00:08,425 --> 01:00:12,005
Speaker 11:  absorb these costs. People are gonna be, be paying higher prices for cars

1031
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:15,365
Speaker 11:  and there's really just no good reason for, there's no reason at all

1032
01:00:16,105 --> 01:00:19,325
Speaker 11:  why this is happening other than to satisfy Donald Trump's

1033
01:00:19,835 --> 01:00:23,085
Speaker 11:  bizarre theories about what tariffs are.

1034
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:27,165
Speaker 1:  He does love a tariff, he loves a tariff. Just, it's just, it's, that's honestly,

1035
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,165
Speaker 1:  it might be all there is to it. He, the man just loves a tariff. So if I'm,

1036
01:00:30,165 --> 01:00:33,965
Speaker 1:  if I'm an automaker, it seems like the, the short term thing that you

1037
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:37,085
Speaker 1:  do is just immediately raise prices. Right? And I I I've, I've been reading

1038
01:00:37,085 --> 01:00:40,205
Speaker 1:  similar stuff, right? Like there and there was one thing that was like, I,

1039
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:43,645
Speaker 1:  it was quoting somebody, some executive from one of these automakers who

1040
01:00:43,645 --> 01:00:46,885
Speaker 1:  was like, yeah, the prices are gonna go up and then prices don't go down.

1041
01:00:46,985 --> 01:00:50,565
Speaker 1:  So they're just, this all might go away, but the prices stay up because that's

1042
01:00:50,565 --> 01:00:53,765
Speaker 1:  what, that's what happens. So that's the like, immediate thing.

1043
01:00:54,705 --> 01:00:58,645
Speaker 1:  The the underneath thing seems to be potentially

1044
01:00:58,645 --> 01:01:01,925
Speaker 1:  the, the like long-term goal of the Trump administration is that all these

1045
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:04,565
Speaker 1:  companies start making huge efforts to move stuff into the United States.

1046
01:01:04,945 --> 01:01:07,765
Speaker 1:  Are you, are you hearing rumblings of companies thinking about like, okay,

1047
01:01:07,825 --> 01:01:11,685
Speaker 1:  we have to retool everything in order to make this stuff work or prices

1048
01:01:11,785 --> 01:01:14,005
Speaker 1:  are just gonna go up, that's life moving on.

1049
01:01:14,145 --> 01:01:17,685
Speaker 11:  So there, there was already kind of like a bit of an onshoring movement

1050
01:01:17,685 --> 01:01:20,725
Speaker 11:  going on during the Biden administration where he was offering all of these

1051
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:24,685
Speaker 11:  incentives and tax cuts and things like that for companies that

1052
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:27,725
Speaker 11:  were bringing their manufacturing, especially EV and battery manufacturing

1053
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:31,285
Speaker 11:  to the us. A lot of that is still happening as far as I can tell. I mean

1054
01:01:31,285 --> 01:01:35,085
Speaker 11:  these are huge projects, billion dollar projects that take

1055
01:01:35,365 --> 01:01:39,125
Speaker 11:  multiple years to line up all the investors and the partners and the, and

1056
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:42,885
Speaker 11:  the land acquisitions and all of these things. So It is just gonna take

1057
01:01:42,925 --> 01:01:46,125
Speaker 11:  a long time for that to happen. Whether or not you start to see companies

1058
01:01:46,265 --> 01:01:50,125
Speaker 11:  try to start to, to do the same because of the tariffs. I think you're starting

1059
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:53,805
Speaker 11:  to see some companies sort of repackage old announcements as,

1060
01:01:53,905 --> 01:01:57,485
Speaker 11:  as sort of responding to the present moment and presenting them as something

1061
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:01,245
Speaker 11:  new. But that said, it's just not something that can be

1062
01:02:01,245 --> 01:02:04,885
Speaker 11:  flipped from week to week. You know, it's, this is something if you, if

1063
01:02:04,885 --> 01:02:08,565
Speaker 11:  you take into account just the complexity of supply chains, you know,

1064
01:02:08,565 --> 01:02:11,965
Speaker 11:  trying to create new factories, new hubs, this is a four to five to six

1065
01:02:11,965 --> 01:02:15,805
Speaker 11:  year timeframe that a lot of these happen happen. So it,

1066
01:02:15,805 --> 01:02:18,925
Speaker 11:  it would just be sort of a massive frustration for the industry, I think

1067
01:02:19,825 --> 01:02:22,845
Speaker 11:  to, to sort of bring all of these supply chains into the United States.

1068
01:02:23,225 --> 01:02:27,205
Speaker 11:  And, and from what I can tell the idea that you could have a, a vehicle

1069
01:02:27,555 --> 01:02:31,525
Speaker 11:  that is made with 100% US made parts

1070
01:02:31,745 --> 01:02:35,725
Speaker 11:  and labor and manufacturing and everything is basically a fantasy at

1071
01:02:35,725 --> 01:02:39,485
Speaker 11:  this point and is just not something that even if they undertook

1072
01:02:39,485 --> 01:02:42,325
Speaker 11:  this massive effort, which would cost them hundreds of billions of dollars

1073
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:46,045
Speaker 11:  and take many, many years, even that is not necessarily going to result

1074
01:02:46,145 --> 01:02:49,765
Speaker 11:  in I think whatever the sort of fantasy that Trump has in in, in his mind

1075
01:02:49,775 --> 01:02:53,285
Speaker 11:  about this, you know, sort of domestic renaissance in

1076
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:53,845
Speaker 11:  manufacturing.

1077
01:02:54,615 --> 01:02:57,805
Speaker 1:  Right. And I would assume that the, the uncertainty of it all is also part

1078
01:02:57,805 --> 01:03:01,525
Speaker 1:  of the challenge here. That if I'm, if I'm running a car company, like I

1079
01:03:01,585 --> 01:03:05,285
Speaker 1:  I'm, I'm not actually sure it's smart or prudent right now to

1080
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:08,525
Speaker 1:  say we're gonna make these giant sweeping changes because this is the new

1081
01:03:08,525 --> 01:03:11,005
Speaker 1:  normal. Like, God only knows what the new normal is.

1082
01:03:12,225 --> 01:03:14,285
Speaker 11:  And, and the thing that, that I thought was really interesting, there's

1083
01:03:14,285 --> 01:03:17,005
Speaker 11:  a lot of, there was a lot of stories in the last few weeks that are like,

1084
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:20,485
Speaker 11:  oh, this is great for Tesla, right? Tesla is like one of the most domestic

1085
01:03:20,485 --> 01:03:23,645
Speaker 11:  manufacturers that we have. They make all their cars in Texas and California.

1086
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:27,165
Speaker 11:  A lot of their parts are made here in the United States, including their

1087
01:03:27,445 --> 01:03:31,405
Speaker 11:  batteries. But even Tesla is exposed to this and they're gonna probably,

1088
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:35,205
Speaker 11:  we're gonna see prices go up for them as well, which is, you know,

1089
01:03:35,385 --> 01:03:39,325
Speaker 11:  on top of already like declining EV incentives, you know, less

1090
01:03:39,425 --> 01:03:43,405
Speaker 11:  tax breaks, less, you know, less charging incentives. So, you know, I

1091
01:03:43,405 --> 01:03:46,805
Speaker 11:  think it's, it's safe to say that everyone is exposed on this, including

1092
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:50,605
Speaker 11:  Tesla, which all, and I think Musk has himself has also said that, you know,

1093
01:03:50,605 --> 01:03:53,965
Speaker 11:  we're not gonna be unscathed through all this. So it's really just kind

1094
01:03:53,965 --> 01:03:57,325
Speaker 11:  of just a, it's a huge head scratcher I think for everybody.

1095
01:03:58,285 --> 01:04:00,645
Speaker 11:  'cause we were assuming that there was gonna be some, at least some carve

1096
01:04:00,645 --> 01:04:03,485
Speaker 11:  outs or maybe some exemptions, but it, it doesn't appear to be that the

1097
01:04:03,485 --> 01:04:04,405
Speaker 11:  case at, at this stage.

1098
01:04:04,835 --> 01:04:08,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah, well, like you said, we'll see a bunch of that is coming due this week.

1099
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:10,325
Speaker 1:  So we, we will, we will see one way or another.

1100
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,125
Speaker 11:  Exciting times, exciting times.

1101
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:16,765
Speaker 1:  Let, let's, let's end on a more exciting note. Tell me I'm crazy

1102
01:04:16,985 --> 01:04:19,165
Speaker 1:  for being kind of into the new Nissan Leaf.

1103
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:20,445
Speaker 11:  You're

1104
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:22,925
Speaker 1:  Not, you wrote about this thing and, and I, I find the leaf fascinating.

1105
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,685
Speaker 1:  Someday you're gonna come on the show and we're gonna do the whole story

1106
01:04:24,685 --> 01:04:28,045
Speaker 1:  of the Nissan Leaf, which I think is like the weirdest, most interesting

1107
01:04:28,045 --> 01:04:31,885
Speaker 1:  sort of footnote in the history of EVs, but there's a new

1108
01:04:31,885 --> 01:04:33,605
Speaker 1:  leaf and it's kind of hot and I'm kind of into it.

1109
01:04:33,805 --> 01:04:37,685
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I know. It's the same, right? It was kind of like similar to me.

1110
01:04:37,845 --> 01:04:41,165
Speaker 11:  I got similar vibes from the, the new Toyota Prius a little bit. Like, I

1111
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:44,805
Speaker 11:  was like, oh, they, they took something that was like a big old paperweight

1112
01:04:44,805 --> 01:04:48,725
Speaker 11:  that nobody really liked that much, but sold like incredible numbers. Like

1113
01:04:48,725 --> 01:04:51,965
Speaker 11:  it did really well, the new Nissan Leaf for a long time and they kind of

1114
01:04:51,965 --> 01:04:54,725
Speaker 11:  like sexed it up a little bit. Gave, you know, gave it a bit of a glow up

1115
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:58,605
Speaker 11:  and it looked really good. We, we we're still kind of waiting for like the

1116
01:04:58,605 --> 01:05:01,005
Speaker 11:  full picture of like what it's gonna look like. We don't really have a,

1117
01:05:01,005 --> 01:05:04,565
Speaker 11:  like a, a lot of the specs, battery range, anything like that. The old leaf

1118
01:05:04,585 --> 01:05:08,325
Speaker 11:  had terrible range, but yeah, it was a pioneer, right? It was out there

1119
01:05:08,895 --> 01:05:12,805
Speaker 11:  first full like medium range ev to

1120
01:05:12,805 --> 01:05:16,725
Speaker 11:  go on sale even before the, the Tesla model s So it

1121
01:05:16,725 --> 01:05:20,405
Speaker 11:  was, it kind of like proved the market I think for a lot of OEMs

1122
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:23,365
Speaker 11:  that this was something that people would actually be interested in buying

1123
01:05:23,865 --> 01:05:27,005
Speaker 11:  and the rumors that was gonna be that, that that Nissan was gonna get, get

1124
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:29,405
Speaker 11:  rid of it for a long time. Nissan's going through a lot of problems right

1125
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:33,005
Speaker 11:  now. Their sales have dropped just dramatically over the last

1126
01:05:33,185 --> 01:05:36,845
Speaker 11:  few years or so, especially in some key markets like the US and they tried

1127
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:40,605
Speaker 11:  to merge with Honda late last year. That deal kind of fell apart,

1128
01:05:40,885 --> 01:05:43,645
Speaker 11:  although there's some rumblings that they might be trying to get back together

1129
01:05:43,655 --> 01:05:47,045
Speaker 11:  again. And then the, the, the leaf was supposed to be on the chopping block,

1130
01:05:47,045 --> 01:05:50,285
Speaker 11:  right? Like Nissan's got the aria, it's got some other EVs in the pipeline

1131
01:05:50,285 --> 01:05:53,285
Speaker 11:  that are a little bit more long range and a little bit more sort of like

1132
01:05:53,285 --> 01:05:57,205
Speaker 11:  in the form factor that consumers tend to like, which is more sort of like

1133
01:05:57,205 --> 01:06:01,085
Speaker 11:  in the SUV crossover air space. And now we're seeing the leaf is gonna become

1134
01:06:01,285 --> 01:06:05,045
Speaker 11:  a, a bit of a crossover as well. So yeah, I I would say let's,

1135
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:08,125
Speaker 11:  let's do that Nissan Leaf. Let's do it from a Nissan inside a Nissan Leaf.

1136
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:11,365
Speaker 11:  Let's record a whole podcast. I like that idea in a leaf and we can talk

1137
01:06:11,365 --> 01:06:15,125
Speaker 11:  about the whole history, which is, yeah, it's pretty fascinating. It's,

1138
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,685
Speaker 11:  it's been a roller coaster ride for the leaf.

1139
01:06:17,305 --> 01:06:20,965
Speaker 1:  Indeed. Yeah. If you get a real picture of this thing from all angles, I'm

1140
01:06:20,965 --> 01:06:23,725
Speaker 1:  gonna need you to send it to me because I keep looking at this like, kinda

1141
01:06:24,155 --> 01:06:27,405
Speaker 1:  like Robin's egg blue thing and I'm like, yeah, I would buy this car. I'm

1142
01:06:27,405 --> 01:06:28,805
Speaker 1:  ready. Let's do this. I'm down. Nice.

1143
01:06:28,995 --> 01:06:31,365
Speaker 11:  They got one customer already lined up. Yeah, there

1144
01:06:31,365 --> 01:06:34,085
Speaker 1:  We go. All right, Andy, thank you as always. Oh, my

1145
01:06:34,285 --> 01:06:34,805
Speaker 11:  Pleasure. Thanks David.

1146
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:39,405
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

1147
01:06:39,405 --> 01:06:41,765
Speaker 1:  take a question from The Vergecast hotline. We'll be right back

1148
01:08:17,545 --> 01:08:20,485
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's do a question from The Vergecast hotline as

1149
01:08:20,485 --> 01:08:23,965
Speaker 1:  always. The number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. You can email vergecast at The

1150
01:08:24,045 --> 01:08:27,845
Speaker 1:  Verge dot com. And by the way, It is always super delightful when you call

1151
01:08:27,845 --> 01:08:30,885
Speaker 1:  and have a question for a specific person because then I get to bother that

1152
01:08:31,165 --> 01:08:34,405
Speaker 1:  specific person and make them come do that with me, which is what happened.

1153
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:35,365
Speaker 1:  Today's your question.

1154
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:41,065
Speaker 18:  Hey, it's Peter from Brooklyn. This question's for Jen Tuy. Jen, I'm

1155
01:08:41,065 --> 01:08:44,985
Speaker 18:  wondering if there are any smart home companies that

1156
01:08:44,985 --> 01:08:48,945
Speaker 18:  are using AI with cameras to analyze what's going

1157
01:08:48,945 --> 01:08:52,745
Speaker 18:  on in your home. The example I keep thinking is if I could be

1158
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:56,705
Speaker 18:  like, Alexa, where did I leave the scissors? And it shows me a

1159
01:08:56,705 --> 01:09:00,305
Speaker 18:  little video of, oh yeah, last Thursday you put them in this drawer.

1160
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:05,285
Speaker 18:  Seems super creepy, but also super like something that

1161
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:09,405
Speaker 18:  they would do. Just curious if anybody's doing it. Thanks.

1162
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:13,665
Speaker 1:  You ask for Gen Tui, you get Gen Tui. Hi Gen Tui.

1163
01:09:14,075 --> 01:09:16,945
Speaker 17:  Hello. Happy to be here. Love to be summoned.

1164
01:09:18,345 --> 01:09:22,025
Speaker 1:  I just wanna say that super creepy and super useful should be the motto of

1165
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:22,505
Speaker 1:  the smart home.

1166
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:25,545
Speaker 17:  That is, that is true.

1167
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:30,065
Speaker 1:  So I, I had a couple of sort of immediate thoughts that this sparked, but

1168
01:09:30,085 --> 01:09:32,585
Speaker 1:  I'm curious where your head went here in this question.

1169
01:09:33,255 --> 01:09:36,825
Speaker 17:  Yeah, I guess the immediate answer is not yet.

1170
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:41,785
Speaker 17:  This is definitely where you can see them going

1171
01:09:42,085 --> 01:09:46,025
Speaker 17:  to some extent. Especially say you specifically mentioned Alexa and Amazon

1172
01:09:46,025 --> 01:09:49,465
Speaker 17:  with its new Alexa Plus and it's new multimodal

1173
01:09:49,465 --> 01:09:53,345
Speaker 17:  generative AI capabilities, you could see this happening.

1174
01:09:53,645 --> 01:09:57,225
Speaker 17:  In fact, at the Amazon event that they had in February,

1175
01:09:57,415 --> 01:10:01,265
Speaker 17:  they specifically used cameras to say, you could

1176
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:05,185
Speaker 17:  say to Alexa, when did my dog last go for a walk? And it, it

1177
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:09,145
Speaker 17:  looked through the footage and replied and, and showed an

1178
01:10:09,165 --> 01:10:12,545
Speaker 17:  an image of, or a video of the last time someone had taken the dog out for

1179
01:10:12,545 --> 01:10:16,225
Speaker 17:  a walk. I think for this type of very fine grained

1180
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:20,065
Speaker 17:  things like where did I leave the scissors? Mm, that's gonna

1181
01:10:20,065 --> 01:10:23,945
Speaker 17:  be a bit more of a challenge for Alexa in the current capabilities. Unless

1182
01:10:23,945 --> 01:10:27,465
Speaker 17:  you have ring cameras stationed everywhere around your house

1183
01:10:27,495 --> 01:10:30,945
Speaker 17:  capturing every movement, it definitely wouldn't have the capability yet.

1184
01:10:30,945 --> 01:10:34,105
Speaker 17:  Because another thing that a lot of these, so there are a number of security

1185
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:37,865
Speaker 17:  cameras that are doing this AI search feature where

1186
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:41,825
Speaker 17:  you can search through your camera history just with typing some phrases,

1187
01:10:42,365 --> 01:10:46,345
Speaker 17:  but they are very much trained on specific things that you might like to

1188
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:50,305
Speaker 17:  look for. So I think, you know, scissors in a drawer might be the level

1189
01:10:50,595 --> 01:10:54,585
Speaker 17:  above what they're at now. It's more like cat on the porch or

1190
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:58,625
Speaker 17:  delivery driver approaching door kind of things that they're doing now.

1191
01:10:58,765 --> 01:11:02,505
Speaker 17:  So Ring has that AI search feature. Google

1192
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:05,425
Speaker 17:  Nest is launching it, it's currently in like a beta program.

1193
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,465
Speaker 17:  Arlo actually has an interesting one where you can program your

1194
01:11:10,605 --> 01:11:13,765
Speaker 17:  own search query. So you could sort of say,

1195
01:11:15,085 --> 01:11:18,805
Speaker 17:  I guess you could set up a camera, an Arlo camera in your living room and,

1196
01:11:18,865 --> 01:11:22,445
Speaker 17:  and train it to watch your, where you put the scissors.

1197
01:11:23,025 --> 01:11:26,765
Speaker 17:  But again, it would have to be very specific. You'd have to know what you

1198
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:29,845
Speaker 17:  would want it to look for. It's not gonna be able to sort of analyze everything

1199
01:11:29,845 --> 01:11:33,525
Speaker 17:  you've seen it's seen and look for it that

1200
01:11:33,805 --> 01:11:37,365
Speaker 17:  specific yet. But I can see it going there. I think, I'm guessing where

1201
01:11:37,365 --> 01:11:41,085
Speaker 17:  you are going David is would be where I would go with this, is it's more

1202
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:44,885
Speaker 17:  likely to come from AI glasses. Yep.

1203
01:11:45,035 --> 01:11:47,525
Speaker 17:  Like we saw Google demo. This, this is,

1204
01:11:47,585 --> 01:11:51,485
Speaker 1:  So this is exactly where my head went is the, that it's called Project Astro,

1205
01:11:51,485 --> 01:11:54,885
Speaker 1:  that's it from Google and It is, it's the the demo.

1206
01:11:54,995 --> 01:11:57,925
Speaker 1:  Exactly. Was that right? Yeah, they, they were just walking around and they

1207
01:11:57,925 --> 01:12:00,925
Speaker 1:  had this sort of always on camera and they were like, oh, where did I leave

1208
01:12:00,925 --> 01:12:03,605
Speaker 1:  my glasses? And it, it directed them back there to where they left their

1209
01:12:03,605 --> 01:12:07,205
Speaker 1:  glasses. Notably not shipping, I could say that feature.

1210
01:12:07,395 --> 01:12:11,285
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's starting to like percolate out in the world. It, it seems to

1211
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:15,125
Speaker 1:  be a real thing, but It is not, It is not nearly yet what Google showed it

1212
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:18,845
Speaker 1:  to be, but yeah, that, that is, like you said, that is the thing everybody

1213
01:12:18,845 --> 01:12:22,165
Speaker 1:  is working on. Yeah. This idea of like, how do I give

1214
01:12:22,585 --> 01:12:26,005
Speaker 1:  myself some sort of consistent awareness of my surroundings

1215
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:30,045
Speaker 1:  and then use that to help me, which is a really

1216
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:33,565
Speaker 1:  interesting problem, but a really hard one. And it does seem like

1217
01:12:34,145 --> 01:12:38,085
Speaker 1:  if your, if your bar is not scissors, but It is like, I

1218
01:12:38,085 --> 01:12:40,725
Speaker 1:  don't know on the level of like people and pets, right? I, I think about

1219
01:12:40,745 --> 01:12:43,885
Speaker 1:  the, the smart home stuff as like, it, it's comings and goings. I, I sort

1220
01:12:43,885 --> 01:12:47,805
Speaker 1:  of want to know when major events with people and pets are happening in

1221
01:12:47,805 --> 01:12:51,085
Speaker 1:  my house that it seems like these tools are actually getting pretty good

1222
01:12:51,085 --> 01:12:54,725
Speaker 1:  at pretty fast, right? Yeah. Like in, in theory the, the tech is there and

1223
01:12:54,725 --> 01:12:58,645
Speaker 1:  it seems like the distance between people and pets and scissors is just

1224
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:01,565
Speaker 1:  like time and camera quality to some extent. Yeah.

1225
01:13:01,565 --> 01:13:05,445
Speaker 17:  Just training the machine learning models on what It is that you want

1226
01:13:05,705 --> 01:13:09,485
Speaker 17:  to be identified about or told about. And I think, yeah, right

1227
01:13:09,545 --> 01:13:13,445
Speaker 17:  now, because there is the creepy factor with cameras, a

1228
01:13:13,445 --> 01:13:17,205
Speaker 17:  lot of this is focused on what's happening outside your home. Not so much

1229
01:13:17,385 --> 01:13:21,125
Speaker 17:  inside but with, I mean if you have cameras inside your home

1230
01:13:21,425 --> 01:13:25,125
Speaker 17:  and you want to identify specific people or specific events,

1231
01:13:25,865 --> 01:13:29,525
Speaker 17:  you can do that right now. You, the ring video

1232
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:33,485
Speaker 17:  AI search feature, which I wrote about, I used it to track, keep track of

1233
01:13:33,485 --> 01:13:36,605
Speaker 17:  my cat. Like I would keep losing my cat and I would just type in, you know,

1234
01:13:37,265 --> 01:13:41,245
Speaker 17:  cat gray today and it would show me all the videos

1235
01:13:41,395 --> 01:13:44,845
Speaker 17:  that it had captured of my cat walking around the various parts.

1236
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:47,525
Speaker 1:  Your cat just slipping in and out of the wall. Yeah.

1237
01:13:48,405 --> 01:13:51,645
Speaker 17:  Although mainly outdoors. 'cause I, I don't really do cameras inside, but

1238
01:13:51,675 --> 01:13:55,525
Speaker 17:  echo devices have cameras on them. So like the show devices all have cameras

1239
01:13:55,585 --> 01:13:59,565
Speaker 17:  on them. So you could see this becoming part of

1240
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:03,205
Speaker 17:  what they offer right now though it's just ring cameras, so those

1241
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:06,725
Speaker 17:  aren't the cameras in the show. Devices nests,

1242
01:14:06,955 --> 01:14:10,605
Speaker 17:  same thing. They have indoor and outdoor cameras and also their Nest hubs.

1243
01:14:10,925 --> 01:14:14,405
Speaker 17:  A a few of them have cameras. So yes, I could definitely see this being

1244
01:14:14,405 --> 01:14:17,845
Speaker 17:  where they're going. And it's one of the really useful areas of AI that

1245
01:14:17,845 --> 01:14:21,685
Speaker 17:  I've, of generative ai I've seen in the smart home to date, getting that

1246
01:14:21,685 --> 01:14:25,205
Speaker 17:  kind of fine-grained detail about what's happened in your home without you

1247
01:14:25,205 --> 01:14:28,965
Speaker 17:  having to scroll through every video and look for Right. Or Yeah,

1248
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:33,285
Speaker 17:  try and 'cause right to date you've had things like person, animal,

1249
01:14:33,285 --> 01:14:36,965
Speaker 17:  vehicle, so you can filter your video clips to just animal, but then

1250
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:39,565
Speaker 17:  I'd be looking through, if I was looking for my cat, I'm looking through

1251
01:14:39,565 --> 01:14:43,405
Speaker 17:  videos of like squirrels and my dog going round in circles and not finding

1252
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:47,325
Speaker 17:  the cat. Whereas now I can just ask it to find me cat and

1253
01:14:47,945 --> 01:14:49,205
Speaker 17:  it finds me cat sometimes

1254
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:53,845
Speaker 1:  It finds me cat is pretty good. Yeah, I, I was thinking about this today

1255
01:14:54,045 --> 01:14:57,925
Speaker 1:  actually. I, my neighbor had to be out for the day,

1256
01:14:57,985 --> 01:15:01,965
Speaker 1:  but It is having luggage delivered like the, the airline lost her luggage

1257
01:15:02,365 --> 01:15:04,485
Speaker 1:  and so they're delivering it. And so she called me this morning, I was like,

1258
01:15:04,485 --> 01:15:08,445
Speaker 1:  Hey, can you be around in case they need to deliver the luggage? And

1259
01:15:08,785 --> 01:15:12,485
Speaker 1:  now I'm like glued to my house in case they come and knock on the door

1260
01:15:12,905 --> 01:15:15,405
Speaker 1:  and, and I had to leave for a few minutes and I was actually thinking like,

1261
01:15:15,405 --> 01:15:18,365
Speaker 1:  oh, being able to come back and be like, Hey, did, did the mailman come?

1262
01:15:18,365 --> 01:15:21,925
Speaker 1:  Like, did, did the Alaska Airlines people come is like genuinely,

1263
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:25,765
Speaker 1:  sincerely useful. Yeah. In a way that I don't have that much smart

1264
01:15:25,765 --> 01:15:28,525
Speaker 1:  home stuff, but that was one of the moments where I was like, oh, I wish

1265
01:15:28,605 --> 01:15:32,485
Speaker 1:  I had that. I just rely on like my dog to bark and tell me that

1266
01:15:32,485 --> 01:15:35,605
Speaker 1:  there are people at the door and that's not, it turns out a, a perfect system.

1267
01:15:36,555 --> 01:15:39,885
Speaker 17:  Well the downsides of this type of feature is you are going to have to pay

1268
01:15:39,885 --> 01:15:43,325
Speaker 17:  for it. All of these services are included in like the ring

1269
01:15:43,645 --> 01:15:47,165
Speaker 17:  subscriptions, the Nest subscriptions. But interestingly enough, a couple

1270
01:15:47,465 --> 01:15:50,885
Speaker 17:  months ago a new company launched called Seymour ai,

1271
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:55,125
Speaker 17:  which is S-E-E-M-O-U-R and It is able to

1272
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:58,805
Speaker 17:  go through all my ring footage and let me search for it even if I'm not

1273
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:01,765
Speaker 17:  paying for subscription. So, oh, interesting. If you wanna just try it out.

1274
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:05,285
Speaker 17:  This is, that's a good way to to, to start at least

1275
01:16:06,005 --> 01:16:07,205
Speaker 17:  I don't know how they're doing it

1276
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:11,925
Speaker 17:  and I'm sure ring's aware of it and I'm sure they'll probably charge at

1277
01:16:11,925 --> 01:16:15,325
Speaker 17:  some point, but right now you can download the app for free on iOS and if

1278
01:16:15,325 --> 01:16:18,485
Speaker 17:  you have ring cameras you can, it will search through your footage for you.

1279
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:23,005
Speaker 17:  But again, it's very specific, like it tells me a lot that it's seen

1280
01:16:23,565 --> 01:16:27,405
Speaker 17:  destructive pet activity on my porch, which is normally just

1281
01:16:27,405 --> 01:16:30,845
Speaker 17:  my dog walking around. Sure. So like, again, they're trained to look for

1282
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:34,085
Speaker 17:  specific things they think you might be interested in, but as you say, as

1283
01:16:34,085 --> 01:16:37,965
Speaker 17:  this advances, I think that gap between, you know, dog

1284
01:16:38,225 --> 01:16:41,845
Speaker 17:  cat destructive activity and this is where you left your

1285
01:16:41,925 --> 01:16:45,605
Speaker 17:  scissors may, may start to get a lot smaller and, and it could be very

1286
01:16:45,605 --> 01:16:47,965
Speaker 17:  useful if you don't mind having cameras in your house.

1287
01:16:48,435 --> 01:16:51,885
Speaker 1:  Well, so that's what I was gonna say is it seems like to me the two roadblocks

1288
01:16:51,885 --> 01:16:55,765
Speaker 1:  here are a, It is a huge technological leap, right? To

1289
01:16:55,765 --> 01:16:59,605
Speaker 1:  go from I know what a dog looks like to all

1290
01:16:59,605 --> 01:17:03,285
Speaker 1:  the things going on inside of your house Yeah. Is a huge

1291
01:17:03,395 --> 01:17:06,805
Speaker 1:  leap. Yeah. It's, and like we've seen how hard that is. But then the other

1292
01:17:06,805 --> 01:17:10,795
Speaker 1:  thing is, I, I just can't fathom the number of cameras you'd have to

1293
01:17:10,795 --> 01:17:13,955
Speaker 1:  have in your house in order to be able to pull that off. It seems like you

1294
01:17:13,955 --> 01:17:17,875
Speaker 1:  would need a camera or, or ideally a couple of

1295
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:21,595
Speaker 1:  cameras essentially on every single square

1296
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:24,715
Speaker 1:  inch of your entire house in order for this system to work. Because even

1297
01:17:24,715 --> 01:17:27,235
Speaker 1:  if you have a couple of blind spots, the whole thing kind of falls apart.

1298
01:17:27,295 --> 01:17:31,275
Speaker 1:  So I'm like, is this why everyone gets that ring drone camera that can

1299
01:17:31,275 --> 01:17:33,835
Speaker 1:  follow them around because it solves this problem? I

1300
01:17:33,835 --> 01:17:36,955
Speaker 17:  Don't know. I did think about that. Yeah. Okay. But that's only designed

1301
01:17:36,955 --> 01:17:38,995
Speaker 17:  to work when you're not in the house, so

1302
01:17:39,585 --> 01:17:40,235
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that'll

1303
01:17:40,235 --> 01:17:44,115
Speaker 17:  Change. And also never shipped. Yeah. Unlikely

1304
01:17:44,135 --> 01:17:48,115
Speaker 17:  to ship at any time in the future if you ask me. So yes,

1305
01:17:48,115 --> 01:17:51,755
Speaker 17:  the ring camera, the flying drone is, is designed to work

1306
01:17:51,905 --> 01:17:55,835
Speaker 17:  when you're not there. So it might not be as useful. I think Amazon would

1307
01:17:55,835 --> 01:17:59,555
Speaker 17:  like us to have screens with cameras in every corner of our room, but I

1308
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:03,475
Speaker 17:  think sure would, yeah. Ultimately the idea of smart glasses

1309
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:07,515
Speaker 17:  or I mean as as Apple recently, or it's leaked

1310
01:18:07,715 --> 01:18:10,755
Speaker 17:  recently that Apple might be putting cameras in your watch,

1311
01:18:11,665 --> 01:18:15,315
Speaker 17:  more cameras may be on you because again, that's less,

1312
01:18:15,535 --> 01:18:18,395
Speaker 17:  that's, there's still a bit of invasion of privacy. But something I talk

1313
01:18:18,395 --> 01:18:22,115
Speaker 17:  about a lot in the smart home is, it's one thing when you have the cost

1314
01:18:22,555 --> 01:18:26,155
Speaker 17:  convenience ratio that you are weighing when you are using technology, you

1315
01:18:26,155 --> 01:18:30,115
Speaker 17:  know, a smartphone or a smartwatch or using Gmail or, and you

1316
01:18:30,115 --> 01:18:33,795
Speaker 17:  are willing to give up some privacy for the features that you get, but it's

1317
01:18:33,795 --> 01:18:37,355
Speaker 17:  another when you're in your home and there are other people in the home

1318
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:40,795
Speaker 17:  and you're giving up their privacy as well. So there's a lot more

1319
01:18:41,505 --> 01:18:45,355
Speaker 17:  cost of benefit ratio that has to be factored in there for everyone in the

1320
01:18:45,355 --> 01:18:49,035
Speaker 17:  home, not just yourself. So assuming everyone's on board with having cameras

1321
01:18:49,135 --> 01:18:53,035
Speaker 17:  in your home, you might be okay, but I think that's unlikely. So I

1322
01:18:53,035 --> 01:18:56,955
Speaker 17:  think personal devices are much more likely to get us to that

1323
01:18:57,315 --> 01:19:01,035
Speaker 17:  position that our callers interested in, especially if

1324
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:04,755
Speaker 17:  it's you who's left the scissors somewhere. Although in my household, everyone

1325
01:19:04,755 --> 01:19:08,555
Speaker 17:  always steals my scissors, so I would need cameras on everyone. I got a

1326
01:19:08,555 --> 01:19:12,195
Speaker 17:  pack of five scissors for Christmas because I complain so often about how

1327
01:19:12,195 --> 01:19:16,115
Speaker 17:  many people, everyone's stealing my scissors. So I, I'm with him on

1328
01:19:16,115 --> 01:19:18,115
Speaker 17:  this. I would like to know where my scissors are.

1329
01:19:18,735 --> 01:19:21,515
Speaker 1:  How many of the five pairs do you still have? It's now the end of March.

1330
01:19:21,535 --> 01:19:22,595
Speaker 1:  Do we still have all five? No,

1331
01:19:22,635 --> 01:19:23,595
Speaker 17:  I have half of one.

1332
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:29,115
Speaker 17:  I don't know where the rest are. All

1333
01:19:29,115 --> 01:19:31,915
Speaker 1:  Right. So we need somebody to invent this quickly. If you could get this

1334
01:19:31,915 --> 01:19:35,755
Speaker 1:  done for us and for Peter, this would be amazing. Yes. All right Jen, thank
