00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,790
Speaker 1:  This week on the webcast Alex seat, during the show, we talk about his interview

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,600
Speaker 1:  with Ken or using Kerrianne Moss. What else is going on in the metaverse

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,720
Speaker 1:  a bunch of streaming news and then the lightning round to end a lightning

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,610
Speaker 1:  round. So it's coming up on the webcast. Now,

6
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,280
Speaker 1:  Hello. Welcome to Vergecast the flagship podcast of

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,060
Speaker 1:  reality. See, you got to sit in that for a

8
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,330
Speaker 1:  minute. Yeah, really just pull the car over

9
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,630
Speaker 1:  now and just thinking about what the flagship podcasts of reality would

10
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,390
Speaker 1:  be. And it's this. That's what I listen to. Then you can keep growing. Hi,

11
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,960
Speaker 1:  I'm Neil I'm your friend Deidre brown is here. I'm the glitch in the matrix.

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,060
Speaker 1:  Ooh, that's good, Alex.

13
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,570
Speaker 3:  I am a cyber punk mod.

14
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,810
Speaker 1:  Okay, good. You'll understand why that's funny. And a little bit, Heath is

15
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,210
Speaker 1:  going to be with us for the whole show. There's lots of talk about you, but

16
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,780
Speaker 1:  we will, we'll just start with, you know, one of the more exciting things

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,590
Speaker 1:  that has happened@theoldverge.com in our 10

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,920
Speaker 1:  years of running around, you hung out with counter Reeves and carry on last

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,460
Speaker 1:  this week.

20
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,180
Speaker 3:  Yeah. We talked about a lot of things. It was a very

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,990
Speaker 3:  interesting interview. And the reason that we talk to

22
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,770
Speaker 3:  them is because they are doing this new interactive

23
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,490
Speaker 3:  playable tech demo by epic games showing off

24
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,420
Speaker 3:  unreal engine five. And it's a tie in with kind of teasing the

25
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,140
Speaker 3:  next matrix movie, which comes out later this month. So we talked about all

26
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,070
Speaker 3:  that kind of, what is real, what is fake, the kind of blending of

27
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,610
Speaker 3:  the virtual and the real and how that's changing storytelling.

28
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,090
Speaker 3:  And a lot of other random things Kiana was very

29
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,560
Speaker 3:  classic.

30
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,410
Speaker 1:  You mean the video's up by the time you're listening to this, it's up. You

31
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,920
Speaker 1:  should go watch it. It is very much like a key on a Reeves

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,700
Speaker 1:  experience. Carry on loss is great too. Like, she's great, but

33
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,690
Speaker 1:  like, Kiano like literally you can just see him, like

34
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,320
Speaker 1:  he lights up over time. It's it's, it's just very, the whole thing

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,250
Speaker 1:  is very, at one point he was like, we do this so that we can sell

36
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,250
Speaker 1:  things. I mean, make art, I mean, sell things and he just starts

37
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,240
Speaker 1:  grinning. Like it's

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Speaker 1:  very cool.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,010
Speaker 3:  And the hand gestures are wonderful as well. And yeah, Carrie Ann Moss, not

40
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,860
Speaker 3:  really a fan of technology at all, even a all, which was

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,850
Speaker 3:  interesting. But yeah, we talked about kind of digital likeness, you know,

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,780
Speaker 3:  Kiana was one of the first actors ever. I found out in the process of doing

43
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,680
Speaker 3:  this to be, have to have himself digitally rendered

44
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,400
Speaker 3:  in the original matrix trilogy. And so Warner bros actually found that

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,390
Speaker 3:  footage in like a vault buried in the ground and like Idaho or

46
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,170
Speaker 3:  something like that and gave it to epic and epic re

47
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,920
Speaker 3:  rendered it with Youi for this matrix demo. And

48
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,850
Speaker 3:  it's, it is fairly trippy. There's a couple of times where they told me

49
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,270
Speaker 3:  after, like, when it's real him versus fake him. And it, it actually, it

50
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,110
Speaker 3:  got me like at least once and yeah, the, the intro to

51
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,440
Speaker 3:  this as written by Llano Chomsky, the main writer of the matrix

52
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,920
Speaker 3:  franchise, and then it's kind of an open world sandbox

53
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,640
Speaker 3:  experience that kind of showcases how Youi

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,300
Speaker 3:  five is basically just super scaling the ability to make like

55
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,960
Speaker 3:  actual metaverse stuff. So, yeah, it was, it was really

56
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,650
Speaker 3:  interesting.

57
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,890
Speaker 4:  And Canada was like, I'm almost ready to have a coherent thought about like

58
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,790
Speaker 4:  the nature of reality and unreality and how that interacts with

59
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,330
Speaker 4:  video games and cinema. I'm like, I'm like, I'm working my way towards it

60
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,900
Speaker 4:  and carry on Moss was like, yeah, no reality is cool. Everything. Like, why

61
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,870
Speaker 4:  would you, like, how about reality? How about I'm sitting at a table with

62
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,100
Speaker 4:  my family and he's like, it, it could be a virtual table. She's like, yeah,

63
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,460
Speaker 4:  but, but what about the real table? It was great.

64
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,820
Speaker 3:  Actually the most shocking takeaway from this counter

65
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,510
Speaker 3:  Reeves does not play video games. I thought that was really interesting

66
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,050
Speaker 3:  vegans. I

67
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,950
Speaker 1:  Can see that.

68
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,940
Speaker 3:  Well, he's, he's a character on cyberpunk. And I did ask him

69
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,510
Speaker 3:  about, you know, in cyberpunk 2077, we covered this when this was

70
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,500
Speaker 3:  happening, people were modding. One of the characters that you have

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,280
Speaker 3:  sex with in the game to be Canada Reeve's character. And it got

72
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,090
Speaker 3:  so bad that the game developer actually said, you can't do this. If we

73
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,840
Speaker 3:  find out you're doing this, we will ban your account. And I asked Keanu

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,170
Speaker 3:  about it and he loved it. He was like, you know, that's he was like, hell

75
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,710
Speaker 3:  yeah. And clearly was not

76
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,370
Speaker 3:  consulted on that decision. Another thing that I think fans of the

77
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,970
Speaker 3:  matrix will love is that counter really wants there to be a modern day

78
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,960
Speaker 3:  matrix video game. And basically told me point blank that Warner

79
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,890
Speaker 3:  bros dropped the ball 15 years ago and he would do

80
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,360
Speaker 3:  it. So there you go.

81
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,110
Speaker 1:  Well, the matrix franchise is, I don't know. I, I think I

82
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,530
Speaker 1:  watched it like my first week of college in 1999, it was like a field trip

83
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,860
Speaker 1:  that like my dorm took, you know, like it was just like one of those

84
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,820
Speaker 1:  eye-opening moments. I hadn't really heard about it. And then it was

85
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,720
Speaker 1:  like twisted and turned itself into all manner of things

86
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,680
Speaker 1:  in memes. So it's wild that they actually never made. The

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,370
Speaker 1:  game is like the rest of the tech and

88
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,270
Speaker 1:  gaming industry has done nothing, but try to make the matrix.

89
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,050
Speaker 1:  Yep, Nope.

90
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,980
Speaker 3:  They did make a game. They made two and there was only one where

91
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,310
Speaker 3:  you could play Neo. It was called path of Neo. It was on the chest

92
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,880
Speaker 3:  too. It was actually pretty good. The

93
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,220
Speaker 3:  gameplay was like, I watched some YouTube videos of it. It looks fun for

94
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,180
Speaker 3:  a PSU game and they could just remake that they could just like,

95
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,540
Speaker 3:  literally just do like, you're fighting as Neo as a game. Like you don't

96
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,280
Speaker 3:  even need to really do a story.

97
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Speaker 1:  They would do it. And you would end up, you would end up in that dojo with

98
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,210
Speaker 1:  Morpheus and you would have to either grind for 60 hours to

99
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,570
Speaker 1:  level up two points or like pay micro

100
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,410
Speaker 1:  transaction fees to get a loot box that one of them would

101
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,400
Speaker 1:  maybe have Kung Fu in it, like, you know exactly how that game would be designed

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,080
Speaker 1:  now. Yeah. That's

103
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,620
Speaker 3:  Another highlight of this interview. Keanu seems very interested in being

104
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,370
Speaker 3:  the chief creative officer of a VR porn tech company.

105
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,360
Speaker 3:  So if you are listening to this show and that's what you

106
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,880
Speaker 3:  do, you should definitely reach out to his team. It's like, you don't

107
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,940
Speaker 1:  Want to admit who the audience of your show is. And sometimes you just know

108
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,690
Speaker 3:  It's like the Venn diagram, you know, it's like extremely verge

109
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,380
Speaker 3:  shitted in one corner, Keanu, Reeves, VR porn, and then it all just kind

110
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,420
Speaker 3:  of meets in the middle because

111
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,240
Speaker 1:  He has to see any of the movie at all. Do they preview the

112
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,750
Speaker 3:  Movie? No, I just, I've only seen the trailers. They were very cagey about

113
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,590
Speaker 3:  it. Something surprising Carrie Ann said is that it's funny, which I

114
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,060
Speaker 3:  wouldn't expect from a matrix movie, but, well, the first

115
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,760
Speaker 1:  Action movie was kind of

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,510
Speaker 3:  Funny, I guess it had funny moments, but I think the tone of this is going

117
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,990
Speaker 3:  to be a lot more funny than the, than the previous ones.

118
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,620
Speaker 3:  Okay.

119
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,550
Speaker 1:  I could see, I mean the whole like red pill, like cultural

120
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,390
Speaker 1:  association is such that I know what you sisters like want to break

121
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,900
Speaker 1:  it. Yeah. Because it is now associated with the alt-right and all that. Like

122
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,440
Speaker 1:  I get why they'd want to change the tone about red pill blue. We'll

123
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,400
Speaker 1:  see, I'm excited to see this movie, but I'm burnt on the previous two.

124
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,240
Speaker 1:  Like yeah. We're so disappointed. Anyhow is

125
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,230
Speaker 1:  the unreal stuff better than Gemini man. The movie in which will Smith

126
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,340
Speaker 1:  was famously.

127
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,150
Speaker 3:  Oh my God. Yeah. I mean, as a story

128
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,140
Speaker 3:  objective. Yes. But like literally anything

129
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,440
Speaker 3:  the tech is, I think the thing that impressed me the most is that, so you're

130
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,160
Speaker 3:  in this giant kind of sandbox city that they built, that they're going to

131
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,640
Speaker 3:  give to unreal developers to build like their own grand theft auto in, for

132
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,150
Speaker 3:  example, and everything is rendered in real

133
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,780
Speaker 3:  time, everywhere persistently. So like

134
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,290
Speaker 3:  anywhere you move, it's already there. It's already rendered down to the

135
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,160
Speaker 3:  detail and like a chain link fence. So like we flew up and then we shot down

136
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,040
Speaker 3:  into an Allan. He was like that didn't render as we moved down there that

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,430
Speaker 3:  was already there in full detail. And I've never seen that at that scale

138
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,760
Speaker 3:  in a game. So it's showing just kind of the power of the world building there.

139
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,300
Speaker 3:  And then also the ability for this is a little more geeky, but the

140
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,930
Speaker 3:  lighting is actually pretty cool. You don't need to know really

141
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,020
Speaker 3:  apparently placing lights in games as a super expensive tedious

142
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,010
Speaker 3:  process that really hinders the ability for it to look real and a big

143
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,610
Speaker 3:  breakthrough in <em></em> is this kind of automatically AI

144
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,570
Speaker 3:  powered lighting system that reflects naturally. And like, you

145
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,020
Speaker 3:  can, you can change the sunlight, you know, with a dial in the game as you

146
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,800
Speaker 3:  play and watch all the reflections against the skyscrapers change. I think

147
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,680
Speaker 3:  it's the cars and it's pretty cool, honestly. I mean, it's the idea

148
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,220
Speaker 3:  is that you'll be able to take, like, you know, a car maker will make a car

149
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,970
Speaker 3:  for a work, you know, simulation thing and , and that

150
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,810
Speaker 3:  same hyper-realistic looking car could then be used in a racing

151
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,470
Speaker 3:  game. It could then be used in the next fast and furious movie all as the

152
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,190
Speaker 3:  same asset in , which has signed well, it hasn't existed before.

153
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,030
Speaker 1:  That's really cool. I've been playing the grand theft auto remasters, which

154
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,120
Speaker 1:  are very fun. And I was like reading about them and how they did them. And

155
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,660
Speaker 1:  they, one of the biggest pieces of that puzzle was

156
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,320
Speaker 1:  lighting. So the original, they were just lit like the game

157
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,110
Speaker 1:  designers, like the scenes were just lit, like it made no sense where the

158
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,470
Speaker 1:  lights are coming from. We didn't have the technology, we updated the

159
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,430
Speaker 1:  lighting design and we try to naturally light the game. And we

160
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,790
Speaker 1:  had to go through and like add streetlights to

161
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,600
Speaker 1:  places because there wasn't, they made no sense where the light was coming

162
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,720
Speaker 1:  from before. And that was like, the work of remastering. This game was just

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,170
Speaker 1:  re rejiggering all the lighting, that all that stuff is

164
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,070
Speaker 1:  like the confluence of game engines,

165
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,030
Speaker 1:  movie special effects. And then the metaverse stuff. It does feel

166
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,000
Speaker 1:  like it will all just kind of be the same software at the end.

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,870
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And it's, this is honestly like epic is the perfect company to, to

168
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,360
Speaker 3:  make all this because their CTO, Kim, who I also interviewed for the

169
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,250
Speaker 3:  story worked on the original matrix trilogy. He has a film background and

170
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,000
Speaker 3:  he did all the, he was an effects supervisor on kind of bullet time and like

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,420
Speaker 3:  all new kind of iconic matrix stuff and knows the Chelsea's, that's kind

172
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,410
Speaker 3:  of how this whole project came together. And he was talking a

173
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,170
Speaker 3:  lot about how he thinks it's going to change Hollywood and epic has already.

174
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,160
Speaker 3:  So like in the Mandalorian, in camera visual effects where there's a

175
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,730
Speaker 3:  giant led wall behind you, instead of CGI and post with a green

176
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,360
Speaker 3:  screen, that's being powered by unreal. And that

177
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,260
Speaker 3:  technology he thinks is going to really just change how Hollywood runs or

178
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,130
Speaker 3:  I think he hopes it will. So, yeah, they're a very interesting company. Unreal

179
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,000
Speaker 3:  is like this really fascinating, powerful thing that touches a lot of

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,930
Speaker 3:  things, but consumers don't really see. So it's a little wonky, but I mean,

181
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,770
Speaker 3:  if you're talking about like, metaverse like, this is actually like the toolkit,

182
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,520
Speaker 3:  right? This is actually the thing like Metta, the company does not have

183
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,280
Speaker 3:  anything remotely like this. I just, so I think it's interesting.

184
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,120
Speaker 1:  Did we, do we, I don't know if we talked about this last week, unity, the

185
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,930
Speaker 1:  other big game studio just bought what a digital, which was

186
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,770
Speaker 1:  Peter Jackson's special effects house for $1.6

187
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,610
Speaker 1:  billion. And like that's Lord of the rings and avatar and

188
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,600
Speaker 1:  Shang sheet. Like you can just see where it's going, that the, the game

189
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,060
Speaker 1:  engines are now getting good enough to do the special effects

190
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,740
Speaker 1:  everywhere.

191
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,160
Speaker 3:  And that's why there was a story about epic hiring a head

192
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,030
Speaker 3:  of film and like scripted entertainment. And I kind of got at this

193
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,690
Speaker 3:  with the CTO that they're going to start doing games that are also

194
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,570
Speaker 3:  movies using Fortnite using other things, because <em></em>

195
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,430
Speaker 3:  allows them to just use these assets across mediums, which it's pretty cool.

196
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,390
Speaker 3:  It's a, it's a new thing for

197
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,940
Speaker 1:  Sure. Now I feel like a genius for telling people to watch red versus blue.

198
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,570
Speaker 1:  When I was looking through the early two thousands, right? This, this is

199
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,960
Speaker 1:  dumb sitcom that takes place in halo is the future of

200
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,200
Speaker 1:  entertainment. I said to no effect at the

201
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,800
Speaker 1:  bar, but I was right. It always comes out.

202
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,730
Speaker 4:  I'm just excited that all of this means that within the next,

203
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,030
Speaker 4:  well, let's be, let's be realistic within the next 10 years. We'll get rid

204
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,910
Speaker 4:  of quick time events that are just, you know, pre-rendered cut scenes where

205
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,770
Speaker 4:  you hit the button at the right time.

206
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,490
Speaker 3:  I didn't know this, but apparently all the Fortnite commercials are shot

207
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,330
Speaker 3:  in fortnight, like in real time. And so like, they're already doing

208
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,600
Speaker 3:  this. He's like, we just stage it in the game and we shoot it. And like,

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Speaker 3:  we may like touch up things and make the characters look a little shiny or,

210
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,870
Speaker 3:  but like, they're already doing this. And like part of this matrix thing

211
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,510
Speaker 3:  is like, there's a car chase scene where the camera's like going under the

212
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,170
Speaker 3:  car and around the car. And like, that was all done in the engine. Right.

213
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,990
Speaker 3:  They didn't like have cars out on the street that they then tracked and brought

214
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,680
Speaker 3:  into . So it's, we're getting into a weird uncharted

215
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,460
Speaker 3:  territory.

216
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,280
Speaker 1:  So one of the reasons I asked about Gemini man, which is so

217
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,260
Speaker 1:  horrible,

218
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,890
Speaker 4:  It's not even an

219
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,700
Speaker 1:  Airplane movie. It's like, it's not even an F it's like, unwatchably bad.

220
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,250
Speaker 1:  Yeah. There are these really

221
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,730
Speaker 1:  hilarious, like YouTube clips where

222
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,030
Speaker 1:  people, I think Gemini man was actually like shot in

223
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,630
Speaker 1:  120 frames per second. And we're like released that way. But there are these

224
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,560
Speaker 1:  YouTube channels that like oppressed things into higher frame rates.

225
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,460
Speaker 1:  So you can go watch Gemini man at like 120 frames per

226
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,090
Speaker 1:  second on YouTube. And it looks, I mean, it looks like a bad video game.

227
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,720
Speaker 1:  It's like, there's no way to describe it. Just go watch it. It's like horrifying,

228
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,960
Speaker 1:  but a big piece of that puzzle that the big piece, that story of that movie

229
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,890
Speaker 1:  came out was there is now a model of young will Smith and like

230
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,040
Speaker 1:  who was going to own the digital character model of young will

231
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,850
Speaker 1:  Smith and what could that model be made to do and

232
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,630
Speaker 1:  who owned it? And like if the young will Smith model

233
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,590
Speaker 1:  acts in the new movie, will Smith get paid? Did you get into any of

234
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,150
Speaker 1:  that with, with Kiana? And

235
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,140
Speaker 3:  Yes, we did. And apparently Keanu saw this coming

236
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,680
Speaker 3:  like decades ago and has for ever had in his

237
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,370
Speaker 3:  contract where he has to approve any use or edits to his digital

238
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,360
Speaker 3:  likeness in any format. And he's like, this is happening.

239
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,750
Speaker 3:  Like we're having these conversations in Hollywood about like, it's almost

240
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,090
Speaker 3:  like estate planning is like, what are you going to do with your digital

241
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,050
Speaker 3:  likeness? And he's like in like Marilyn, Monroe's in a Coke commercial. And

242
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,620
Speaker 3:  you know, he was talking about how Marlon Brando's with Superman was talking

243
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,250
Speaker 3:  about this already, like decades ago. And so, yeah,

244
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,670
Speaker 3:  I, I do think it's something that's like on celebrity's

245
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,390
Speaker 3:  minds is like, how do I license my likeness?

246
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,320
Speaker 3:  And you know, like I asked him, so the matrix did this NFT thing for the

247
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,890
Speaker 3:  new movie and at the site like crashed after the first like

248
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,580
Speaker 3:  hour. And there were 300,000 people in the queue for like a hundred thousand

249
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,540
Speaker 3:  in FTS, at 50 bucks, a pop and Kiana and Kerianne were not in

250
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,470
Speaker 3:  FTS for that side. They obviously did not approve the use of them. But yeah,

251
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,540
Speaker 3:  they thought that was interesting. And Canada was like, do we get a cut of

252
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,470
Speaker 3:  that? I was like, oh, probably, probably not. But he was like, it's all

253
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,160
Speaker 3:  capitalism, man. You know, like, it's a,

254
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,430
Speaker 1:  That's all I want. If that's, if that's what you got out of your time within

255
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,390
Speaker 1:  then mission accomplished. One of my favorite copyright cases I ever

256
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,200
Speaker 1:  had in law school was a Vanna white V Samsung

257
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,160
Speaker 1:  electronics. I think that's the case. Caption, Samsung had an

258
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,000
Speaker 1:  ad for like washing machines where a robot

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,240
Speaker 1:  like turned letters like wheel of fortune.

260
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,140
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And Vanna white was like, that robotics is too much like me, you're

261
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,740
Speaker 1:  using my likeness and that's an unauthorized use of me and it's like a

262
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,730
Speaker 1:  robot. And she was like, it's amazing. And my law professor

263
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,700
Speaker 1:  was like, yeah, it's a California case like California, like the California

264
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,820
Speaker 1:  courts are always inside with Hollywood. Like it was like open in his mind.

265
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,630
Speaker 1:  It was open and shut. Like the corrupt California courts have

266
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,560
Speaker 1:  once again taken the side of big Hollywood, but it's like,

267
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,370
Speaker 1:  that was ages ago. And now we're all the way to, there's a digital Keanu

268
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,580
Speaker 1:  Reeves that is contractually obligated to only do what the owner use wants.

269
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,120
Speaker 1:  It's pretty good. You did some other, I mean your senior metaverse reporter

270
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,870
Speaker 1:  Alex, that's your, that's your title? Do you all see it? I mean, he had a

271
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,260
Speaker 1:  big week. He's also saw snaps, AR spectacles. You got to try them

272
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,590
Speaker 1:  on they're there. They seem very prototype to me.

273
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,980
Speaker 3:  Oh, very prototyping. I mean, the battery lasts for 30 minutes. The first

274
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,880
Speaker 3:  pair they gave me overheated, after less than 10, they

275
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,750
Speaker 3:  had like four onsite that they tried to like seamlessly swap out. As I

276
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,620
Speaker 3:  tried different lenses, you know, which are snaps, AR effects

277
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,190
Speaker 3:  so that I never noticed the battery. Definitely the best software on any

278
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,130
Speaker 3:  air, air glasses I've used. You can tell, they've thought a lot about the

279
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,120
Speaker 3:  interface. There's like this carousel you see through your eyes and it's

280
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,960
Speaker 3:  a touch thing and there's voice the thing that is the most promising on these

281
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,710
Speaker 3:  that I think probably won't be cool for several more years is a scan

282
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,640
Speaker 3:  button. I did another video thing on our site about a month or two ago

283
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,030
Speaker 3:  about this and the Snapchat app. It's like visual search, right? Google lens.

284
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,030
Speaker 3:  It's their stab at this. And they're working with a lot of other developers

285
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,600
Speaker 3:  right now, but I scanned a plant, you know, with my glasses and it

286
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,500
Speaker 3:  recommended some plant-based lenses. And like, you expand that

287
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,460
Speaker 3:  out a few years and you're walking around and you can just search

288
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,180
Speaker 3:  anything. I mean, it's, it's going to be wild. And they also like, they're

289
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,660
Speaker 3:  doing like club mapping to your clothing where like a

290
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,500
Speaker 3:  AR jacket will drape. Like it would naturally imagine putting

291
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,890
Speaker 3:  that on someone, you know, three years glasses or making them they're your

292
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,920
Speaker 3:  Bitmoji. Right? Like there's just so many ways that this is going to get

293
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,760
Speaker 3:  trippy, but yeah, definitely a prototype, but they're being like oddly humble

294
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,270
Speaker 3:  about it. Especially considering like the way that the first spectacles were

295
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,050
Speaker 3:  hyped beyond belief. And they ended up sitting

296
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,040
Speaker 3:  on 40 million and unsold inventory that they had right off. They're

297
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,820
Speaker 3:  just not selling these. They're giving them to hundreds of AR

298
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,150
Speaker 3:  creators just to try and play with. And it's, it's really a learning thing

299
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,510
Speaker 3:  for them. And I think that's really smart because if these things were sold

300
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,970
Speaker 3:  to the public, they probably cost thousands of dollars and everyone would

301
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,810
Speaker 3:  be like, what the hell? This thing dies after 30 minutes, what's the field

302
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,710
Speaker 3:  of view. Like it's so narrow, that's the thing like they optimized

303
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,580
Speaker 3:  for brightness and for color. And so, you know,

304
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,390
Speaker 3:  maybe half of the frame is the wave guide is what you can actually see. And

305
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,110
Speaker 3:  so I found that the lenses looked better in post, on my

306
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,590
Speaker 3:  phone, seeing what I was seeing through the glasses than they did in the

307
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,460
Speaker 3:  glasses, because I had Y wide field of view. So once that gets

308
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,060
Speaker 3:  there, once it fills that full kind of this thing looks like a cyber truck

309
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,420
Speaker 3:  on your face. So like once it fuels that wide kind of

310
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,290
Speaker 3:  lens, it's going to be wild. I mean, it's, it's going to take years

311
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,220
Speaker 3:  though, to get there. This really showed that battery and display are the

312
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,120
Speaker 3:  two things that I don't know are going to be cracked for a while.

313
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,540
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That the let's talk about this play for just a couple more minutes.

314
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,470
Speaker 4:  I mean, I know the field of view is narrow, but was it good? I mean,

315
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,890
Speaker 4:  the Dem doing this outdoors is kind of a flex, like I've done hollowlens

316
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,130
Speaker 4:  stuff. Disclosure. My wife works for

317
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,120
Speaker 4:  meta. What's the division that is maybe called

318
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,190
Speaker 4:  Oculus. Maybe not, I don't know over

319
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,850
Speaker 4:  there, but like, what was it

320
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,240
Speaker 4:  good? Like if, if you were to just take the display that you had at give

321
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,960
Speaker 4:  it a proper field of you, would you have been like, this? Is it

322
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,530
Speaker 4:  it's there? Or is it still feel like weirded, pixelated and

323
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,400
Speaker 4:  whatever?

324
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,030
Speaker 3:  No, it wasn't pixelated. It was, they have 2000 nits of brightness in this

325
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,720
Speaker 3:  thing. So it works a lot sunlight, which is why the battery

326
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,500
Speaker 3:  dies and it over needs after 10 minutes, but they're optimizing for

327
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,460
Speaker 3:  visual richness so that people can make compelling AR experiences

328
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,120
Speaker 3:  so that when the tech catches up the software kind of pipelines already

329
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,420
Speaker 3:  there, which is another piece of this they're being, I think very smart about

330
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,290
Speaker 3:  kind of seeding the developer ecosystem very early Metta is not doing

331
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,040
Speaker 3:  this, which I think is curious. But yeah, no, the display was

332
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,460
Speaker 3:  probably the most impressive I've used on a standalone device. Again, this

333
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,210
Speaker 3:  thing isn't tethered to anything for, for complainant and the glasses were

334
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,900
Speaker 3:  light. Like, I didn't feel like they were heavy on my face

335
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,860
Speaker 3:  or like I wanted to take them off after a few minutes. Like you could theoretically

336
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,950
Speaker 3:  wear these all day and be fine. You'd look really weird.

337
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,940
Speaker 3:  But so yeah, I think there's a lot of promise there.

338
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,630
Speaker 3:  And, you know, snap is this kind of silent, dark horse in these AR glasses

339
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,900
Speaker 3:  metaverse wars where they were actually kind of the first to like, think

340
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,710
Speaker 3:  about this in a serious way. And they're just kind of quietly iterating

341
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,650
Speaker 3:  now a little bit in public, which I think is interesting because they'd been

342
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,860
Speaker 3:  so secretive, but yeah, I mean the display apparently is so good that they

343
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,670
Speaker 3:  bought the supplier. That was one of our first

344
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,540
Speaker 3:  scooch that I did a wave optics. They're our largest deal ever for

345
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,750
Speaker 3:  half a billion dollars just to get the kind of display tech lock for

346
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,500
Speaker 3:  them. So, yeah, man, this is all, it's all starting to come

347
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,280
Speaker 3:  together. I mean, it's definitely not compelling for consumers,

348
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,740
Speaker 3:  but this was the first time doing one of these demos where I was like in

349
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,830
Speaker 3:  a few years, I can see this being really compelling. And it's going to kind

350
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,440
Speaker 3:  of flip how we think about computing. I think I have a big,

351
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,220
Speaker 1:  I agree with you like the, the part where you can see the software

352
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,820
Speaker 1:  applications are way ahead of the hardware is utterly

353
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,420
Speaker 1:  fascinating. That hasn't really happened in many other

354
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,870
Speaker 1:  places. Like you just like throw a dart at the board and think

355
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,170
Speaker 1:  about some other hyped, future hardware,

356
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,800
Speaker 1:  like 3d TVs, or like interactive

357
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,370
Speaker 1:  TVs as a whole, right? Like you're going to be shopping on your TV or you're

358
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,270
Speaker 1:  gonna be watching all the live cameras from a foot. Like none of that has

359
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,200
Speaker 1:  come to pass. It's all just streams. Like the software, even

360
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,040
Speaker 1:  of the hardware and the service ecosystems are there. The software

361
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,880
Speaker 1:  is kind of where it always was. In this case, a hardware is nowhere near

362
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,060
Speaker 1:  close, but everyone already has a pretty clear picture

363
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,780
Speaker 1:  of what it should be. And the

364
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,740
Speaker 1:  basics of like, we're going to point a camera at a thing and then do some

365
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,640
Speaker 1:  computer stuff and then layer some information or experiences

366
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,510
Speaker 1:  over that thing. That picture is really clear. So you can already like, apple

367
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,110
Speaker 1:  is already doing it. Snap is already doing it. Sam started doing it on Apple's

368
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,710
Speaker 1:  phones. Like you can see, but the hardware is really far

369
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,400
Speaker 1:  away.

370
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,210
Speaker 3:  And these lenses though beat these lenses are getting smart. So you can

371
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,450
Speaker 3:  have links and lenses now for the first time that kick out to like a store.

372
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,660
Speaker 3:  So if a creator makes like a something for their shoe, you can just go buy

373
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,530
Speaker 3:  it in the lens. There's music from all the labels in there, they're

374
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,950
Speaker 3:  bringing in outside apps for the first time. So you can have like FTX, crypto

375
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,010
Speaker 3:  trading in a lens or AQI whether you can pump in like the

376
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,970
Speaker 3:  temperature into a lens. So they're starting to become

377
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,870
Speaker 3:  interactive in real time where, before they were these static kind of more

378
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,530
Speaker 3:  artsy things. Yeah. It's like they were saying someone has spent two years

379
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,920
Speaker 3:  making a lens that can measure anything like, and there's another one that

380
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,790
Speaker 3:  can tell you if your surfboard is a good surf board based on its contours.

381
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,660
Speaker 3:  And so they're just coming up with all these wild things that once we have

382
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,000
Speaker 3:  these glasses, like it's, it's gonna be

383
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,120
Speaker 1:  Cool. I won't give too much away because it won't be out by the time you

384
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,990
Speaker 1:  listen to this. But my antic CEO, John hankie is on decoder next week

385
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,560
Speaker 1:  nine and tech makes Pokemon go. They have a big partnership with Qualcomm

386
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,830
Speaker 1:  to make smart glasses. I've got a references on floating around. I fell

387
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,430
Speaker 1:  down an absolute research rabbit hole of how these

388
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,940
Speaker 1:  displays work before I talked to him, they're all kind of the same, right?

389
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,570
Speaker 1:  You get like, there's two tiny LCD displays and the stems of the

390
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,080
Speaker 1:  glasses. And then there's a reflector and there's a bunch of

391
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,560
Speaker 1:  mirrors are not mirrors. There's a bunch of codings or

392
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,280
Speaker 1:  etchings on layers, wave guides. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bounce

393
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,970
Speaker 1:  that display onto your eyes. And so I, you know, I just pushed him. I was

394
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,570
Speaker 1:  like, is this it is like, can I go, am I going to go from here to here? I

395
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,200
Speaker 1:  see the first ever LCD display

396
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,040
Speaker 1:  on a primitive smartphone. And I know in my mind,

397
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,880
Speaker 1:  this technology is really important. Soon. LCDs will take over every

398
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,780
Speaker 1:  display in the world with some OLEDs on the side, right? Like, is

399
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,500
Speaker 1:  this the technology bet? Or is it, this is the best we

400
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,290
Speaker 1:  got and maybe something else will come up. And he was like, this is it like

401
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,280
Speaker 1:  this, this wave guy technology will, it will get to where we want it

402
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,270
Speaker 1:  to go. Which I guess if you're like in the partnership with Qualcomm or shipping

403
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,110
Speaker 1:  wave guide, like maybe that's what you say, but snap made that big investment

404
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,040
Speaker 1:  and bought that company. It makes wave guides. There are Hollins

405
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,970
Speaker 1:  is wave, like magic leap was supposed to make something else. And

406
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,790
Speaker 1:  they ended up at wave guides. It's what we got.

407
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,690
Speaker 4:  I don't know, because again, HoloLens has been around

408
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,080
Speaker 4:  and like it's wacky wave guides with an LCD. You're like,

409
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,530
Speaker 4:  okay, get better at the manufacturing process, the LCD gets

410
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,490
Speaker 4:  bigger and more responsive. Like there's like a hardware improvement

411
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,420
Speaker 4:  arc there. And I don't, I am not smart enough to know.

412
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,450
Speaker 4:  Is that what the hardware improvement arc for a wave guide is? Is it just

413
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,320
Speaker 4:  like we get better and better at etching until we can finally make them be?

414
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,010
Speaker 3:  My understanding is these things are constrained by size and battery and

415
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,700
Speaker 3:  like thermodynamics more than anything like these wave guides can power.

416
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,510
Speaker 3:  There's a reason magic leap raised $2 billion. It's because they had

417
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,570
Speaker 3:  people look into a thing called the beast. That was the size of the

418
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,080
Speaker 3:  closet that had all the computing, it needed to power this thing

419
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,770
Speaker 3:  appropriately. So when they have that, they can do incredible things

420
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,160
Speaker 3:  already. It's just getting it into a form factor. This is what Zuckerberg

421
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,460
Speaker 3:  is talking about with me. And Casey, like getting that form factor is, is

422
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,480
Speaker 3:  the hard part, right?

423
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,230
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But, but the beast, it's just like the best quote

424
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,620
Speaker 1:  ever. The CEO of magic leap was like, we're hacking the GPU of your

425
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,860
Speaker 1:  brain. And what, what he meant was they're going to send light into your

426
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,730
Speaker 1:  eyes in a way that mimics reality, that isn't just an emissive

427
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,480
Speaker 1:  flat plane wave guys, or just a flat plane of light,

428
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,750
Speaker 1:  right. It just, all the electronics are in the stems of the glasses. And

429
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,620
Speaker 1:  it's bouncing the light through that. So Dieter your question. Like if you

430
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,400
Speaker 1:  watch, there's like lots of like trade

431
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,790
Speaker 1:  industry presentations from wave guide suppliers. I need, I'm telling you,

432
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,690
Speaker 1:  I fell deep into it. And like all their presentations are like,

433
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,050
Speaker 1:  here's our process. Here's where the cost is. Here's where the cost is coming

434
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,290
Speaker 1:  down. And they're trying to convince you basically that they're using

435
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:49,280
Speaker 1:  standard glass, making screen, making techniques to

436
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,000
Speaker 1:  make this next generation of wave guide pieces of glass. The actual

437
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,930
Speaker 1:  display is still just like a tiny little LCD and the stems

438
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,290
Speaker 1:  of the glasses. Right. They're just bouncing it in front of your eyes with

439
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,040
Speaker 1:  these wave guides that they're still expensive. So like they're trying to

440
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,940
Speaker 1:  make that cheaper, but they haven't, I don't know. I don't know that it's

441
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,720
Speaker 1:  the bet. Like it feels like it's the resistive touch screen of the

442
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,200
Speaker 1:  AR world, you know, that can get you there. And then someday Steve jobs is

443
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,840
Speaker 1:  going to show up with like the capacitive touch screen iPhone. Everyone's

444
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,320
Speaker 1:  going to be like, oh, that's what we should have.

445
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,620
Speaker 3:  This is a good segue to apple because there is a continuum here where the

446
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,520
Speaker 3:  wave guys in the air glasses are happening on one side of this. That's definitely

447
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,420
Speaker 3:  several years out at minimum till we have that at scale what's

448
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,080
Speaker 3:  happening in the near term. And I think 20, 22 will be the year of is

449
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,070
Speaker 3:  pass through mixed reality, proper LCD, whatever it's

450
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,890
Speaker 3:  going to be, no wave guides, but basically tricking you

451
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,250
Speaker 3:  by piping and video of the outside world and mixing it with the

452
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,610
Speaker 3:  graphics. And that's what Apple's going to do. It's what med has got with

453
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,820
Speaker 3:  Cambridge, which is this headset they're working on for next

454
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,780
Speaker 3:  year. And I think that's going to really show people that

455
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,110
Speaker 3:  there is something there's like a stop gap before we get to AR glasses. And

456
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,840
Speaker 3:  it's that mixed reality pass through.

457
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,470
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I think that's like the reason that apple is doing

458
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,890
Speaker 1:  pastor video in a VR headset and potentially why Matt is doing it

459
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,850
Speaker 1:  too, is because apple cannot ship glasses with a teeny tiny field of view.

460
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,390
Speaker 1:  They get really hot. They they've got to ship a, it like their brand is

461
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,140
Speaker 1:  finished consumer products. And that core technology of a piece

462
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,100
Speaker 1:  of a display that you can look through is just like, what we got

463
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,580
Speaker 1:  is wave guide. I'm like, I encourage everyone. Like if you're a huge nerd,

464
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,880
Speaker 1:  you'll see in the shot, like, go look at how you guys were. It's neat. It's

465
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,630
Speaker 1:  super cool. But at the end of the day, it's like, you're wearing the entire

466
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,200
Speaker 1:  hollow lens in your head and you've got like a post-it stamp in the middle

467
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,320
Speaker 1:  of your field of vision. It's like put the spark plug in the

468
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,140
Speaker 1:  ATV, you know, like this is not that

469
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,070
Speaker 1:  great. I think it's really neat. Like we're

470
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,730
Speaker 1:  just in a place now. I think it's fascinating that every software developer

471
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,450
Speaker 1:  is like ready for this. And the hardware is just like years, like

472
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,380
Speaker 1:  five, at least out from what I can tell the other thing, the little

473
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,870
Speaker 1:  decoder preview, I'll give you, you were talking about how snap has filters.

474
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,950
Speaker 1:  Like everyone could be wearing different clothes. So I was like, how are

475
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,760
Speaker 1:  you going to govern reality? Like in, and he was like, everyone can just

476
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,240
Speaker 1:  pick and choose. Like, what if we all just like, it's like, I don't govern

477
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,790
Speaker 1:  what song you listened to and you walked down the street. Why should I, why

478
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,940
Speaker 1:  should I govern what you're looking at? And he was just like, there's only

479
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,870
Speaker 1:  a marketplace of realities. This is my new phrase. It's going to be terrifying.

480
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,470
Speaker 1:  Put that on a

481
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,370
Speaker 3:  Shirt.

482
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,300
Speaker 1:  Yeah, this is gonna be great. All right, we should take a break and we should

483
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,760
Speaker 1:  come back. There's a, there's like a lot of streaming he's talking about.

484
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,120
Speaker 1:  We'll wrap

485
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,020
Speaker 1:  back.

486
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,300
Speaker 1:  All right. We're back there is like a lot of, how would you describe this

487
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,400
Speaker 1:  low stakes streaming drama,

488
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,300
Speaker 4:  Low stakes streaming drama, and like news. That seems unimportant, but

489
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,220
Speaker 4:  actually could be massively important.

490
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,760
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's like, it's, it's that? It's like, we're going to have to convince

491
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,940
Speaker 1:  you that a lot of these things are important. So buckle

492
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,810
Speaker 1:  up, let's start the Keanu Reeves, Karen Ross video app,

493
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,720
Speaker 1:  because of the game awards. They're announcing the unreal stuff there, but

494
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,110
Speaker 1:  Google is announcing specific game wards to it, which is by the way, we are

495
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,040
Speaker 1:  recording this before the game awards happen, but you're listening to

496
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,240
Speaker 1:  it after they've happened.

497
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,360
Speaker 4:  Right. So imagine there, we're just assuming there's like huge game streaming

498
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,900
Speaker 4:  news and we're reacting to that. It's amazing. It's going to change everything.

499
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,580
Speaker 4:  We don't know,

500
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,620
Speaker 1:  But there's some like Google news coming. Yeah. Well,

501
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,460
Speaker 4:  This isn't streaming, but apparently Google play games is going to be available

502
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,300
Speaker 4:  on windows. So it's like Android up some windows. Here we

503
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,200
Speaker 4:  go. And it's interesting instead of just bringing

504
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,560
Speaker 4:  the whole of Google play Android apps, they're bringing Google play

505
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,530
Speaker 4:  games, which is a fascinating decision.

506
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,950
Speaker 1:  Are they bringing that into Microsoft's weird Android

507
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,870
Speaker 1:  app universe?

508
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,790
Speaker 4:  Unclear. What do you mean by that?

509
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,730
Speaker 1:  Like Microsoft signed a deal with Amazon. They use the Amazon app store to

510
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,970
Speaker 1:  get Android apps on windows. Right. But then they were also like, you can

511
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,060
Speaker 1:  use any app store you want, so are they building like a special windows?

512
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,200
Speaker 1:  Google play games. Yeah.

513
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,140
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They're making Google play games, a Google play games store where you

514
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,830
Speaker 4:  can download and install Android games for when

515
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,610
Speaker 1:  And that's running inside of the windows, Android app compatibility. Not

516
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,800
Speaker 1:  some weird new Google layer.

517
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,730
Speaker 4:  So that is a little bit unclear because it's

518
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,150
Speaker 4:  like Google. Isn't like partnering with Microsoft to make this happen. They're

519
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:53,110
Speaker 4:  just doing it.

520
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,140
Speaker 1:  This is going to go great. Yeah. Okay. So that's one thing. We'll see how

521
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,770
Speaker 1:  that goes. You can see how Google just needs to diversify its revenue base

522
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,610
Speaker 1:  has all the app store drama continues to go like

523
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,480
Speaker 1:  getting more of its game stuff out in the world is I think good for

524
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,990
Speaker 1:  Google. Like apple would love this to be happening on the Mac. I just don't

525
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,690
Speaker 1:  think they're ever going to convince any game developer to take the Mac seriously.

526
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,350
Speaker 1:  Even the game developers on the iPhone are like why maybe with like, as M

527
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,010
Speaker 1:  one chips become more widespread game, developers will make the easy jump

528
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,980
Speaker 1:  to games on the Mac, but it just kind of hasn't happened yet.

529
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,940
Speaker 4:  I mean, the whole question with games right now is like, what is the

530
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,030
Speaker 4:  future of like the platforms that you're going to be thinking about? Like

531
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,510
Speaker 4:  what the games run on because they keep making Android

532
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,200
Speaker 4:  games. That seems to like, you know, I, I now believe

533
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,600
Speaker 4:  that Android gaming phones exist and have a purpose. I've been

534
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,500
Speaker 4:  convinced by who just looking at the world, looking at the

535
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,530
Speaker 4:  market, looking at the Chinese market. Like they don't, they they're not

536
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,400
Speaker 4:  making them for no reason. Yeah. So there's that there's of course the

537
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,180
Speaker 4:  various streaming platforms. There's windows,

538
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,600
Speaker 4:  there's Xbox there's PlayStation. There's like the

539
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,600
Speaker 4:  various inner versions of Xbox and it's streaming

540
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,790
Speaker 1:  Stadia now runs on LG TVs.

541
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,480
Speaker 4:  Yes. So the thing that's interesting about that to me

542
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,230
Speaker 4:  is, well, of course it does. It's just like, it's just a video

543
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,190
Speaker 4:  stream. Yeah. Like the it's potentially a big deal.

544
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,090
Speaker 4:  It's like the, the rules of how you think about what your screen

545
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,990
Speaker 4:  can do are changing. Like they were changing slowly

546
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,560
Speaker 4:  and now they're changing really quickly. So whether or not you can just

547
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,550
Speaker 4:  play console quality games on your LGTV was just a matter of

548
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,090
Speaker 4:  when did they get around to creating the, you know,

549
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,930
Speaker 4:  casting and points app for web alas. It's actually

550
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,680
Speaker 4:  not that difficult. And I just, I don't know, like

551
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,670
Speaker 4:  where that's going to shake out. Are you going to care where your game comes

552
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,310
Speaker 4:  from? Are you going to care if it's local or streaming? And the, the

553
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,540
Speaker 4:  fact that it's, it's just a question of like, who's gotten around to building

554
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,140
Speaker 4:  a client for the thing this even applies to like Google play games on

555
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,950
Speaker 4:  windows is really interesting. So like, honestly,

556
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,760
Speaker 4:  this kind of leads us up to talking about the

557
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,000
Speaker 4:  Roku YouTube drama a little bit, I think. Yeah. Other than

558
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,910
Speaker 1:  It's settle it this week. So Roku and Google

559
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,540
Speaker 1:  were about to Sue each other. Like they had switched.

560
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,500
Speaker 1:  It hadn't gotten very far. They were, who was going to kick YouTube off

561
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,250
Speaker 1:  its platform. Google had done some shady stuff on other platforms. They built

562
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,850
Speaker 1:  YouTube TV into the YouTube app. Cause he can't get rid of the YouTube app,

563
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,540
Speaker 1:  but they were at the kind of the brinksmanship point. They're going to

564
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,290
Speaker 1:  walk,

565
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,000
Speaker 4:  They're going to pull YouTube from Roku,

566
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,780
Speaker 1:  Which I pull YouTube from Roku. And I gotta say the arguments were

567
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,620
Speaker 1:  dumb. Like if you read like Roku put all of these blog

568
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,310
Speaker 1:  posts and like whatever, like the arguments they were having were when you

569
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,430
Speaker 1:  push the Roku voice search button and the YouTube app is

570
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,940
Speaker 1:  open, what voice search should you go to?

571
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,900
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Okay. Google was like Google, like ours and record was

572
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,360
Speaker 1:  like, no, the operating systems. Yeah.

573
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,260
Speaker 4:  By the way, they won that front. Like Samsung, unlike my Samsung frame TV,

574
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,800
Speaker 4:  the microphone button, like it's a Google button, it's a Google assistant

575
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,580
Speaker 4:  button. But when you're in the YouTube app, it ceases to be a Google assistant

576
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,460
Speaker 4:  button and it becomes a YouTube search button. Yeah.

577
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,330
Speaker 1:  Yeah. These arguments are like, they're very Vergecast arguments.

578
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,990
Speaker 1:  Like what do you think then should the native control

579
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,830
Speaker 1:  supersede the applications control. Right? And like, there are

580
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,950
Speaker 1:  other ones where if you had the YouTube app

581
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,520
Speaker 1:  open and you search for a movie using Roku voice

582
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,520
Speaker 1:  search, the native Roku voice search

583
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,390
Speaker 1:  would pull movies from the applications that supported its

584
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,120
Speaker 1:  library. Right. And so at Google's big complaint was like, this movie is

585
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,020
Speaker 1:  available for free on YouTube. You should be showing users,

586
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,980
Speaker 1:  which sounds great. But also if you're in the YouTube app, like you

587
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,910
Speaker 1:  should like it. None of it made sense. We were like how actual

588
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,870
Speaker 1:  people use their software, but

589
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,650
Speaker 1:  it all just seemed like little corner cases of what the buttons on your route

590
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,340
Speaker 1:  did. If the YouTube app was open and the, like, it just seems like Google

591
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,100
Speaker 1:  believes that people open the YouTube app and live in at 24 hours a day when

592
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,000
Speaker 1:  they watch TV, which maybe people do, but does not seem that

593
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,490
Speaker 1:  likely when you're searching for like a Disney

594
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,200
Speaker 1:  movie.

595
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,320
Speaker 3:  I gotta say, hearing you guys talk about all this makes me think there should

596
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
Speaker 3:  just be some good old fashioned consolidation in this

597
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,090
Speaker 3:  industry.

598
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,950
Speaker 4:  Has there been enough?

599
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,880
Speaker 1:  And then there's like, there's like ad money in the background. Right. Right.

600
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,510
Speaker 4:  Well, and so this is like, there's this like great inversion where you, you

601
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,870
Speaker 4:  tweet about this new, I I'm selling your idea, but like, it used to be that

602
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,860
Speaker 4:  like what you could play on your screen, whether it's a game or a video

603
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,730
Speaker 4:  or whatever was like really dependent on who your service provider

604
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,660
Speaker 4:  was, what the screens capabilities was, you know, what platform

605
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,530
Speaker 4:  you picked, et cetera. And now it's completely dependent on have

606
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,370
Speaker 4:  some deals been made. And as someone like done some engineering work to make

607
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,720
Speaker 4:  an app, your app or not.

608
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,680
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it is utterly. No one knows what the terms of this new deal are.

609
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,250
Speaker 1:  It is a multi-year deal. YouTube and YouTube TV will like

610
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,240
Speaker 1:  stay on the Roku platform. It's funny, Rick Roku is calling Google and

611
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,050
Speaker 1:  uncheck monopolous throughout all this. Because when, when they like

612
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,530
Speaker 1:  threatened to kick YouTube TV off the whole like money

613
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,920
Speaker 1:  dispute, is it Roku? Hardware is extraordinarily

614
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,670
Speaker 1:  cheap, right? It's like 30 bucks, 20 bucks. They don't, they're not making

615
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,660
Speaker 1:  any money in a hardware. All they make money on is when you sign up, just

616
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,320
Speaker 1:  like in any other app store, when you sign up for Disney, plus they get a

617
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,250
Speaker 1:  cut, right? They get a bounty of that signup. When Hulu

618
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,210
Speaker 1:  runs an ad on the Roku, like either those ads are served by Roku

619
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,930
Speaker 1:  ad services or Roku gets a cut. Like those that's just

620
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,860
Speaker 1:  like the app store itself. When, when any commerce happens in an

621
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,850
Speaker 1:  app, apple wants a cut. When any advertising or subscription happens on

622
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,490
Speaker 1:  a Roku, Roku gets a cut. And that's how they subsidize all the hardware.

623
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,480
Speaker 1:  This is the economics of every TV, by the way, like the

624
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,350
Speaker 1:  LG, the reason the TVs are cheap is because all of the money is made

625
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,980
Speaker 1:  through ongoing transactions. Like this story of adding a chip to things

626
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,710
Speaker 1:  and then making them connected so that they can just like charge you for

627
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:08,670
Speaker 1:  the rest of your life. That's that's where that was happening. But that's

628
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,660
Speaker 1:  totally backwards. Right? You used to pay your cable company and then the

629
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,590
Speaker 1:  cable company would pay ESPN. Yeah. Now you're paying Disney and Disney

630
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,400
Speaker 1:  is hang Roku. Right? And like, I don't know if that's good or bad, but it's,

631
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,520
Speaker 1:  it's clear. Lo Roku sees itself as like, you're not going to get another

632
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,510
Speaker 1:  TV box or have 50 TV boxes. They're going to have one and that one

633
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,550
Speaker 1:  should have all the apps you want. And if you want to be on that one, you

634
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,880
Speaker 1:  have to meet their terms, show up in the interface in front of other people.

635
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,400
Speaker 1:  And the one thing they can't get rid of is YouTube. So when they kick YouTube

636
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,150
Speaker 1:  TV off, like screw it, you're gone. But then Google can add YouTube

637
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,990
Speaker 1:  TV to YouTube because they can't think YouTube like

638
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,650
Speaker 1:  are, are aren't. They they're like both monopolists in that way. Like

639
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,980
Speaker 1:  Roku controls. Most of the streaming platform business in the

640
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,400
Speaker 1:  country. I don't know. Anyway, it's over. We have no idea what this deal

641
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,430
Speaker 1:  is. A bunch of people on a smoke cigars on

642
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,420
Speaker 1:  zoom and came to terms

643
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,520
Speaker 1:  it's shady. We'll see. Yeah,

644
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,450
Speaker 4:  But they're back. But so in theory, a couple of years from now, all

645
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,420
Speaker 4:  this is going to get shaken up again. So Jennifer Patterson Tuohy on her

646
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,340
Speaker 4:  site basically broke the news that there is a part of a standard

647
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,730
Speaker 4:  for matter. So matter is the connected home over IP standard. We're going

648
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,090
Speaker 4:  to have a whole Vergecast about this on Tuesday. So buckle up for that. We're

649
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,390
Speaker 4:  going to talk about this, but because Jennifer published a story today, I

650
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,050
Speaker 4:  want to talk about it briefly. So there's a part of the spec called matter

651
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,410
Speaker 4:  TV. I don't think most people realize what's going to be part of this smart

652
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,860
Speaker 4:  home standard. And it's basically just universal

653
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,700
Speaker 4:  casting either from app to app or app to TVs. Once they're there,

654
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,510
Speaker 4:  that all of these big companies have agreed. Oh yeah. If you want to tell

655
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,990
Speaker 4:  your screen to play a video, this standard will be

656
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:50,980
Speaker 4:  supported so it can replace airplay. It could replace Google cast.

657
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,310
Speaker 4:  It can replace whatever weird stuff Samsung

658
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,180
Speaker 4:  does. Amazon is like written the spec cause they really need it because

659
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,020
Speaker 4:  people have echo devices, but they don't necessarily have fire TVs,

660
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,520
Speaker 4:  but it's like part of the spec. And so like

661
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,280
Speaker 4:  casting might actually not suck next year or beginning of next

662
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,910
Speaker 4:  year.

663
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,900
Speaker 1:  Oh, I don't think doubt apple or Google or walking away from their

664
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,800
Speaker 1:  standards.

665
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,560
Speaker 4:  Well, no, but they're not walking away from their standards, but this standard

666
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,950
Speaker 4:  will also be supported and they are part, they like signed off on the

667
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,280
Speaker 4:  spec. So if you have a TV that supports

668
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,030
Speaker 4:  matter, it will support having this casting

669
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,020
Speaker 4:  standard hit it.

670
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,630
Speaker 1:  I mean, that's fair. I just don't think, I don't think this casting center

671
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,700
Speaker 1:  run up in iOS for years to come. No,

672
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,740
Speaker 3:  This is going to fail for sure.

673
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,560
Speaker 4:  I mean, it probably will. Why do you think it will fail? Because,

674
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,340
Speaker 3:  Because no, like we are everything you all were just saying like this entire

675
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,300
Speaker 3:  there's so much infighting right now in this space, everyone wants to

676
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,080
Speaker 3:  own their layer and their, their system and their

677
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,680
Speaker 3:  substrate of the TV experience and some

678
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,870
Speaker 3:  startup or whatever's there. There's no way. There's no way.

679
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,170
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So, but we're going to get to this next week. But like they have walked

680
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,920
Speaker 4:  away from that walled garden fight in the smart home. Everyone's like

681
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,160
Speaker 4:  we have hit the ceiling. We can't make any more money. We can't grow this

682
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,970
Speaker 4:  pie, but I'm telling you the matter shit, just it, everything

683
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,720
Speaker 4:  is like inter-operating and it's going to work locally. And it's based

684
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,780
Speaker 4:  on like equal parts from all of these big tech companies. And they're

685
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,810
Speaker 4:  all, you know, it'll fall, it's a standard. It'll probably fall apart. But

686
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,800
Speaker 4:  like, it seems like your, like your doorbell is just

687
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,590
Speaker 4:  going to work and it's not going to be locked into a walled garden anymore.

688
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,750
Speaker 4:  If it supports matter and you're gonna want it support matter. Cause then,

689
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,650
Speaker 4:  you know, it's easier to buy stuff. And if the matter TV

690
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,530
Speaker 4:  thing gets like brought in with that spec as like a Trojan horse, that

691
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,730
Speaker 4:  could be interesting.

692
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,720
Speaker 3:  All I want to do is go to a hotel and be able to cast my phone to

693
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,500
Speaker 3:  the TV and not have to worry about, is it a

694
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,070
Speaker 3:  Chrome cast? Is it an apple TV? Usually I can't stream my

695
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:53,000
Speaker 3:  iPhone because it's like a Chrome cast. And it just something that fixes

696
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Speaker 3:  all that. Yeah. That's, that's going to be a trillion dollar company.

697
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,750
Speaker 4:  That's the, I mean, that's the matter spec is they, if, if the thing supports

698
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,260
Speaker 4:  it and it will see it locally and it will

699
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,220
Speaker 4:  either cast it locally from your phone or it'll like, just tell it the

700
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,730
Speaker 4:  URL that it needs to go grab from the internet. Yeah. Promises that it'll

701
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,720
Speaker 4:  all work. We'll see what it actually turns out to be. But I am very

702
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,630
Speaker 4:  optimistic about the smart home side of it. And the fact that there's like

703
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,230
Speaker 4:  a TV side being like brought in alongside that is

704
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,490
Speaker 4:  fascinating.

705
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,150
Speaker 1:  Well, you know, it's interesting. So apple didn't make a TV, which they should

706
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,020
Speaker 1:  instead of a car, it's put that out there. Continue to put that energy out

707
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,410
Speaker 1:  in the world, make a TV in our car. It seemed as soon as Warner lane, you

708
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,340
Speaker 1:  get it. No,

709
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,490
Speaker 4:  That's terrible. But that's my line. Come on.

710
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,880
Speaker 1:  I apologize everyone. But when I put the apple TV app everywhere, they gave

711
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,750
Speaker 1:  everybody airplay. It came along for the ride. So now every TV has

712
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,740
Speaker 1:  airplane Chromecast. So now you've got a third one if they don't

713
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,340
Speaker 1:  get like Samsung and LG, which are like

714
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,300
Speaker 1:  Vizio, right? Like I don't think Vizio is part of matter, but

715
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,200
Speaker 1:  Samsung, TCL, Panasonic and LG are all in matter.

716
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,980
Speaker 1:  That's a lot of TVs that might support this thing. Yeah. We'll see.

717
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,970
Speaker 1:  I have high hopes. What, I didn't see here anywhere. It was like, we're going

718
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,840
Speaker 1:  to make remote controls better.

719
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,470
Speaker 1:  No one seems at all like interested in doing

720
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,800
Speaker 4:  There's only so many problems technology can solve lie. That's true.

721
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,340
Speaker 1:  Okay. Can I, can I, can I go to my rabbit hole of my

722
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,020
Speaker 1:  streaming revenue rabbit hole?

723
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,940
Speaker 4:  Oh, is this a Spotify comedian thing?

724
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,030
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So there's this, there's this group that represents a bunch of comedians

725
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,570
Speaker 1:  called spoken giants, which is a great name. Yeah. And so they have this

726
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:36,290
Speaker 1:  new theory that they're arguing in Spotify about that resulted in

727
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,920
Speaker 1:  Spotify, removing a bunch of tracks from comedians

728
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,250
Speaker 1:  like Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish, Sean Laney, Jim Gaffigan, all off

729
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,610
Speaker 1:  Spotify. So they've got this idea that the written

730
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,420
Speaker 1:  jokes now constitute one work and the performance of the jokes

731
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,630
Speaker 1:  are another work and issue, right? So it's like

732
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,080
Speaker 1:  songwriters get one royalty stream and performers get another

733
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,140
Speaker 1:  often the songwriters and the performers and the same person they get paid

734
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,800
Speaker 1:  twice. This is like, there's like inventing a new, a new

735
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,460
Speaker 1:  revenue stream. Cause streaming revenue is so low that everyone's like trying

736
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,120
Speaker 1:  to find new money. So comedians have like come up with this new

737
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,840
Speaker 1:  lobbying groups, spoken giants to say that they're not

738
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,710
Speaker 1:  only just like telling jokes, but they're writing jokes

739
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:21,650
Speaker 1:  and then performing the jokes. And so the issue of the streaming revenue

740
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,280
Speaker 1:  for the audio recording and the publishing revenue for the jokes themselves,

741
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,550
Speaker 1:  which is just a wild way of thinking about comedians telling jokes. Because

742
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,190
Speaker 1:  for example, songwriters assume multiple people will

743
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,150
Speaker 1:  perform their songs over time. Comedians do not, no one

744
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,990
Speaker 1:  does a cover joke. Albums. It's just like not a thing.

745
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,870
Speaker 1:  That's pretty good. I'm doing

746
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:46,620
Speaker 1:  like an entire John Malaney cover album.

747
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,430
Speaker 4:  Like Tik TOK is full of cover jokes of just

748
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,760
Speaker 4:  people, lip sinking comedy routines. They're

749
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,770
Speaker 1:  Doing it to the audio. Sure.

750
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,050
Speaker 4:  But like it's a performance. Yeah.

751
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,360
Speaker 1:  I don't know. I don't actually have any idea how the Tech-Talk licensing

752
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,080
Speaker 1:  works. Yeah. I've always been fascinated by that. I just think it's the

753
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,010
Speaker 1:  pressure on the people who make the content for Spotify. The revenue

754
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,400
Speaker 1:  pressure on everybody is so high because the pay rates are so

755
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,330
Speaker 1:  low that like they're inventing this new concept, which would imply that

756
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,320
Speaker 1:  you should be able to like do an album of joke covers, put it on the

757
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,500
Speaker 1:  blockchain. Yeah. I think it's

758
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,100
Speaker 1:  fascinating. Ashley who writes Hotpod she and I are just

759
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,010
Speaker 1:  like staring at this being like, is this gonna work? Like Spotify

760
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:33,390
Speaker 1:  just was like, no. And she's like kicked him off. Yeah. Because Spotify doesn't

761
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,210
Speaker 1:  need a bunch of joke, albums. Like they're

762
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,930
Speaker 1:  fine. But it's like fascinating to me to see like

763
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,020
Speaker 1:  all of these ways, because the money has gotten so

764
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,980
Speaker 1:  bad that artists are creating new, lets NFTs. That's why every

765
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,940
Speaker 1:  artist is doing NFCS. But it's also like we're going to create a

766
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,210
Speaker 1:  new royalty structure for comedy out of

767
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,200
Speaker 1:  nothing.

768
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,590
Speaker 4:  We should do this for the Vergecast. We should get paid once for performing

769
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,920
Speaker 4:  it and paid an oh wait, we don't write it. Nevermind. We were writing it.

770
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,370
Speaker 1:  We're not going to prayers ago. We're contemporaneously writing this. What

771
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:09,180
Speaker 1:  does IP? But what is IP? What is IP? But what we

772
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,330
Speaker 1:  say, if someone wants to do a full cover of this episode of the verge

773
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,030
Speaker 1:  cast, you have to call us, I'll write you a

774
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:19,020
Speaker 1:  contract. It'll be cheap.

775
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,710
Speaker 1:  It won't cost a lot of money, but it will be ironclad that you have to perform

776
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,550
Speaker 1:  this Vergecast word for word, it'd be like 10

777
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,420
Speaker 1:  bucks. If you want to figure it out

778
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,110
Speaker 1:  like a screenplay of this verge cast. Look at that last little things. Apple

779
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,890
Speaker 1:  music is they got that weird voice plan for the home pods.

780
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,160
Speaker 4:  This is what I mean that like the capabilities of your device are dictated

781
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,670
Speaker 4:  by weird ass backroom contracts. Not by what the

782
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,600
Speaker 4:  capabilities of the device are. This voice plan is dominant knowing. And

783
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,260
Speaker 4:  I hate it.

784
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,800
Speaker 1:  And it's just because the record labels gave the same plan to Amazon. Yeah.

785
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,250
Speaker 1:  Well it's like what enables your smart speaker, right? You, you want to say

786
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,550
Speaker 1:  play some music to a smart speaker that can't be that you don't want to do

787
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,540
Speaker 1:  a deal with Spotify. Right? So you like make your own deal for

788
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,440
Speaker 1:  like cheap streaming just for the smart speaker. It's like

789
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,680
Speaker 1:  five bucks a month, right? Four bucks a month. Yeah. It's super cheap. It's

790
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,310
Speaker 1:  weird. And then Sonos is not supporting Amazon music, ultra

791
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,270
Speaker 1:  HD and Dolby Atmos on the new beam that supports Atmos

792
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,680
Speaker 1:  and the arc. I got,

793
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,920
Speaker 3:  I wanna say I got a piece of physical mail from Amazon asking me if I want

794
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,750
Speaker 3:  to try Amazon music

795
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,430
Speaker 1:  Amazing the other day. And I was

796
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,530
Speaker 3:  Like, that says a lot about Amazon music.

797
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,470
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That's my only thought there we're quickly getting to a place by the

798
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,460
Speaker 1:  way, where the combination of the service

799
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,450
Speaker 1:  you subscribe to and the headphones you have has

800
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,870
Speaker 1:  meaningful implications for what music you listen to.

801
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:47,710
Speaker 1:  Like you've got to have an Atmos service and Sonos speakers to listen to

802
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,770
Speaker 1:  Atlas music from Amazon, but

803
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,950
Speaker 1:  your apple AirPods, which supports spatial

804
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,730
Speaker 1:  audio. There's no way to listen to Amazon music from Amazon. And he's just

805
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,730
Speaker 1:  like, it's nuts. Like it happened. The bad thing

806
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,660
Speaker 1:  happened. I don't know what to tell you. It could be a lot worse. We could

807
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,380
Speaker 1:  be paying gas fees every time we listened to a song. I mean, don't put that

808
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,560
Speaker 1:  energy into the world, man. What are you it's going to be happening. There's

809
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,490
Speaker 1:  a New York times article this week, like a choice the New York times is

810
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,240
Speaker 1:  on it. Article about how wired had funds are trendy again.

811
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,110
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Do you see it as like I did it, this was me like the number of

812
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,050
Speaker 1:  people who were like, you got your wish. And I was like, there's still lightening

813
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:30,250
Speaker 1:  headphones.

814
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,490
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take a break. And we got the lightning round to end all

815
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,110
Speaker 1:  lightening rounds come up. We'll be right

816
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:39,250
Speaker 1:  back

817
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,670
Speaker 1:  Okay. We're back. We got there's like a chunk of Android lightning round

818
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,990
Speaker 1:  news. You're going to go through a tutor.

819
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:51,950
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So Google has a big update for

820
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,790
Speaker 4:  pixel, for Android 12. It's got a bug fix

821
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:59,720
Speaker 4:  list that is just three miles long, just

822
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,410
Speaker 4:  super, super. And like, you know, there's always like

823
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:07,130
Speaker 4:  the patch after the release where it's kind of big, but this one in particular

824
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:11,030
Speaker 4:  is like, oh, the pixel as reviewed is

825
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,660
Speaker 4:  not the one that they were hoping to get out the door. Like there's so many

826
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,410
Speaker 4:  fixes in this thing. And it also includes the launch feature where you're

827
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,380
Speaker 4:  going to be able to tap to snap, or you can double tap the thing and use

828
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,680
Speaker 4:  the snap camera, even though you're still on the lock screen. And then

829
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,550
Speaker 4:  immediately on the heels of that, there's an Android 12

830
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:32,390
Speaker 4:  L beta L large screens. I guess you

831
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:36,080
Speaker 4:  can install it on a pixel if you want to. For some reason you can.

832
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,410
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's just because, but it's meant for emulators. There's

833
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:43,370
Speaker 4:  like an Lenovo tablet that you can install it

834
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:47,030
Speaker 4:  on. If you want to see what it looks like, but it's clearly designed for

835
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,880
Speaker 4:  folding phones, right. And maybe they'll make another go at

836
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,420
Speaker 4:  tablets because they did the thing that should have done, which is like put

837
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,320
Speaker 4:  a proper dock on it, make rearranging windows via drag and drop part of

838
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,770
Speaker 4:  the system level thing and not a hack that Microsoft and Samsung have to

839
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:04,760
Speaker 4:  create, you know, like fix the notification dropdown

840
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,060
Speaker 4:  control panel drop thing. So it actually fills a screen instead of being

841
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,930
Speaker 4:  ridiculous, like the phone they've made Android, not terrible on big

842
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:15,530
Speaker 4:  screens or at least there's taking a couple of steps in that direction,

843
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:18,510
Speaker 4:  but there's just, there's no big screens to put it on.

844
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,460
Speaker 4:  Like, like there's the Kindles, there's like some random Samsung

845
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,360
Speaker 4:  tablets while we make some stuff, but like it's not here. And then there's

846
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,350
Speaker 4:  like the one Lenovo tablet that is, I think really only selling like

847
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:34,220
Speaker 4:  the UK. So I think it's interesting. I'm glad they're doing the

848
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:38,030
Speaker 4:  thing that they should've done a while ago to normalize the UI

849
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:41,600
Speaker 4:  on Microsoft two screen thing and Samsung folding and whatever else is

850
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,380
Speaker 4:  coming. But it's also like a pretty clear sign that yeah, they're, they're

851
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,090
Speaker 4:  still working on a pixel fold.

852
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:50,930
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, isn't everybody, I feel like we talked about like wave

853
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,690
Speaker 1:  guides in AR, but like also in the background, everybody is trying to make

854
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:57,440
Speaker 1:  a folding foam work. Right. I'm sure I was like dozens of folding phone

855
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,400
Speaker 1:  prototypes.

856
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,910
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Literally who wants this? Because it's awesome. I want this. It's

857
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:05,810
Speaker 4:  great. It's the best I've been carrying around. And I've had many

858
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:09,710
Speaker 4:  at home lately instead of just my phone, like a tiny phone, an iPad mini,

859
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:13,430
Speaker 4:  and it's lovely to have a little, a little device with a big screen.

860
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:17,330
Speaker 4:  And I, you know, I bought a full Butterfield to have and use

861
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:20,540
Speaker 4:  that for awhile. I'm telling you, man, like big screens are

862
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,530
Speaker 4:  great. Like big screens are great. You get a big screen

863
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,590
Speaker 4:  in your pocket. Great. I

864
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:29,310
Speaker 1:  Love the pro max. And I guess you're saying folding makes that also

865
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,450
Speaker 1:  compact. Right? That's

866
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,400
Speaker 4:  The promise of it makes it a little bit smaller. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean,

867
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,290
Speaker 1:  I also just think everybody knows that new form factors sell

868
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:40,710
Speaker 1:  in sack. You can deliver an actual folding phone that works without any of

869
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,250
Speaker 1:  the compromises that, you know, Samsung's already iterated its way through

870
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,930
Speaker 1:  some of the compromises. A lot

871
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,790
Speaker 4:  Of the compromises just

872
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:51,120
Speaker 1:  Get to like make that ad and be like, look, this iPhone folds in half. And

873
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,020
Speaker 1:  like, people will just instinctively. But yeah, I don't think they're, they're

874
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,800
Speaker 1:  trying to solve a huge problem. I think they can just see a, they can just

875
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,980
Speaker 1:  see a product that people instinctively understand.

876
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,580
Speaker 4:  The other pixel news is apparently the mail-in repair warehouse that they

877
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,570
Speaker 4:  were using. What was crazy was like people were mailing their

878
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,720
Speaker 4:  pixels in to get repaired and then the like their nudes

879
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,440
Speaker 4:  leaked. So that's horrible. And I want to tell

880
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,340
Speaker 4:  you that like PSA never send your phone in for repair without

881
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,880
Speaker 4:  wiping at first. But like if the thing is broken and you can't like use the

882
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,810
Speaker 4:  screen to wipe it, then like you're, you kind of have

883
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:31,410
Speaker 4:  no choice to send it in before you wipe your data in a lot of cases.

884
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:35,280
Speaker 4:  So yeah, not cool. That's all. It's

885
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,090
Speaker 4:  like what other advice can there be except to say not cool.

886
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,680
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, this is, I mean, we talk about the pixel. I'm like what

887
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,350
Speaker 1:  it, what Google needs to do. Like they need to market it. They need to sell

888
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,860
Speaker 1:  a lot of them. The back half of the story building these devices is like

889
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,270
Speaker 1:  service and support.

890
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:55,140
Speaker 4:  Right. And this is why we always recommended Samsung phones over pixels for

891
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,100
Speaker 4:  many years, even though we tend to prefer using pixels more ourselves,

892
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,700
Speaker 4:  because for the average person, you can walk to a

893
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,270
Speaker 4:  sprint store. If you use sprint and be like, fix my Samsung and they'd be

894
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,440
Speaker 4:  like, okay, yeah,

895
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,830
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Or more likely, there'll be like, your contract is up in three months.

896
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:13,470
Speaker 1:  Would you like a new Samsung? But like

897
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:17,400
Speaker 4:  Also what is, how, how sad is it that I still in my, in my, in

898
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,700
Speaker 4:  my world sprint still exists, just occurred to

899
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,750
Speaker 4:  me.

900
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,600
Speaker 1:  It's human was running those ads for free phones and they keep mentioning

901
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,420
Speaker 1:  sprint customers too. I don't know if you've seen these ads. They're like

902
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,240
Speaker 1:  everyone gets a free phone, including sprint customers. I'm like you own

903
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,540
Speaker 1:  sprint. Like you shut it down. Who are you talking

904
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,320
Speaker 1:  to? It's gone. It went away. Did you see this

905
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,130
Speaker 1:  Microsoft bug on? I can't tell you. I don't know if it's a Microsoft

906
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,910
Speaker 1:  bug, but if she had teams installed an Android phone, it

907
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:47,550
Speaker 1:  would occasionally prevent you from calling nine.

908
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well, so the, the phone app lets other apps plug into it. The iPhone

909
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,930
Speaker 4:  does this too. Right? And so there must be something where the teams

910
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,210
Speaker 4:  app wants to show up in your call log and that messed with that.

911
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:02,190
Speaker 4:  But this should never happen like that. That needs to be like

912
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,940
Speaker 4:  the phone app. There should be like an iron clad, you know, secure enclave

913
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,970
Speaker 4:  around that sort of functionality. It's ridiculous.

914
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,390
Speaker 1:  You wait, you, you think that they were trying to call 9 1 1 and it was routing

915
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,990
Speaker 1:  it through teams. And so like the nine 11 dispatcher was like getting a message.

916
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,290
Speaker 1:  It was like please in salt lake stuff,

917
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,440
Speaker 4:  Teams, all I'm saying is

918
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,140
Speaker 1:  That growth hacking at its finest.

919
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,700
Speaker 4:  The Microsoft software could have touched Google software. So

920
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,210
Speaker 4:  like something there went wrong. Yeah.

921
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,780
Speaker 1:  Other phone stuff. This 5g story with the

922
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,680
Speaker 1:  FAA is getting more and more complicated by the day.

923
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,370
Speaker 1:  So now the FAA, the FAA was unhappy with the

924
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:43,330
Speaker 1:  FCC and with the telecom companies. So at and

925
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:47,200
Speaker 1:  T and Verizon agreed to delay some of their 5g rollout on

926
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,320
Speaker 1:  certain bands to solve these FAA problems. And now the

927
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,190
Speaker 1:  FAA is saying some flights

928
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:57,190
Speaker 1:  in some weather conditions should not land using instruments

929
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,150
Speaker 1:  alone. If the pilots can see the runway because a

930
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,740
Speaker 1:  5g interference,

931
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,950
Speaker 4:  But then at and T and rice had also promised I think the lower power on airports

932
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:09,220
Speaker 4:  or something, and these slides, these rules only apply to like certain

933
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,910
Speaker 4:  equipment that a lot of people want replaced. Anyway, it's like

934
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:13,870
Speaker 4:  the,

935
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:17,820
Speaker 1:  I will just say this. The, this is, I mean, it's you

936
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,410
Speaker 1:  usually see this for like the FTC and the DOJ, like fighting over. Who's

937
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:24,190
Speaker 1:  going to Sue a big company, the FCC and the FAF, like clearly not

938
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,120
Speaker 1:  talked like the FCC, his entire job is

939
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,020
Speaker 1:  to manage spectrum in this country. Yeah. And yes, like they only just

940
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,710
Speaker 1:  got into heroin dresser, Rosen or Saul was officially confirmed by the Senate

941
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,540
Speaker 1:  like two days ago, but

942
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,750
Speaker 4:  There's still, they're still deadlocked. They don't, there's not the fifth,

943
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,690
Speaker 1:  But they don't need a vote for the stuff. Like the votes that we care about

944
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:46,750
Speaker 1:  that we pay attention to her, like neutral, like a big policy stuff. Yeah.

945
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,320
Speaker 1:  Like mostly the FCC is full of engineers and lawyers whose job it is to just

946
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,220
Speaker 1:  figure this stuff out. Right. And it's nuts that it's, we're this far into

947
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,090
Speaker 1:  the 5g cycle and the FAA is like, oh, there's going to be a

948
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:01,600
Speaker 1:  problem with planes. So like maybe thousands of flights can't

949
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,950
Speaker 1:  land

950
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,070
Speaker 4:  Sometimes when you're in a race, some people get left

951
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:07,930
Speaker 4:  behind.

952
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:11,920
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Anyway, the telecom lobbyists are out of control, mad

953
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,910
Speaker 1:  about this and sort of like the FCC people are, are like, why don't you tell

954
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:19,600
Speaker 1:  us about this earlier? So we'll see what happens, but it's, I don't know.

955
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,380
Speaker 1:  There's something wacky here where like, maybe it was just the race,

956
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,920
Speaker 1:  but in effect, what is happening is the big at and T and

957
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,670
Speaker 1:  Verizon mid band roll-outs are being affected by the FAA.

958
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:34,210
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And we'll just see where that goes. Did you see this horizon

959
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,680
Speaker 1:  story?

960
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,310
Speaker 4:  Yes. And it's like this, this is my PSA

961
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:43,300
Speaker 4:  moment. So there's this thing where Verizon has Verizon already

962
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,170
Speaker 4:  had this program called like Verizon, like up or something where it was really

963
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,620
Speaker 4:  obvious that signing up for this to get a deal is definitely going to sign

964
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:54,400
Speaker 4:  you up to have them collect more data, but they're doing it. And even skeezy

965
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,120
Speaker 4:  your way now with Verizon custom experience and custom experience

966
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,300
Speaker 4:  plus, and it seems

967
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,160
Speaker 1:  Rational shaking his head.

968
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,030
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's like, come on. I mean, Verizon, you know, famous

969
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:10,900
Speaker 4:  adventure of the super cookie, right? Yeah. What I believe is happening

970
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,650
Speaker 4:  here is Verizon and a bunch of other companies are

971
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,340
Speaker 4:  tr there's a story about the secretary, or they're turning the knob up on

972
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:22,220
Speaker 4:  all of their, like customer loyalty programs and of their like, you

973
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:26,210
Speaker 4:  know, sign up and give us some piece of information program to

974
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:29,240
Speaker 4:  as high as they can go right now, in

975
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,050
Speaker 4:  case the stuff with app tracking on iPhones

976
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:36,710
Speaker 4:  and, you know, Chrome decides it's going to finally do something with flock.

977
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:39,650
Speaker 4:  Although my money is on, they're going to waffle for an extra two Mo two

978
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:43,580
Speaker 4:  years. You know, if the cookie apocalypse happens

979
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,520
Speaker 4:  or if you know something with app tracking gets shut down, there was a weird

980
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,300
Speaker 4:  story where like apple was maybe letting people collect data on, you know,

981
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,050
Speaker 4:  iPhone apps, blah, blah, blah. All of this stuff is really frothy right

982
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:58,040
Speaker 4:  now, but like just don't sign up for anything. That's that's

983
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,240
Speaker 4:  my advice to you.

984
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,140
Speaker 1:  So the specific thing Dieter was talking about was for the Verizon super

985
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,770
Speaker 1:  cookie ages ago was for Verizon at the network

986
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,400
Speaker 1:  level would just track everything you did on the web, using something called

987
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,250
Speaker 1:  the super cookie and you couldn't get rid of it. And if you had a Verizon

988
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,040
Speaker 1:  phone, they were just building this profile of you. Everyone got mad, they

989
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,980
Speaker 1:  turned off. I'm telling you that this is evidence that they're bringing it

990
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,910
Speaker 1:  back. Yeah, no for sure. Like Verizon's entire media strategy. Remember

991
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:26,390
Speaker 1:  they bought AOL and Yahoo and they merged them into a company

992
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:30,110
Speaker 1:  called I spun out and now

993
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:33,980
Speaker 1:  yeah, the Yahoo got spun off again. And they just renamed

994
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,820
Speaker 1:  Verizon media. The company that was known as Verizon media

995
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:41,720
Speaker 1:  is now just known is Yahoo ad tech. Like

996
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,590
Speaker 1:  no, no hiding the ball. Like the corporate entity

997
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:49,160
Speaker 1:  that owns like tech crunch and gadget, which are great sites and run by great

998
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,760
Speaker 1:  people. But like that corporate entity is now just known as Yahoo ad tech,

999
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,600
Speaker 1:  like zero hiding the ball, what they're doing. So now,

1000
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,590
Speaker 1:  because apps can't track their data on the phone for

1001
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:04,430
Speaker 1:  Isen can track your data on the network. Correct.

1002
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,130
Speaker 3:  And you've opted in because it's your

1003
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,720
Speaker 3:  carrier,

1004
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,660
Speaker 1:  Right? You've just signed whatever contracts you got a free phone. So Ryzen

1005
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,570
Speaker 1:  has all this data about where you are, what your traffic is doing, what your

1006
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:18,290
Speaker 1:  interests are with websites are going to, and then they can then flip

1007
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:22,130
Speaker 1:  that into ad tracking profiles. Yep. And bypass

1008
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,300
Speaker 1:  all of that.

1009
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,260
Speaker 3:  The thing that throws a wrench in this is private relay is, is

1010
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,160
Speaker 3:  iClouds, VPN type thing. It's not a VPN, but we'll

1011
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,790
Speaker 3:  call it that. And it's almost like apple saw this coming. This is like

1012
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:38,720
Speaker 3:  fighting at what, how low in the stack of like the ability

1013
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,710
Speaker 3:  to block out a tracking, can you get apples pretty down there, but then there's

1014
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:46,070
Speaker 3:  Verizon. It's like, well actually we can just sniff all your packets. And

1015
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,830
Speaker 3:  then Apple's like, well, hold on, we're going to put a wall up. So you can't.

1016
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:52,790
Speaker 3:  So I have a feeling this won't work is around about way of

1017
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:53,720
Speaker 3:  saying that,

1018
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,500
Speaker 1:  Oh, I mean carrier software ideas. That's a good bet. Yeah.

1019
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,130
Speaker 1:  But like both, this is what H and T wanted to do with Warner

1020
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,610
Speaker 1:  media. Like their stated purpose for buying Warner

1021
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:05,780
Speaker 1:  brothers, which is just

1022
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,800
Speaker 3:  Ridiculous to think

1023
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,760
Speaker 1:  About ad tracking in advertising. There is just a

1024
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,540
Speaker 1:  study like where there is a bunch of STC noise lately because of Rosenworcel.

1025
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,260
Speaker 1:  And then Judy Stone is up for the other commissioner spots, a break, the

1026
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,870
Speaker 1:  two to tie. And I think we talked about this

1027
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,770
Speaker 1:  with Russell last week. I don't know. I'll just recapitulate it. So GG

1028
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:29,760
Speaker 1:  sound is up for the last spot in the FCC. Yup. And

1029
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,700
Speaker 1:  Fox news in the wall street journal don't want her to be on the FCC, but

1030
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,090
Speaker 1:  OANN Newsmax do because she supports

1031
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:39,510
Speaker 1:  competition just like as a principal. And they're the competitors, which

1032
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:42,750
Speaker 1:  is very funny. But so there's all this noise where the sec, but if you look

1033
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,940
Speaker 1:  at investment in networks, themselves, capital expenditure

1034
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:49,590
Speaker 1:  networks, when they got rid of net neutrality, the actual net

1035
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:53,430
Speaker 1:  investment in networks went down because all of the broadband companies started

1036
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:57,360
Speaker 1:  buying media. They went and bought Warner media and they went and

1037
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,290
Speaker 1:  bought AOL. They did all this stuff because

1038
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,510
Speaker 1:  they were like, we're going to monetize what happens on the networks as we

1039
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:06,780
Speaker 1:  can see the networks. And then all of a sudden he is we're inevitably

1040
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:10,740
Speaker 1:  bad. So I would just say like this, you can

1041
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:14,310
Speaker 1:  see what's happening. Like apple turned off the cookie stuff. They turned

1042
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:17,910
Speaker 1:  off tracking. And now everyone else who has the ability to track is like

1043
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:21,780
Speaker 1:  lit this idea back up, Alex, you cover like a bunch of, you know, like snap

1044
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:25,590
Speaker 1:  had like bad earnings, but this is like hitting these companies in serious

1045
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:26,040
Speaker 1:  ways.

1046
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean, what's effectively happening is it's it's a lot of it is

1047
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,180
Speaker 3:  apple in the private sector. A lot of is actually coming from the

1048
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:37,020
Speaker 3:  EU in the public sector. So between apple and the EU and

1049
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:40,680
Speaker 3:  then Google, whatever the hell they're going to do, you effectively, you

1050
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,190
Speaker 3:  could think of the internet today. It is like a, a big series of

1051
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:48,060
Speaker 3:  interlocking webs, right? Where it was pretty easy for X company

1052
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:51,780
Speaker 3:  to sell it, sell data to another, or even just tell them,

1053
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,620
Speaker 3:  Hey, like we think this person is this and they corroborate what's happening

1054
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:59,430
Speaker 3:  is apple in the U with this digital market service act, that's coming

1055
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:03,330
Speaker 3:  out sometime or just taking scissors and cutting all those webs. And so

1056
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:07,140
Speaker 3:  everything is becoming siloed and we're in this

1057
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,130
Speaker 3:  like kind of adjustment, painful adjustment period, mostly brought on

1058
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,910
Speaker 3:  by apple right now. But like the things that Facebook is doing where it's,

1059
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:18,180
Speaker 3:  you know, getting rid of ad targeting options, you know, where you can't,

1060
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,050
Speaker 3:  you no longer can target somebody by based on their sexual orientation. That's

1061
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:25,740
Speaker 3:  actually motivated by laws that are coming in the EU that are just

1062
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:29,670
Speaker 3:  clamping down on targeting from a legal perspective. And

1063
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:33,010
Speaker 3:  so, yeah, everyone's building these, there's a guy named Eric Sue for it

1064
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:36,540
Speaker 3:  is like a super smart ad tech guy who calls them content fortresses. But

1065
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:40,140
Speaker 3:  every app and I wrote this in a 10 year kind of package,

1066
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:44,040
Speaker 3:  like every app is going to become a super app where like, instead of you

1067
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,730
Speaker 3:  going off app to purchase something, Facebook wants you to do

1068
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:51,570
Speaker 3:  shopping on Instagram because when you shop on Instagram, they know you

1069
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:54,510
Speaker 3:  bought it. Whereas if they kick you off to a website, there's no more cookie

1070
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:58,230
Speaker 3:  for them to say, oh, they came from our ad. Therefore our ad worked. And

1071
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:02,010
Speaker 3:  so this is going to reshape big parts of the internet for

1072
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,860
Speaker 3:  sure. And it already is starting to do that. Yeah.

1073
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:08,850
Speaker 4:  I'm just going to put an idea out there if you're, I'm sure an apple

1074
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:12,540
Speaker 4:  engineer just wants you to pull over in your car, think about this

1075
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:16,350
Speaker 4:  problem of these super apps and everyone trying to keep people inside their

1076
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:20,170
Speaker 4:  apps, take a deep breath and realize in your heart

1077
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,980
Speaker 4:  that allowing at browsers was a mistake and you should

1078
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:27,430
Speaker 4:  turn them off on your platform. And that browsers are the

1079
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:31,150
Speaker 4:  worst. Give me my tabs. Give me my

1080
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,880
Speaker 4:  browser. Give me my extensions. Give

1081
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,840
Speaker 4:  me my own space where I'm a control away visit on the

1082
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,800
Speaker 4:  web. And don't make me bounce from the Twitter

1083
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,310
Speaker 4:  browser to safari. Don't make me relogging

1084
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:49,270
Speaker 4:  in to the New York times. So I can read an article 15

1085
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:52,150
Speaker 4:  times and every single app that happens to link to the New York times,

1086
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,050
Speaker 1:  Just send them all to

1087
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:56,140
Speaker 4:  Safari. This isn't a problem on, on Chrome because they share cookies with

1088
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:59,500
Speaker 4:  the enterprisers, but still I'm just saying ban in at

1089
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,980
Speaker 4:  browsers and you will go a long way towards solving this super app tracking

1090
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:03,760
Speaker 4:  problem. Just do it.

1091
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,630
Speaker 1:  We'll end up back in court tomorrow.

1092
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,020
Speaker 1:  It's like, it's like the death now. Okay. Other letting around

1093
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:14,320
Speaker 1:  stuff Adam Maseri had of Instagram was in front of

1094
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,280
Speaker 1:  Congress. Facebook's or just set up shop in DC at this point

1095
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:21,560
Speaker 1:  and move all their executives. There are Mehta, I'm sorry, Metta, but it's

1096
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,310
Speaker 1:  first time for Adam in front of Congress. He said, they're bringing back

1097
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,380
Speaker 1:  the chronological feed. What'd you think of the,

1098
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,830
Speaker 3:  Oh my God. I mean, how many more of these are we going to have? It's like,

1099
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:33,730
Speaker 3:  you know, forever Casey had a great tweet about how, you know, it's like

1100
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:37,690
Speaker 3:  they just legislate through hearings, right? Like nothing actually happens.

1101
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:41,590
Speaker 3:  And it's all just a bunch of grand standing. I mean, I think I

1102
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:44,680
Speaker 3:  tuned out of this hearing after like half of it, because it was

1103
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,670
Speaker 3:  just, it's just incomprehensible. And it's like, you can just tell that

1104
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:52,000
Speaker 3:  this is all, it's all politically motivated. Like all of a sudden, all the

1105
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,990
Speaker 3:  senators care about our kids. And it's like, you know,

1106
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:59,800
Speaker 3:  it's all Metis fault. And obviously there are problems here. I'm not trying

1107
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,250
Speaker 3:  to absolve them of all responsibility, but I just wish there was actual

1108
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:07,120
Speaker 3:  more. I come back to like the fact that like the

1109
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,540
Speaker 3:  honest ads act, which is a response to

1110
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:14,500
Speaker 3:  2016, like literally never happened. And it was like

1111
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,130
Speaker 3:  the only thing that managed to even like get some

1112
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:22,090
Speaker 3:  kind of interest in Congress. And yeah, I

1113
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:25,810
Speaker 3:  just, I don't know. I don't think the American public really thinks these

1114
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:29,740
Speaker 3:  hearings are interesting or working. Like I would be shocked.

1115
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,010
Speaker 3:  I just don't really know who they're for except for donors and the

1116
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:36,640
Speaker 3:  media. And then when most serious says we're bringing chronological

1117
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,850
Speaker 3:  feedback. That's the actual news out of the entire, whatever, two or three

1118
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,090
Speaker 3:  hour hearing, it was like Instagram bringing back this thing they killed

1119
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:46,360
Speaker 3:  for no reason. I mean, it, wasn't no reason, but that people hated that they

1120
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,480
Speaker 3:  killed years ago. So

1121
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,260
Speaker 4:  It's next year it comes, sorry. Twitter moved faster than

1122
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:55,870
Speaker 4:  Twitter. If you can't move as fast as Twitter, what are you

1123
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:56,500
Speaker 4:  doing?

1124
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,240
Speaker 3:  Well, you know, they're going through a lot over there. Okay. You know, they've

1125
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,090
Speaker 3:  got a lot of people in the metaverse

1126
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:07,180
Speaker 3:  it's funny because like that's Francis Haugen, you know, if the Facebook

1127
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:10,300
Speaker 3:  whistleblower, that was her whole thing, that her, her stump speech, when

1128
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:14,140
Speaker 3:  she came out and was like ban algorithms, like the chronological feed will

1129
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:17,660
Speaker 3:  fix integrity on the internet. And we're going to see if that

1130
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,440
Speaker 3:  works. And I would not be shocked if like,

1131
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,250
Speaker 3:  most people don't even use this when it comes out. I don't think Twitter's

1132
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:28,680
Speaker 3:  chronological feed is heavily used and that's what I use.

1133
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,130
Speaker 1:  So it

1134
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:32,960
Speaker 3:  Is. Wow. Yeah, of course, man, I used to be a Twitter completion as two.

1135
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,960
Speaker 1:  So I mean, my entire thing is at Twitter, poisons your brain and then we

1136
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,860
Speaker 1:  should all quit. So if I intentionally make my Twitter

1137
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,690
Speaker 1:  experience as broken as possible,

1138
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:44,300
Speaker 3:  That's fair. I mean, I remember being a tweet bot stand and like having to

1139
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:47,240
Speaker 3:  read every single tweet in my feed, because it would show you the counter

1140
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,900
Speaker 3:  before you can refresh. And I'm really glad those days are behind

1141
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:54,350
Speaker 3:  me. But yeah, I don't know this whole, like, should we all be

1142
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:57,410
Speaker 3:  chronological feeds or should we be algorithms? And I

1143
01:08:57,410 --> 01:09:01,400
Speaker 3:  just, I don't know, they're doing this to appease the, the, the angry

1144
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,890
Speaker 3:  senators who, who care about our children. So

1145
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,340
Speaker 1:  I think that the angry senators you're correct about donors, but I think

1146
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:10,460
Speaker 1:  it does get them voters yelling at Metta or Facebook or

1147
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,790
Speaker 1:  Instagram is like, it works for both

1148
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:14,750
Speaker 1:  parties

1149
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:18,590
Speaker 3:  Because the Republicans need like suburban women or what's, what's the,

1150
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:22,430
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I, I think there's that. I like, I think this next year, you

1151
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:26,240
Speaker 1:  know how it is testifying, there's assuming

1152
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,990
Speaker 1:  this next chunk of the Biden plan passes, which who knows if it, well, the

1153
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:33,200
Speaker 1:  next set of attention is gonna be back on. So two 30 in social media regulation,

1154
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,130
Speaker 1:  like we've heard both parties say they want to do it and there there's going

1155
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:41,090
Speaker 1:  to be some meaningful, oh shit. The first amendments in

1156
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:44,000
Speaker 1:  our way. It's just coming for them till we say this

1157
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,840
Speaker 3:  Every year though, that it's coming. Like, again, I come back to

1158
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:51,440
Speaker 3:  like the honest ads act, which was like a smart piece of like

1159
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:55,400
Speaker 3:  detailed niche focus legislation about like political

1160
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,360
Speaker 3:  ads. Like that went nowhere. So, I mean, you really think

1161
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,360
Speaker 3:  we're going to get to like meaningful section two 30 reform in a divided

1162
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,200
Speaker 3:  Congress.

1163
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,530
Speaker 1:  I think what's going to happen is the, the Florida social media

1164
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:10,490
Speaker 1:  bill will work its way through the courts. Right? It got stayed. The Texas

1165
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:14,480
Speaker 1:  social media bill got stayed. Like as those things move

1166
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,350
Speaker 1:  their way through the courts are gonna, and Congress like

1167
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,230
Speaker 1:  turns as in selection year, they're all going to start yelling about it.

1168
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:24,890
Speaker 1:  Like it's just easy money for a politician to be like Facebook as

1169
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:28,490
Speaker 1:  bad. Sure. It's it's just like, it's easy to be like, YouTube is poisoning

1170
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,490
Speaker 1:  our kids. We got to do something about it. If you reelect me to the United

1171
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:34,910
Speaker 1:  States, Congress, my bill will make YouTube, not sensor conservatives.

1172
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:38,730
Speaker 1:  Like I could probably win a seat in upstate New York

1173
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:42,230
Speaker 1:  right tomorrow. If I just like ran around saying that like it's

1174
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:45,590
Speaker 1:  convincing to a lot of people, for reasons that make sense,

1175
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:49,460
Speaker 1:  like people do not have great relationships with these platforms.

1176
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,150
Speaker 3:  The nurse did in our survey say that, say that a little differently.

1177
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:56,930
Speaker 1:  They said they like the utility platforms. So

1178
01:10:56,930 --> 01:11:00,830
Speaker 1:  Google, Facebook, YouTube, which is a not

1179
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:04,220
Speaker 1:  Facebook. So Google and Amazon really, really highly rated whether they provide

1180
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:07,700
Speaker 1:  an ongoing utility. I was like 98% approval in our

1181
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,570
Speaker 1:  survey. YouTube way up there, because look, my

1182
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:15,150
Speaker 1:  refrigerator's broke. I watched a lot of yesterday trying to fix it. I failed.

1183
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:16,860
Speaker 1:  So now my opinion of YouTube is very

1184
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:20,190
Speaker 1:  low. As you break it

1185
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:23,730
Speaker 1:  further, my father-in-law's here and he has spent the entire day just like

1186
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:27,390
Speaker 1:  tearing this thing to shreds. Oh boy, is it something to do? It's 15 years

1187
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,720
Speaker 1:  old. The thing is that it's, it's not going to happen. Supply chain crunches

1188
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,480
Speaker 1:  real though, buy a new refrigerator right now. It's a real problem. Anyhow,

1189
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,900
Speaker 1:  those are all the top. And then you get to Facebook and Instagram and Twitter.

1190
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,560
Speaker 1:  And there are people like I'm way less. And I, I just think that's like

1191
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,130
Speaker 1:  easy money for politicians. I think it's coming. Something is the, some

1192
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:47,880
Speaker 1:  conversation is coming and right at the center of it

1193
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,870
Speaker 1:  is a theme park, a theme park. Either

1194
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:55,440
Speaker 1:  our government is going to tell, tell itself that the first

1195
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,310
Speaker 1:  amendment keeps it from regulating social networks, which is what

1196
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:03,240
Speaker 1:  the judicial branch has currently telling legislative branches,

1197
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,510
Speaker 1:  or that's going to change. Like those are the only two options we're going

1198
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,550
Speaker 1:  to change the constitution.

1199
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:12,480
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think that conversation is

1200
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,110
Speaker 1:  coming in a serious way next year. I do. And not in the they'll pass a

1201
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:19,980
Speaker 1:  law, but in the two states have now made a run at it and run

1202
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:23,280
Speaker 1:  directly into the first amendment. And they're going to the, those lawsuits

1203
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,490
Speaker 1:  are going to wind their way through the courts. Next year, last few things.

1204
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:30,450
Speaker 1:  Speaking of lawsuits, epic V apple, the deadline

1205
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:34,170
Speaker 1:  for apple to allow links to external payments.

1206
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:34,470
Speaker 1:  And

1207
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:37,950
Speaker 4:  What about, what about meta buttons?

1208
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:41,490
Speaker 1:  The deadline for apple to metaverse buttons to two other

1209
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:45,360
Speaker 1:  payments. It was going to come, but the appeals court, which is

1210
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,230
Speaker 1:  unusual, the appeals court, granted a stay saying

1211
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:52,980
Speaker 1:  apple had raised serious issues about the ruling in the district court. That's

1212
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:56,520
Speaker 1:  on hold. What I will remind you is that skipping to the

1213
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,970
Speaker 1:  end of a legal process is not

1214
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:03,910
Speaker 1:  correct. Like, like they issued the stay.

1215
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:06,210
Speaker 1:  That doesn't mean apple one. It means I have to appeal. And it means when

1216
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:09,840
Speaker 1:  that's done the, you know, there's an epic V Google

1217
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,530
Speaker 1:  exists too. So then are going to be two cases that get

1218
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:17,310
Speaker 1:  appealed, which usually means you

1219
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,970
Speaker 1:  get another appeal. And that might mean you get a Supreme court

1220
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:24,270
Speaker 1:  case, right? And ethics law firm

1221
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:27,630
Speaker 1:  famously represented Amex against a bunch of retailers

1222
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:30,990
Speaker 1:  lost at every level until they got to assume Supreme court in

1223
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,680
Speaker 1:  one, in an antitrust case about merchant payments.

1224
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,280
Speaker 1:  So I'm not saying apple is gonna win. I'm not saying Amex and lose. I'm just

1225
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,840
Speaker 1:  saying don't skip to the end.

1226
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,680
Speaker 4:  The one important thing, the state does not appear to apply to

1227
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:47,550
Speaker 4:  apps, being allowed to admit that payment systems outside the app store

1228
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:51,390
Speaker 4:  exist. So they can't link to it. But like,

1229
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:53,820
Speaker 1:  And apple, I think Apple's already bent on this. Right. They bent on it in

1230
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,970
Speaker 1:  Japan. They're not interested in fighting that. Yeah.

1231
01:13:56,970 --> 01:14:00,660
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So like that to me was always one of the most egregious things.

1232
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:03,900
Speaker 4:  So I hope that goes away with a quickness.

1233
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,770
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Samsung, I didn't realize this had already

1234
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:11,140
Speaker 1:  happened. They've merged their mobile and consumer electronics businesses.

1235
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:11,470
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I

1236
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:14,620
Speaker 4:  Mean, I see this as a function of the mobile businesses, a hurting unit,

1237
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:18,400
Speaker 4:  like, like literally the business units is hurting

1238
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,360
Speaker 1:  It's finally, which is like, is an Android phone.

1239
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:26,080
Speaker 1:  Like what's a, what's a, what's the T what's a TV. It's a giant Android phone.

1240
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,950
Speaker 4:  But like the TV people are in charge. Yeah. So like, this is either

1241
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:33,650
Speaker 4:  just not a big deal or it's like, I don't know. The Sony

1242
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:36,760
Speaker 4:  reification of the voice Samsung makes phones, which is like a scary thought

1243
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,000
Speaker 4:  because Sony has not been great at phones. Anyway. I don't think we can read

1244
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,690
Speaker 4:  too much into it yet. It might just be crazy Samsung

1245
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:47,530
Speaker 4:  company politics. But I do think that it may mean

1246
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,800
Speaker 4:  some like changes to the way that like they've been cranking out

1247
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,370
Speaker 4:  phones. I think that there might be in theory,

1248
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:58,240
Speaker 4:  maybe if we're lucky, some more coherency there, but who knows?

1249
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1250
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,690
Speaker 1:  As the person who in the market for a refrigerator, I'll say that I played

1251
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:05,350
Speaker 1:  with the Samsung smart fridge. Yeah. At the store

1252
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:09,340
Speaker 1:  yesterday, man, putting a slow mid range. Android tablet on the front of

1253
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,730
Speaker 1:  the refrigerator is not the compelling idea. You thought it was

1254
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,990
Speaker 1:  new.

1255
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:16,930
Speaker 3:  I'd be like, you need a high-tech refrigerator. So you are going to come

1256
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:18,250
Speaker 3:  to see us.

1257
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:21,880
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I'm pretty sad that I won't be doing the refrigerator tour at

1258
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,080
Speaker 1:  CS

1259
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,290
Speaker 4:  One with like a curved screen of what the Android tablet. So you can get

1260
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:28,480
Speaker 4:  a curved TV refrigerator in your house

1261
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:32,200
Speaker 1:  House. Do you want to do an hour on refrigerator since I'm in it right now,

1262
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,900
Speaker 1:  deep in the game, do you know where you're on? The antitrust regulators in

1263
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,840
Speaker 1:  this country need to turn their attention? There's like three appliance

1264
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,330
Speaker 1:  manufacturers. They all are

1265
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:42,010
Speaker 4:  Samsung, LG

1266
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:45,940
Speaker 1:  There's Samsung and LG. And then there is a higher which on this GE and

1267
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:49,360
Speaker 1:  there's Whirlpool, which owns everything else. Gotcha. Okay. That's a

1268
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,200
Speaker 1:  real throw mess. Also a appliance forums, just a

1269
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,810
Speaker 1:  hotbed of internet activity. There's a whole world here. We're not paying

1270
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:58,510
Speaker 1:  attention to

1271
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:58,990
Speaker 4:  Running on

1272
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:02,770
Speaker 1:  Vivo. Yeah, man. You want to, you want to see misinformation at work. You

1273
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:05,890
Speaker 1:  ask people about LGS refrigerator compressors and whether they're

1274
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:08,950
Speaker 1:  reliable. All

1275
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:12,370
Speaker 1:  right. Last few things. There was a really dumb story

1276
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:16,060
Speaker 1:  about the vice president and her wired headphones.

1277
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:19,750
Speaker 1:  Just Corrine. Fave is our new senior security reporter. He wrote a very

1278
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:23,650
Speaker 1:  pessimistic. I read that, but long story short it's okay. If

1279
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:27,550
Speaker 1:  the most powerful people in the government don't have wireless radios that

1280
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:31,450
Speaker 1:  intrinsically serve as location beacons turned on, we gotta read that

1281
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:35,170
Speaker 1:  and then send a sense, a plan to make its products more repairable, which

1282
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:38,800
Speaker 1:  is interesting. That that is becoming a thing. Microsoft announced the

1283
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,760
Speaker 1:  plan in a sense, a plan like apple just did that big right to repair

1284
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:46,600
Speaker 1:  stuff. That movement is regardless of the legislation, there's proposed

1285
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,500
Speaker 1:  legislation. Alex, I know it might not ever happen. Regardless of that,

1286
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,130
Speaker 1:  the market is demanding repairability and the companies are starting to realize

1287
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:55,870
Speaker 1:  they can sell it.

1288
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:58,540
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Well, especially if you're apple and you already made your products

1289
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:02,410
Speaker 3:  on repairable, why not just give someone a fix it kit and say,

1290
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:03,760
Speaker 3:  go for a kid.

1291
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,060
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So I was spiky about this on Twitter. I said it was a right to repair

1292
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,850
Speaker 4:  equivalent of greenwashing because they didn't have any details about repair

1293
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:13,220
Speaker 4:  manuals or offering to sell replacement parts or

1294
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:17,210
Speaker 4:  whatever Sonos has emailed me. And they're, they're not happy with my

1295
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:21,200
Speaker 4:  spiky tweet even a little. So I just, for the record, want to

1296
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:25,130
Speaker 4:  say that a spokesperson, Tom lodged lets me know that I

1297
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:28,520
Speaker 4:  want to assure you, this is a real plan with significant work already

1298
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,090
Speaker 4:  undertaken on products we will release. And

1299
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,700
Speaker 4:  that we continue to work through the details of how we're going to manage

1300

1301
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,270
Speaker 4:  consulting with organizations active in this space. For example, I fix
