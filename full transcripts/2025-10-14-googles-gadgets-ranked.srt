Description: Google is on a bit of a heater when it comes to gadgets. The Pixel 10 lineup is one of the best Android phone options; the Pixel Watch 4 is suddenly a winner; the Pixel Buds are an excellent accessory; even the Pixel Fold got some welcome upgrades this year! With the help of The Verge’s Victoria Song and Allison Johnson, we do the impossible: we rank all six of Google’s Pixel gadgets, from worst to best. Are headphones better than smartphones? Can you really compare a tablet to a smartwatch? Who knows, but we try. After that, Allison and David answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about whether the dumbphone movement is a real one.

00:00:02,115 --> 00:00:05,885
Speaker 3:  Welcome to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the Google Pixel book.

3
00:00:06,305 --> 00:00:10,165
Speaker 3:  My maybe favorite computer of all time that is now long gone and

4
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:13,565
Speaker 3:  Google refuses to keep making new ones. We're not gonna talk at all about

5
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:17,525
Speaker 3:  the Pixel book on this episode, but I miss it dearly. And I just, I Pixel

6
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:21,445
Speaker 3:  book. If you're out there, just know that I loved you anyway. I'm your friend

7
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:25,365
Speaker 3:  David Pierce, and today on the podcast we're gonna do something a little

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,285
Speaker 3:  new. We have a bunch of Google reviews over the last few days and really

9
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:33,045
Speaker 3:  the last couple of months. And we've seen a theme among the Google reviews,

10
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:36,485
Speaker 3:  which is that they're all very good. Google made some good gadgets. So we're

11
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:39,605
Speaker 3:  gonna talk about Google's good gadgets and then

12
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:43,155
Speaker 3:  we're gonna play a little bit of a new game about them and see if we can

13
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:47,075
Speaker 3:  figure out which of Google's good new gadgets is the best of

14
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:50,435
Speaker 3:  Google's good. New gadgets. It's gonna be a good time. All that is coming

15
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:54,235
Speaker 3:  up in just a second. But first I just realized I have three pairs of

16
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:58,075
Speaker 3:  headphones connected to my computer right now and I need to go disconnect

17
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,835
Speaker 3:  those before something horrible happens. This is the first cast, we'll be

18
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:01,115
Speaker 3:  right back.

19
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:33,795
Speaker 3:  Alright, we're back. Let's talk Google. Allison Johnson's here. Hi Allison.

20
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,275
Speaker 3:  Hello V Song and many cats. Hello,

21
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:38,475
Speaker 6:  Hello.

22
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:43,015
Speaker 3:  V for the folks on YouTube teach us about the cats.

23
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:43,735
Speaker 3:  Who are the cats?

24
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:47,855
Speaker 6:  This is Petey. He is the, the younger baby cat and

25
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,855
Speaker 6:  he loves to disrupt my work, hence why I bought a cat bed

26
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:55,535
Speaker 6:  that attaches to my desk so he can feel like he's part

27
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:59,505
Speaker 6:  of my day while staying out of the way. I love

28
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:03,465
Speaker 6:  that. And then back here we have my big boy Pablo, who

29
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:04,785
Speaker 6:  is currently taking a nap.

30
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:08,865
Speaker 3:  It's the dream, this is the life. Alright, I have, I have brought you guys

31
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:11,745
Speaker 3:  here because I want to try a new thing that I've been wanting to do for a

32
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:15,345
Speaker 3:  while. But first all three of us reviewed Google products this week

33
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:19,465
Speaker 3:  and I just wanna, I want to quickly breeze through them because

34
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:23,145
Speaker 3:  they all have in common that they're all very good and they're all very good

35
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:26,705
Speaker 3:  in kind of the same way, which I think is really fun and really interesting.

36
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:30,545
Speaker 3:  So Alice, I'm gonna start with you. You reviewed the Google Pixel

37
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:33,865
Speaker 3:  10 pro fold, the worst name phone in phones

38
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:38,425
Speaker 3:  and really liked it, I would say for like the one big specific

39
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:40,625
Speaker 3:  reason you really liked it, right? Yeah.

40
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:44,865
Speaker 7:  You can kind of boil down the changes to two major things. One

41
00:03:44,865 --> 00:03:48,105
Speaker 7:  is the new hinge, which is hard to tell from the outside, but

42
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:52,545
Speaker 7:  you can appreciate it in certain ways. And they

43
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:56,585
Speaker 7:  added qi support with the magnets and everything.

44
00:03:56,645 --> 00:04:00,425
Speaker 7:  So you have like MagSafe, which I loved. Yeah.

45
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:04,225
Speaker 7:  But the main update here is that this is the first

46
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:08,225
Speaker 7:  folding phone with an IP 68 rating, meaning it is fully

47
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:12,065
Speaker 7:  dust resistant. This is not existed on any folding phone

48
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:15,825
Speaker 7:  in the past. And it's important for a folding phone because

49
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:20,225
Speaker 7:  dust getting into the hinge can, you know, it can move under the screen

50
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:24,305
Speaker 7:  and then the screen is toast. It's, it's ugly and

51
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,225
Speaker 7:  it's been kind of a thing that prohibits me from, or I don't

52
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:31,785
Speaker 7:  feel good recommending these phones to people. They're $2,000,

53
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:36,105
Speaker 7:  right? Single grain of dust can bring it down. But

54
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:40,065
Speaker 7:  I took Google at its word. I brought the phone

55
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:44,265
Speaker 7:  to the beach, like air quotes. We have a beach in

56
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:47,545
Speaker 7:  Seattle, it's manmade, but there's

57
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:51,905
Speaker 7:  plenty of sand. And I set the thing

58
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:55,665
Speaker 7:  down to take a photo of it on the sand thinking

59
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:59,545
Speaker 7:  it would just kind of like gracefully sit on top of the

60
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:02,905
Speaker 7:  sand, you know, propped up against a log and all this. Yeah.

61
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:06,185
Speaker 3:  VV is making the face for anyone not watching this V is making the face that

62
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:09,185
Speaker 3:  I feel in my bones. Yeah. Right now. Which is, this is true

63
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:10,865
Speaker 3:  psychopath behavior.

64
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:14,385
Speaker 7:  It was not, that's not how it works. Yeah. It

65
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:17,585
Speaker 3:  Just, let me, let me just put this new gadget down on the sand. It'll probably

66
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:21,025
Speaker 3:  be fine. Yeah, it is like the last words of reviewer ever since. And

67
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:24,185
Speaker 7:  I open, yeah, I had it unfolded, of course. 'cause you wanna do that,

68
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:29,585
Speaker 7:  set it down on the sand, just sank immediately, like half

69
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:31,225
Speaker 7:  an inch down sand.

70
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:32,305
Speaker 6:  That's how sand works.

71
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:33,145
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

72
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:34,265
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Who would

73
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:38,185
Speaker 7:  Exactly. Yeah. Which all came back to me as

74
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:42,065
Speaker 7:  I watched the sand work its way, you know how it's like immediately

75
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:45,945
Speaker 7:  everywhere it was around the, the corners of the screen. It was up

76
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:49,665
Speaker 7:  in the hinge, it was in the back of the hinge. I was like, well, I'm committed

77
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,065
Speaker 7:  to this. And I just took my photos.

78
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:56,505
Speaker 7:  I, I picked it up and I was like opening and closing it. There was

79
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:59,765
Speaker 7:  a crunching sound coming from there. No,

80
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:04,645
Speaker 7:  it was crunching. And I was like, oh god. And

81
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:08,525
Speaker 7:  then I was like, why not? Then set it

82
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:12,355
Speaker 7:  next to the water and get a picture of the phone

83
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:16,315
Speaker 7:  with the waves gently, like, you know, coming

84
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:20,555
Speaker 7:  ashore and not touching the phone. So I

85
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:24,475
Speaker 7:  did, I set it down next to like a seashell in a little piece

86
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:27,915
Speaker 7:  of seaweed and I was like, I'll just be able to grab it outta the way if

87
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:30,915
Speaker 7:  a wave comes. That's not how it works. So

88
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:35,595
Speaker 7:  wave like came and got about halfway over

89
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:40,115
Speaker 7:  the unfolded folding phone and I snatched it

90
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:44,075
Speaker 7:  up and I was like, I have to call Google now and tell them

91
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:47,155
Speaker 7:  their phone is busted. Like this is it.

92
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:52,035
Speaker 7:  Boy, I killed it. But the, it, it's fine.

93
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,835
Speaker 7:  I, I did take it like, you know, I tried it off. I got any of the

94
00:06:56,835 --> 00:07:00,795
Speaker 7:  sand I could, I could see out of it when I got home, I

95
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,635
Speaker 7:  used some of the compressed air to like get rid of the rest of

96
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:08,315
Speaker 7:  the sand. And it was fine after that. And I'm, it's still

97
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:08,635
Speaker 7:  going.

98
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:12,235
Speaker 3:  It was the best feeling in the world when you just pick it up and you like

99
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:14,635
Speaker 3:  touch the screen and you like, you jiggle some stuff around just to see if

100
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,755
Speaker 3:  it's also working. You're like, oh, oh, it's, it's, it's fine. Yeah. My phone

101
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:21,555
Speaker 3:  is fine. Yeah. That is like the, the relief that comes at that moment

102
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:24,995
Speaker 3:  is so spectacular. Yeah. I cannot even describe.

103
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:29,315
Speaker 7:  Yes, I, I felt that I felt $1,800 worth of

104
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:30,395
Speaker 7:  that worth, worth,

105
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:33,195
Speaker 3:  Worth. Well I'm thrilled for you. I also like imagining the call to Google

106
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:37,115
Speaker 3:  where you're like, hi, so I buried your phone in the sand

107
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:40,675
Speaker 3:  and then I essentially threw it in the ocean and now it's broken. I'm so

108
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:40,875
Speaker 3:  sorry.

109
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:45,075
Speaker 7:  You're like, oops, sorry guys. It turns out you're not supposed to do

110
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:45,955
Speaker 7:  that. But I

111
00:07:45,955 --> 00:07:47,395
Speaker 3:  Did it for journalism, you know,

112
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:51,235
Speaker 7:  I, I did it for the blog, but you know, oh, it survived. I

113
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:51,515
Speaker 7:  I

114
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:56,225
Speaker 6:  Were you wearing the Pixel Watch four at that point in time and did it give

115
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,225
Speaker 6:  you a har high heart rate alert? You,

116
00:07:59,645 --> 00:07:59,865
Speaker 7:  You

117
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:00,905
Speaker 6:  Know what, that's what we need to know.

118
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:05,265
Speaker 7:  I have gotten so many of those frigging alerts over the past

119
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:09,865
Speaker 7:  week where in, but they come in late. It, it gives you

120
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:13,425
Speaker 7:  a little notification that's like, you seem stressed

121
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:15,865
Speaker 7:  about 22 minutes ago. And

122
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:18,545
Speaker 6:  I'm like, oh. Oh, okay. So is that different? Yes, there are the stress,

123
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:22,305
Speaker 6:  there are stress notifications which come in a little after after

124
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:26,105
Speaker 6:  it's noticed that you may have had feelings. Yeah, physiological

125
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:30,105
Speaker 6:  feelings. And then there's also abnormal heart

126
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:33,705
Speaker 6:  rate alerts, which are like, oh, you're at rest, but your heart rate is really

127
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:37,665
Speaker 6:  high. You go, oh, oh I de oh. So I was curious if the ladder

128
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:41,505
Speaker 6:  was coming, but if, if it did have the the, we have

129
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:45,465
Speaker 6:  detected a moment of emotional distress. That's also

130
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:45,865
Speaker 6:  amazing.

131
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,625
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it might've, I was honestly too distressed to

132
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:50,905
Speaker 7:  notice.

133
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:55,105
Speaker 7:  But yeah, I seem to get a lot of those notifications,

134
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:59,445
Speaker 6:  Honestly. Oh, I do too. Don't worry. We're in the, the, the thick of tech

135
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:03,485
Speaker 6:  tober and tech tober just ended. That's peak you are having. But

136
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:03,685
Speaker 6:  this,

137
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,565
Speaker 3:  This is the beauty of both of your products that you both reviewed.

138
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:11,325
Speaker 3:  V you reviewed the new Pixel watch and, and the, the, these things.

139
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:15,365
Speaker 3:  Google has spent a long time making good

140
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:19,285
Speaker 3:  gadgets with stupid mistakes and, and

141
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:21,845
Speaker 3:  some of those mistakes were like, if you look at it wrong, it will just fall

142
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:24,805
Speaker 3:  apart into a hundred pieces in front of you. Or like if the wind blows on

143
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:28,645
Speaker 3:  it, it will scratch. And in, in both

144
00:09:29,065 --> 00:09:32,965
Speaker 3:  the watch and the phone, Google seems to be like rapidly

145
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:37,125
Speaker 3:  actually solving those problems and you're like, I can now wear this lovely

146
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:41,765
Speaker 3:  round smartwatch out and not have it scratch

147
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:45,805
Speaker 3:  every time I bump up against another person on the sidewalk. And it's

148
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:48,005
Speaker 3:  like, these are just the little things. And this is what I mean by, I think

149
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,125
Speaker 3:  we all kind of had the same experience. Like I reviewed the Pixel Buds headphones

150
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:54,925
Speaker 3:  and there is no single like Earth

151
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:58,205
Speaker 3:  shatteringly great thing about them. It just does all the things and does

152
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:02,115
Speaker 3:  it pretty well. And that is like kind of the ball game. It turns

153
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,875
Speaker 3:  out that it's like if it just does all the things and doesn't have glaring

154
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,475
Speaker 3:  weaknesses, I'm probably really gonna like this product. And I feel like

155
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:11,235
Speaker 3:  v you had that experience at the watch too. It was like, none of this is

156
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,475
Speaker 3:  like mind blowing new stuff. It's just like a really good smartwatch for

157
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:15,075
Speaker 3:  the first time ever.

158
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:19,595
Speaker 6:  I did have a moment where I was sitting here and I was just like, holy fuck.

159
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:24,305
Speaker 6:  Did, did Google Make is, is Google

160
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:28,325
Speaker 6:  the maker of the best Android smartwatch right now? Hold

161
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:32,415
Speaker 6:  on, wait, Google. 'cause like, you know, the, the,

162
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:36,335
Speaker 6:  the very short TLDR of Android smartwatch history is that

163
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:40,695
Speaker 6:  up until 2021, they were kind of dog shit because Google

164
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:45,255
Speaker 6:  had really neglected wear OS two and it wasn't until

165
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:49,095
Speaker 6:  they like joined forces with Samsung to create Wear

166
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:53,135
Speaker 6:  West three. That stuff started to get better in

167
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:56,695
Speaker 6:  the Android space. But I would say up until this year, Samsung

168
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:00,015
Speaker 6:  was still technically the best or the most all around

169
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:04,895
Speaker 6:  Android flagship smartwatch maker. And you know,

170
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:08,855
Speaker 6:  Samsung has kind of been ghosting for a while and their

171
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:11,895
Speaker 6:  big update this year, which, you know, I still have this watch right here

172
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:15,575
Speaker 6:  with me was Squirkle, let's do a Squirkle guys

173
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:19,615
Speaker 6:  and there's Gemini on there, but that's Google's thing. But like Squirkle.

174
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,135
Speaker 6:  And so, you know, I, I've been having this watch here and I've been staring

175
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:27,655
Speaker 6:  at it while also staring at the Pixel Watch four on my wrist and going like,

176
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:31,455
Speaker 6:  I, I think Google's done it. I think they're the

177
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,175
Speaker 6:  Android smartwatch to beat because not only did they implement

178
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:38,615
Speaker 6:  Gemini in a much smarter way, even though I think it's still very hit or

179
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:38,735
Speaker 6:  miss,

180
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:45,165
Speaker 6:  they just all around have been innovating and iterating

181
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:48,925
Speaker 6:  year after year making progress. And this year they made a

182
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,725
Speaker 6:  ton of progress. It was like, I think Allison uses this descriptor a lot,

183
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:56,565
Speaker 6:  but it, it was like a bunch of updates in a trench coat

184
00:11:56,905 --> 00:12:00,205
Speaker 6:  and now you have a Pixel watch and it's a big adult now.

185
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:05,365
Speaker 6:  And I was genuinely just sitting here like, oh my god,

186
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,725
Speaker 6:  you know, it is really smart that they added a dome display because when

187
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:12,325
Speaker 6:  you look at it, you do have a lot more screen space. It is really smart that

188
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:16,165
Speaker 6:  they extended material three expressive over to the

189
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:18,965
Speaker 6:  smartwatch because now everything is more glanceable

190
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:24,005
Speaker 6:  raise to talk. I don't have to be a power ranger for that to activate.

191
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:26,845
Speaker 6:  It actually does not activate for me when I do that. You just have to do

192
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:30,725
Speaker 6:  it very gently. And there, there it goes. We have, we have

193
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:34,205
Speaker 6:  a race to talk for Gemini and you know, they made it repairable,

194
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:38,485
Speaker 6:  which, you know, I, I'm gonna credit the verge.com with some real

195
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:42,725
Speaker 6:  durability testing, much like Allison's Beach extravaganza,

196
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:48,525
Speaker 6:  you know, Chris Welch, RIP to, well you know,

197
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,245
Speaker 6:  not REP but our beloved former Chris Welch.

198
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:55,485
Speaker 3:  He cracked the first, he's not dead, but he's dead to us. That's the important

199
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:55,765
Speaker 3:  thing.

200
00:12:56,545 --> 00:13:00,205
Speaker 6:  He cracked the first Pixel watch and he has no idea how, he had no idea how

201
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:04,045
Speaker 6:  he did that. Then for the Pixel Watch two, I woke

202
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:07,605
Speaker 6:  up one morning and it was scratched to Helen back. You can look at our Pixel

203
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:11,285
Speaker 6:  watch two review to see the damage that was done. It was so bad that when

204
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,285
Speaker 6:  I texted the picture to Google, they sent people to my house

205
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:18,165
Speaker 6:  to pick up the watch and they were like, we must investigate what happened

206
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,205
Speaker 6:  to this. We must study what happened to it. Like

207
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:22,645
Speaker 3:  What criminal came through your window and just scratched up your watch and

208
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:22,765
Speaker 3:  left?

209
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:26,965
Speaker 6:  No, they actually sent it to a lab to see what happened so that we could

210
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:30,725
Speaker 6:  investigate. And all they said was abrasions happened

211
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:34,685
Speaker 6:  and it was scratched up really badly. And internally,

212
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:39,325
Speaker 6:  I have been told by my various comms friends at Google that they

213
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:43,165
Speaker 6:  blamed this guy Pete because he was But look at him at that time.

214
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:47,165
Speaker 6:  He's so sweet. Look at him, he's innocent, he's sweet and he's innocent.

215
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:50,845
Speaker 6:  He has done nothing wrong in his life, but he is mischievous and likes to

216
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:54,725
Speaker 6:  put smart watches in his mouth and chew on them. Especially when he was

217
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:58,605
Speaker 6:  a kitten, which, you know, he was a, he was a little baby when, but Soul

218
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,365
Speaker 6:  Watch too was happening. So now they, they curse this cat

219
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:07,045
Speaker 6:  and I take credit for the fact that the Pixel watch four is repairable because

220
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:11,045
Speaker 6:  we have done fucked up two of the displays

221
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:14,885
Speaker 6:  over time and you know, other people have as well. And it was like a

222
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:18,445
Speaker 6:  big thing online that the Pixel watch was not at all repairable. And guess

223
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:22,405
Speaker 6:  what guys? Now, now there's a little screws and they're

224
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:26,085
Speaker 6:  not proprietary screws. iFixit is gonna send sell

225
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,525
Speaker 6:  manuals and a repair kit so you can do it yourself for battery

226
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:33,205
Speaker 6:  replacements and display replacements. So that's

227
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:37,325
Speaker 6:  Thank you PD for your service. He's innocent. He didn't do it.

228
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:40,485
Speaker 6:  I don't believe that he did it, but in case you did, thank you for your

229
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:43,565
Speaker 3:  Service. No, he did it, but he did it on purpose for the cause

230
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:48,325
Speaker 3:  that was somebo, somebody had to do, you know what I mean? Like he's not

231
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:51,505
Speaker 3:  that smart if rights repair doesn't just do itself. Yeah.

232
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:54,025
Speaker 7:  PD really believes in right to repair.

233
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:55,385
Speaker 3:  That's exactly right.

234
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:59,025
Speaker 6:  He he does, he does because he's always, you know, like a cat

235
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:03,145
Speaker 6:  knocking shit off just to see how repairable it is. Yeah. So yeah,

236
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:05,585
Speaker 6:  that, that's, that's what PD contributed. It's

237
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:08,545
Speaker 3:  Like I fix it in Cats are the ones really getting this done for us, I would

238
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:12,345
Speaker 3:  say in general, but, so, okay, so this, this is, this brings us to the game

239
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:16,225
Speaker 3:  I wanna play here, which is, I think basically between these

240
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:20,105
Speaker 3:  devices and the Pixel 10, Google has had a very

241
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:23,705
Speaker 3:  good year of gadgets and I think is that a place where it's

242
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:27,625
Speaker 3:  probably, it probably has the best lineup of gadgets it's ever

243
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:31,545
Speaker 3:  had. And so I wanna do a thing I've been wanting to do with a bunch of companies

244
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:35,105
Speaker 3:  and I was gonna do it with Apple first, but I wanna do it with Google first.

245
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:39,305
Speaker 3:  And it's, it's a, it's a game I call company gadgets comma

246
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:43,305
Speaker 3:  ranked. And so what we're gonna do is, I, I have, I have made a

247
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:47,145
Speaker 3:  list of six Google gadgets and we're gonna rank them in order

248
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:50,825
Speaker 3:  from best to worst. And thi this is taking all things

249
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:54,105
Speaker 3:  into account, right? Like each one is gonna have a different set of competitors.

250
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:58,225
Speaker 3:  So it's how it relates to its competitors, it's what it costs, it's how you

251
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,625
Speaker 3:  feel about the company, it's all these things all considered and like we've

252
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,265
Speaker 3:  never had a way to be like our, the Pixel

253
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:09,505
Speaker 3:  buds better than the pixel fold. And dammit, we're doing that today

254
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:13,665
Speaker 3:  and maybe we'll never do this again, but I hope we will again and I think

255
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:17,185
Speaker 3:  it's gonna be very fun to do it. Our producer Travis

256
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:21,185
Speaker 3:  Eck has invented an entire new thing for us to do. Travis,

257
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,505
Speaker 3:  welcome to the show.

258
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:26,545
Speaker 8:  Hi. Thank you. Yes. I have vibe coded and

259
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:30,505
Speaker 8:  interactive for David to control during this segment so

260
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:33,745
Speaker 8:  that we can see the six products that we're going to rank

261
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,825
Speaker 8:  and their relative rankings to each other.

262
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:41,225
Speaker 3:  I need to know just a little bit about the vibe coding process. As you

263
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:45,145
Speaker 3:  know, a bunch of you over the summer did a vibe coding experiment

264
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:49,185
Speaker 3:  and I think none of you did it properly and you all did a bad job. But

265
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:52,585
Speaker 3:  Travis I think did a good job. So I wanna know, I want to know what you did.

266
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,105
Speaker 3:  How'd you do

267
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:56,105
Speaker 8:  It? I'm gonna tell you how I did this and then you're going to, you're going

268
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:59,945
Speaker 8:  to concede that vibe coding is much more difficult than you're claiming

269
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:03,705
Speaker 8:  that it's Alright. So basically all I wanted to do

270
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:07,745
Speaker 8:  was create a thing where there were six boxes and you could put the

271
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:11,305
Speaker 8:  little pictures of the things and you could drag them into the box and the

272
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:14,025
Speaker 8:  boxes are numbered one through six and then you can rearrange them if you

273
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:17,905
Speaker 8:  want. And the issue I kept running into, which has happened

274
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:21,385
Speaker 8:  every time I've tried to vibe code something, is it'll give you something

275
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:25,305
Speaker 8:  that's almost all the way there, but something's wrong with it. And so then

276
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:28,785
Speaker 8:  you'll say, Hey, can you not have it so that the boxes

277
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:32,665
Speaker 8:  overlap each other? Or can you make the text be bigger or

278
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:36,065
Speaker 8:  the texts not cut off and it'll be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I did that, I

279
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:39,145
Speaker 8:  did that already the last time that you asked. Yeah, it's, everything's great.

280
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:43,145
Speaker 8:  And then, and then you say, no, it's not, it's exactly the same as the last

281
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,305
Speaker 8:  time. And, and then it'll be like, mm, are you sure

282
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:50,485
Speaker 3:  I come up, I think I found the problem and it will change

283
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:53,485
Speaker 8:  Nothing. Yeah. It'll be like, oh yeah, I definitely found it, but it's like,

284
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:56,565
Speaker 8:  no, you didn't, you broke the whole thing. So I've come up,

285
00:17:57,445 --> 00:18:01,045
Speaker 8:  I have Pit Gemini and chat PT against each other

286
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:04,725
Speaker 8:  or maybe in collaboration with each other. So I will take a thing

287
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:08,925
Speaker 8:  that one of them has stalled out on and I will give the

288
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:12,725
Speaker 8:  code to the other l lm oh that and say, can you fix this

289
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:16,525
Speaker 8:  thing? And it'll fix it. And so I just ping ponged back and forth

290
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,805
Speaker 8:  from Geminis to Chachi pt.

291
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:19,405
Speaker 6:  That's

292
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:23,525
Speaker 8:  So like three or four times having one edit the work of the other one because,

293
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:27,405
Speaker 8:  because Chachi BT doesn't know that Gemini thinks that it

294
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:30,685
Speaker 8:  solved all the problems. So it's gonna go in. So anyway,

295
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,205
Speaker 8:  I I present to you.

296
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,395
Speaker 8:  Do you see what I mean though, David? Like

297
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:42,035
Speaker 3:  This is, this is fantastic. Is everything I ever wanted it to be. I actually,

298
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:45,515
Speaker 3:  I think the like make them check each other's work. It's just like a constant

299
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:48,795
Speaker 3:  fresh eyes solution. Yeah. I love this for you. So

300
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,595
Speaker 3:  Travis, thank you for explaining and with all that,

301
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:56,265
Speaker 3:  let's, let's, let's play this game. This is

302
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:59,785
Speaker 3:  let's, if you're on YouTube, you're gonna see this. If not, don't worry about

303
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:03,665
Speaker 3:  it. This is called the Matic. Bye Travis. Thank you. Bye. Okay,

304
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:07,185
Speaker 3:  so we have six gadgets that we're gonna do this with. The six

305
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:10,545
Speaker 3:  gadgets are, and this is like a, a slightly imperfect thing, but this is

306
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:14,145
Speaker 3:  the best way I could think to do this. We have the pixel tablet, we have

307
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:17,985
Speaker 3:  the Pixel, regular Pixel, we have the Pixel A series,

308
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:20,825
Speaker 3:  this one's the Pixel nine A, but I mean sort of the whole A series. We have

309
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:24,545
Speaker 3:  the pixel fold, we have the Pixel Buds and we have the Pixel watch

310
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:28,545
Speaker 3:  and we are going to rank these six devices slash they're kind of

311
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:32,185
Speaker 3:  categories ish from one to six. I almost included like

312
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:34,785
Speaker 3:  Fitbit and Nest, but that got too messy. So we're just, we're just doing

313
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:38,025
Speaker 3:  a pixel thing here. Do you guys wanna start at the top or the bottom? I kind

314
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,505
Speaker 3:  feel like the bottom is actually gonna be the easiest.

315
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:43,745
Speaker 6:  I wanna start at the bottom. I wanna start at the bottom. And I know what

316
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:47,185
Speaker 6:  it's at the bottom too. It is the fucking Pixel tablet. Sorry. Yeah,

317
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:48,625
Speaker 6:  we shoulda all set

318
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,825
Speaker 3:  It out once. This is easy. Yeah, we're all very much on the same page about

319
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:54,705
Speaker 3:  that. The annoying part of this is I don't even think the Pixel tablet is

320
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:57,625
Speaker 3:  like all that terrible. It's just that absolutely nobody should buy it because

321
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,585
Speaker 3:  Google has no interest in it. Android tablet apps are bad. And this

322
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:02,185
Speaker 3:  thing like, it's

323
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:02,865
Speaker 6:  So expensive.

324
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:06,865
Speaker 3:  Someday this thing will be $99 on amazon.com and I will buy it

325
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:09,345
Speaker 3:  that day. And until then it should not exist.

326
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:13,145
Speaker 6:  You know, it has one good idea that there's a doc that you constantly charge

327
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,265
Speaker 6:  your tablet on because my iPad, iPad, he's a speaker, speaker, doc idea and

328
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:19,985
Speaker 6:  has a speaker. Great idea. Yeah. But also the problem is, is because

329
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:23,385
Speaker 6:  it does that I never use it as a tablet. Mm. So

330
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:27,825
Speaker 6:  ing so wouldn't be, I have two don't mys

331
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:28,065
Speaker 6:  just lives

332
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:29,545
Speaker 3:  Like, it just lives on the dock.

333
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:33,705
Speaker 6:  It just lives on the dock in, in the two places. Like we never take it

334
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,265
Speaker 6:  down. It's our smart home. Like, you know, Jen had me,

335
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:42,185
Speaker 6:  well Jen walked me through building a smart home and after I told her all

336
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:45,825
Speaker 6:  of my woes and the structure of my house, she's like, I think Google's

337
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:49,885
Speaker 6:  system is for you. And so now I have two pixel tablets and I

338
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:50,605
Speaker 6:  hate them equally.

339
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:55,205
Speaker 3:  Fair enough. All right, well that one, that one was easy. I had a feeling

340
00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:58,485
Speaker 3:  we were all gonna land on this place. I'm sorry to the Pixel tablet.

341
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:03,205
Speaker 3:  I think I, I feel like from here things immediately get difficult for Yeah,

342
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:07,765
Speaker 3:  but let, let's build up from nothing. Alison, what

343
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:08,605
Speaker 3:  do you have at number five?

344
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:10,045
Speaker 7:  Oh, this is tough.

345
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:15,525
Speaker 7:  Gosh. Well I know what I want to be number one, so I'm

346
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:19,405
Speaker 7:  kind of working backwards I think. Okay. If this is kind of

347
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:22,525
Speaker 7:  in terms of who should buy these things.

348
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:27,205
Speaker 3:  No, it's best products, just best what is, what is in in all

349
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,605
Speaker 3:  this? This is, this is the, the point of this exercise is that it is extremely

350
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:35,165
Speaker 3:  all encompassing. Right? Okay. And so it's like, are are

351
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,365
Speaker 3:  part of it is should you buy it obviously like part of this ranking is going

352
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,765
Speaker 3:  to be ranking in which they are good and thus you should buy them. But I

353
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:44,645
Speaker 3:  think like price is a part of it, but it's not the

354
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:47,965
Speaker 3:  only part of it. And so it's like, I I, yeah, I'm putting all of this together

355
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:51,645
Speaker 3:  on purpose. I would propose that number five should be the pixel fold.

356
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:55,805
Speaker 7:  That's what I was thinking. I'm like, I feel bad. It's good. It's

357
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:56,565
Speaker 3:  A, it is good. It's

358
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,485
Speaker 7:  A great phone. But as far as like mass appeal, you know,

359
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:03,605
Speaker 7:  it's, it's not something I would still recommend. Even though you can take

360
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:04,725
Speaker 7:  you to the beach and drown it.

361
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:09,485
Speaker 3:  So our, our former colleague and now Googler Dan Seaford is like

362
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:12,845
Speaker 3:  forever just running around on threads, telling people about all the cool

363
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,645
Speaker 3:  things you can do with a foldable phone. And I believe him, it's lovely.

364
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:18,485
Speaker 3:  I think he is earnest about it and I love him for this. I

365
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:23,565
Speaker 3:  don't think Google or anyone has done a good job of making the case for why

366
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:26,925
Speaker 3:  you should have a foldable phone other than like look big screen, you know?

367
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:28,805
Speaker 3:  And like I love big screen only

368
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,285
Speaker 6:  Allison at tech events whipping out her foldable phone.

369
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:36,525
Speaker 6:  The only time I have ever wanted foldable phones were at

370
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:40,285
Speaker 6:  two tech events where my peers Allison at one of them and

371
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:44,125
Speaker 6:  my friend Sam from End Gadget at the other were like, huh, I got a live blog

372
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:48,005
Speaker 6:  this wifi in Brooklyn Navy, art is crappy. Well lemme just pull out

373
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:51,525
Speaker 6:  my foldable phone that can handle any awful CMS

374
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:56,045
Speaker 6:  God. And they're just blogging machines and I've gone, do I wanna

375
00:22:56,405 --> 00:22:58,605
Speaker 6:  foldable? That was the only time I ever

376
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:02,685
Speaker 7:  Fold. It was a triumphant triumphant moment for the fold. I think

377
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:06,565
Speaker 7:  the, I would put, I feel better about putting the pixel fold at five

378
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:09,725
Speaker 7:  because the Samsung galaxies Z fold seven

379
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:14,245
Speaker 7:  exists and it is so much thinner and lighter in

380
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:17,045
Speaker 7:  like more comfortable to hold and carry.

381
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:20,365
Speaker 7:  Don't bring it to the beach. But yeah,

382
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:22,685
Speaker 3:  This feels good. V any objections?

383
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:27,245
Speaker 6:  No, you know. Yeah, no, I, I agree Also, like

384
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:30,685
Speaker 6:  you're gonna go to the beach and at the beach you're gonna wanna read. And

385
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:34,805
Speaker 6:  as our good friend Dan Seaford always says, reading is one of

386
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:38,365
Speaker 6:  the primary uses for the foldable phone. So if you're gonna go to the beach

387
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:41,665
Speaker 6:  and you wanna read on your phone,

388
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:46,885
Speaker 6:  I mean come on, you can't be defeated by a tiny grain of sand. No,

389
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:50,245
Speaker 3:  This is true. All right. No, I think we're doing the fold. I feel good about

390
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:54,045
Speaker 3:  the fold in part because it's also still $1,800.

391
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:56,965
Speaker 3:  Yes. Like for all the ways it's getting better, it is still twice the price

392
00:23:56,965 --> 00:24:00,645
Speaker 3:  of all the other phones and that's bad. And that's true of all foldable phones.

393
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:05,165
Speaker 3:  Okay, this might be dumb. I think I wanna put the pixel

394
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:09,205
Speaker 3:  buds forth despite the fact that I just gave them a nine. And I think

395
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:09,765
Speaker 3:  they're terrific.

396
00:24:11,745 --> 00:24:15,645
Speaker 3:  But I wanna do this for one specific reason, which is that there are so,

397
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:19,165
Speaker 3:  so, so many good pairs of headphones out there. It's not that these are not

398
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:22,685
Speaker 3:  very good, it's just that like in the scheme of things,

399
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:26,445
Speaker 3:  I think the price on these is very good. But I also like there was just a

400
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:30,325
Speaker 3:  prime day sale that had the Pixel buds Pro two, which are even better,

401
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:34,245
Speaker 3:  but usually a hundred dollars more expensive, $60 off. So I'm like,

402
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:37,005
Speaker 3:  okay, if I have 130 to $150 to spend on headphones,

403
00:24:37,995 --> 00:24:41,245
Speaker 3:  give it a minute and shop for sales. And you can buy a lot of really good

404
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:44,285
Speaker 3:  pairs of headphones. And I don't think the pixel buds are like so

405
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:47,965
Speaker 3:  spectacularly better than everything that they deserve

406
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:51,965
Speaker 3:  sort of massive ranking. Yeah. Even though I think they're great.

407
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:56,975
Speaker 7:  That seems fair. They're not like standouts in the way that some of these

408
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:58,015
Speaker 7:  other things are. I think,

409
00:24:58,715 --> 00:25:02,095
Speaker 3:  And I kind of think I, if we put pixel buds forth, I think the top three

410
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:06,055
Speaker 3:  all qualify as like actual standouts in certain ways. Yeah.

411
00:25:06,975 --> 00:25:10,255
Speaker 3:  I will say though, like, look, these are purple and they're so cool and,

412
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,175
Speaker 3:  and I love them. And look, look at that. Come

413
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:15,975
Speaker 6:  On David, this was the line in your review and I commented this on the

414
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:19,775
Speaker 6:  review that I was like, yes, as the verges foremost senior purple

415
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:23,415
Speaker 6:  reviewer, I, I loved your love of purple

416
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:26,975
Speaker 6:  and the assertion that we should all have purple headphones and I think all

417
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:30,935
Speaker 6:  tech makers should get on that stat. But to

418
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:34,255
Speaker 6:  your point, you know, for four and five I was debating between the pixel

419
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:37,935
Speaker 6:  fold versus the pixel buds. Okay. And I think the

420
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:41,975
Speaker 6:  1800 does justify the number five. But

421
00:25:41,995 --> 00:25:45,915
Speaker 6:  the thing that was kind of for me about the pixel

422
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:49,435
Speaker 6:  buds was when we went to see the ha the content capture and the hands-on

423
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,915
Speaker 6:  Google itself was just like, well look at our phones, look at

424
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:56,955
Speaker 6:  our watch. And in the corner over there is the pixel buds. So

425
00:25:57,405 --> 00:26:00,275
Speaker 3:  Right. And that's the thing, they're like, they're, they're very good. But

426
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:03,395
Speaker 3:  you, I mean, and I said this in my review, like you, you, it's very hard

427
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,755
Speaker 3:  to find a bad pair of headphones these days, which is like a lovely thing

428
00:26:06,755 --> 00:26:10,435
Speaker 3:  about the world that there are a lot of great headphones out there at all

429
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,635
Speaker 3:  price points. But like I was looking just to sort of test my

430
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:17,955
Speaker 3:  price tolerance against others. And like you go to the Wirecutter and their

431
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:21,595
Speaker 3:  favorite pair of under a hundred dollars headphones is like a brand you've

432
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:24,755
Speaker 3:  never heard of that people absolutely love. And so it's like, okay

433
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:29,475
Speaker 3:  headphones, you're spoiled for choice. We

434
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:31,755
Speaker 3:  can make the pixel buts forth even though they're very good. And the purple

435
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:34,795
Speaker 3:  is awesome and if you have one, I will give you a high five on the street.

436
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:39,075
Speaker 3:  Alright, that's three. So let's pause here and take a quick

437
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:42,635
Speaker 3:  break. Just to recap, at number six we have the Google Pixel tablet,

438
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:46,645
Speaker 3:  easiest decision of the day. At number five we have the pixel fold. And number

439
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:50,245
Speaker 3:  four we have the Pixel buds. We're gonna take a super quick break, come back

440
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:52,285
Speaker 3:  and rank the top three. We'll be right back.

441
00:28:25,235 --> 00:28:29,165
Speaker 3:  Alright, we're back. Just to reorient, we have three things left on

442
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,965
Speaker 3:  the board. We have the pixel, which is like encompassing of all the normal

443
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:35,845
Speaker 3:  Pixel line, the Pixel, the Pixel Pro, the Pro xl, that's the pixel. We

444
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:39,645
Speaker 3:  have the Pixel watch, which frankly already a coup to be just in the top

445
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:43,285
Speaker 3:  half of the list here. And we have the Pixel A series including the Pixel

446
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:47,245
Speaker 3:  nine A, that's our top three in some order. Let's get back into it.

447
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:49,205
Speaker 3:  I think we have to put a phone here.

448
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:51,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I know which one I want.

449
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:53,845
Speaker 3:  Yeah, which one do you wanna put number three?

450
00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:58,365
Speaker 7:  I will put the regular pixel number three even though it's very good.

451
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:02,675
Speaker 3:  Okay. I think we agree on what number one should be then. Do we?

452
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:03,595
Speaker 3:  We'll get to that. Do

453
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:04,195
Speaker 7:  We? Okay.

454
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:05,195
Speaker 3:  I think, I think we might,

455
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:10,595
Speaker 7:  No, the Pixel is great. I think it's like you want an

456
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:12,675
Speaker 7:  Android phone that just feels like

457
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:18,755
Speaker 7:  Uncluttered and Unbusy and does

458
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:21,835
Speaker 7:  it tastes good pictures and it has chi too and all that. Like

459
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:26,235
Speaker 7:  great, this is, this is the phone you should get but it's, I don't,

460
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:30,875
Speaker 7:  I don't know, like there it is. You can get that,

461
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:35,195
Speaker 7:  you know that it, that is a thing that exists. It doesn't feel as

462
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:35,515
Speaker 7:  special.

463
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:39,635
Speaker 3:  But let me just, let me, this is an open question. I might be completely

464
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:43,485
Speaker 3:  wrong in setting myself up for failure here. If I'm just like a regular person

465
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:47,915
Speaker 3:  and I'm like, Allison, what Android phone should I buy? And you are allowed

466
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:51,655
Speaker 3:  to ask me no follow up questions. Aren't you recommending the Pixel?

467
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,235
Speaker 7:  Okay. Yes. But my follow up question

468
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:02,515
Speaker 7:  is, what is your wireless carrier giving away for free?

469
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:06,035
Speaker 7:  Because probably fair that's what you're doing.

470
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:10,555
Speaker 7:  No, no, no. In, yeah, I'm like, are you paying out of pocket? And

471
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:14,435
Speaker 7:  then, alright, I have, I have two follow-up questions to your no

472
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:15,475
Speaker 7:  follow up question. Question.

473
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:20,355
Speaker 3:  Well, so this is the part where I'm torn is I think right now

474
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:25,195
Speaker 3:  the Pixel 10 is the best Android phone and

475
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:28,395
Speaker 3:  I actually don't think it's like super close. Yeah. And I think that that's

476
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:31,355
Speaker 3:  a like meaningful, powerful thing and I don't think that's been true for

477
00:30:31,355 --> 00:30:35,195
Speaker 3:  a while. I think Samsung really like figured out a lot of stuff and

478
00:30:35,195 --> 00:30:38,195
Speaker 3:  got way ahead and I think Google has just sort of slowly resolutely caught

479
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:42,075
Speaker 3:  up and just the like day-to-day experience of using a Pixel to me

480
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:45,675
Speaker 3:  is so much more pleasant than using Samsung software still.

481
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:49,995
Speaker 3:  That like I just, again, like I I all the people in my

482
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:53,475
Speaker 3:  life who use Android, who don't wanna spend a lot of time thinking about

483
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:56,875
Speaker 3:  their phone have pixels and are happier for it. And I think that is like,

484
00:30:56,875 --> 00:31:00,635
Speaker 3:  that means something. But there are phones that

485
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:04,555
Speaker 3:  cost as much as the Pixel that are also terrific, which is

486
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:07,155
Speaker 3:  why I think the Pixel belongs Yeah. In, in spot three.

487
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:10,675
Speaker 6:  But, okay, so my question though is that we're also ranking these things

488
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:14,395
Speaker 6:  against each other and if we're going with a phone for number three, you

489
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:18,195
Speaker 6:  know, people don't upgrade their phones every year anymore. And if you are

490
00:31:18,195 --> 00:31:21,835
Speaker 6:  making a long-term choice between an A

491
00:31:21,835 --> 00:31:25,785
Speaker 6:  series Pixel phone and a pixel phone, are you actually

492
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:29,505
Speaker 6:  gonna say that the A is better than the Pixel? Because I

493
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:33,625
Speaker 6:  have been using the Pixel 10 Excel for

494
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:37,505
Speaker 6:  Pixel Pro, you know, like one of those things for testing

495
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:41,865
Speaker 6:  in the summer of Android watches. And I feel like, oh my God,

496
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:45,945
Speaker 6:  it's really good. I'm, I'm like a, I've been an iPhone girly for a really

497
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,985
Speaker 6:  long time and I'm like, oh, this is really nice. I enjoy this quite a bit

498
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:52,705
Speaker 6:  except that I'm always accidentally circling to search

499
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:56,225
Speaker 6:  unintentionally. But yeah,

500
00:31:57,095 --> 00:32:00,985
Speaker 6:  it's a really great phone. It feels like I've been so delighted by it this

501
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:04,705
Speaker 6:  past summer that I'm just like, oh, well if I, if it were up to me,

502
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:07,505
Speaker 6:  would I, I would be pleasantly

503
00:32:08,815 --> 00:32:12,665
Speaker 6:  chuffed to spend the extra money regardless of carrier deals

504
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:16,945
Speaker 6:  for, for the mainline phone versus the budget. Especially if I am,

505
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:20,585
Speaker 6:  you know, a normal person and not a reviewer with like 50 phones in, in,

506
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:21,185
Speaker 6:  in my bag.

507
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:24,865
Speaker 6:  I, I don't know, I kind of am just like, I,

508
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:29,385
Speaker 7:  So here's, here's where I'm landing with this. I feel

509
00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:32,985
Speaker 7:  like a nice $800 phone solved

510
00:32:33,215 --> 00:32:36,985
Speaker 7:  like that exists that right now I would recommend the

511
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:40,485
Speaker 7:  Pixel. Like that's the one you should get. But it doesn't feel like

512
00:32:42,245 --> 00:32:45,925
Speaker 7:  a standout in the way that I think the

513
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:50,245
Speaker 7:  Aeries Pixel phone is. Like, it is the phone I recommend

514
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:54,245
Speaker 7:  to like, not phone people. I I made my parents buy

515
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:57,765
Speaker 7:  them 'cause I don't want them walking around with phones that are security

516
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:58,125
Speaker 7:  risks.

517
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:03,885
Speaker 7:  The, the amount of like software updates it gets and what you get

518
00:33:04,105 --> 00:33:07,885
Speaker 7:  in the price point, I think makes it like far and above

519
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:11,725
Speaker 7:  like, yeah, you're not gonna find this somewhere else. Not in this country.

520
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:15,525
Speaker 7:  And so I don't, I'm, I'm tipping my hand, but I I

521
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:18,045
Speaker 7:  really like the Aeries Pixel.

522
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:22,605
Speaker 3:  We do agree on the, on the, on the order at this first. Oh yes. I'm,

523
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:26,005
Speaker 3:  I'm with Allison. I think we're gonna put the pixel third because for, for

524
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:29,565
Speaker 3:  exactly that reason. I think when you, when you think about what is it

525
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:33,555
Speaker 3:  competing with, the Pixel has real one-to-one

526
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:36,315
Speaker 3:  competitors in the way that the Aeries just doesn't.

527
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:41,845
Speaker 3:  So that's VII appreciate your point, ed. I'm

528
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:44,685
Speaker 6:  Sorry. No, I, I defer to the phone expert.

529
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:49,605
Speaker 6:  I am the wearable lady so I de I defer to expertise here.

530
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:50,045
Speaker 6:  All right, so

531
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:53,645
Speaker 3:  This leaves us with in sixth place the Pixel tablet, fifth place, the pixel

532
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:56,765
Speaker 3:  fold, fourth place the Pixel Buds, third place the pixel.

533
00:33:58,205 --> 00:34:01,985
Speaker 3:  We have two left. We have the Pixel, A series and the Pixel watch. I

534
00:34:01,985 --> 00:34:04,905
Speaker 3:  believe Allison and I both wanna put the a series

535
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:06,485
Speaker 3:  number one

536
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,365
Speaker 3:  V Would you like to make the case for why the Pixel watch? Yes. Should be

537
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:11,765
Speaker 3:  number one.

538
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:13,715
Speaker 6:  Yes. Because you could,

539
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:19,115
Speaker 6:  I think it's how far it's come one and where it is

540
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:22,675
Speaker 6:  going. Again, you could make the argument

541
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:23,635
Speaker 6:  that,

542
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:28,855
Speaker 6:  you know, in the world of budget phones, there is massive innovation

543
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:29,255
Speaker 6:  coming.

544
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:35,095
Speaker 6:  I don't know if I fully believe that on my side of the, the

545
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:38,695
Speaker 6:  tech review sphere. But every conversation

546
00:34:38,805 --> 00:34:42,375
Speaker 6:  I've had with the Pixel team, every conversation I've had with

547
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:47,015
Speaker 6:  tech companies about what's coming next, it leads me to believe

548
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:50,535
Speaker 6:  that we are going to be living in a wearable hell soon.

549
00:34:50,785 --> 00:34:51,135
Speaker 6:  Which

550
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:56,535
Speaker 6:  is, is, and if you look at the scope of things,

551
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:01,055
Speaker 6:  the only real competitor that the Pixel Watch has now is the

552
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:04,855
Speaker 6:  Apple Watch. As far as flagship things go, and

553
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:08,815
Speaker 6:  I don't say this lightly, this was the most intriguing

554
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:12,605
Speaker 6:  and the most interesting and the most a plus

555
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:15,845
Speaker 6:  of the wearables smart watches that I have tested this year.

556
00:35:16,145 --> 00:35:19,685
Speaker 3:  You think the Pixel watch right now is better than the Apple Watch?

557
00:35:20,225 --> 00:35:21,925
Speaker 6:  It is more interesting. It is. That's

558
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:22,285
Speaker 3:  Not what I asked.

559
00:35:23,475 --> 00:35:27,365
Speaker 6:  It's almost on par. Okay. In some ways it's not, but it almost

560
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:31,205
Speaker 6:  is the fact that it has Fitbit integration and Fitbit does health

561
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:35,365
Speaker 6:  in a way that is smarter. Okay,

562
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:39,285
Speaker 6:  workout buddy, it's fine. But they're coming out with an AI coach

563
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:43,165
Speaker 6:  where the, the look that I got beforehand truly left

564
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:46,405
Speaker 6:  me sitting there going like, if they can pull this off, this is major.

565
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:52,205
Speaker 6:  You know, they are starting to innovate on, on on

566
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:55,845
Speaker 6:  certain areas that Apple just has not,

567
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:59,645
Speaker 6:  these Apple watches is still not repairable. These are, that's major. Yep.

568
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:03,965
Speaker 3:  I think you, you also can't underestimate how much better Gemini is than

569
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:07,485
Speaker 3:  Siri. And like if, if you, if you are a believer that

570
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:11,725
Speaker 3:  AI interactions and AI input in particular is like a real reason to get a

571
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:15,605
Speaker 3:  smart watch. And I think that it is, that is such a giant advantage for the

572
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:18,845
Speaker 3:  Pixel Watch series sucks so bad.

573
00:36:19,315 --> 00:36:22,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah. My husband has gotten used to me being able to ask

574
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:26,765
Speaker 7:  Gemini questions on the watch and he goes, ask your watch.

575
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:30,845
Speaker 7:  Can you ask your watch this thing? I'm like, hold up.

576
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:33,605
Speaker 7:  I decide what I ask my watch.

577
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:36,645
Speaker 3:  You should just start, just reach out your arm and be like, you ask Yeah,

578
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:37,245
Speaker 3:  I don't

579
00:36:37,245 --> 00:36:38,485
Speaker 7:  Care. You talk to the robot.

580
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:43,365
Speaker 6:  It's, it's just such a massive leap to the point where it's like,

581
00:36:43,865 --> 00:36:46,605
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna have to talk and we're gonna have to refi configure our buying

582
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,205
Speaker 6:  guide because this is the best Android smart watch on the market right now.

583
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:53,445
Speaker 6:  Like one plus sure the battery life is better, but the fact that

584
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:57,245
Speaker 6:  this can go from 14% to 27, no,

585
00:36:57,685 --> 00:37:01,205
Speaker 6:  14% to 97% in 34 minutes is massive.

586
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:05,845
Speaker 6:  I, I did a test where I had this Ultra and the

587
00:37:05,845 --> 00:37:09,725
Speaker 6:  Pixel Watch four, and this is the ultra three. They were both at

588
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:14,005
Speaker 6:  14 per 14% and 15% respectively. I

589
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:17,805
Speaker 6:  charged them for the same amount of time. The Pixel watch went to 97%.

590
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:21,645
Speaker 6:  The Apple Watch Ultra went to 55. Wow. So it charges faster than the Apple

591
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:25,525
Speaker 6:  Watch Ultra battery lifewise. I

592
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:29,435
Speaker 6:  got, I got a pretty good amount on, on

593
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:33,235
Speaker 6:  the, on the larger watch, which is the 45 millimeter.

594
00:37:33,235 --> 00:37:36,235
Speaker 6:  Allison got I think a day and a half on the smaller watch. I think I got,

595
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:39,995
Speaker 6:  I forget the exact number. It's in my review. My, my brain is Swiss cheese,

596
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:43,955
Speaker 6:  but it was a good amount on there. I think it was around 55

597
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:47,555
Speaker 6:  hours. 40, 40 at least 48 hours I got

598
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:51,355
Speaker 6:  comfortably. And the fact that you can just charge it in

599
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:55,275
Speaker 6:  15 to 30 minutes and it's gonna be most of the way charged you, you

600
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:59,235
Speaker 6:  kind of solve the battery problem. Yeah. Fitbit is much better at sleep

601
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:02,795
Speaker 6:  tracking than the Apple Watch is. You have a wider, robust thing. The only

602
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:06,115
Speaker 6:  thing that it's not better at is GPS tracking, which, eh, whatever

603
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:10,435
Speaker 6:  the maps are good enough, even though it has dual frequency

604
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,355
Speaker 6:  GPS right now, they've, they both have satellite

605
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:18,915
Speaker 6:  connectivity, but frankly, at least in my neck of the woods, I hooked up,

606
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:22,515
Speaker 6:  I hiked up three mountains in dense state forests

607
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:26,715
Speaker 6:  and at no point did I lose cellular coverage on either watch.

608
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:31,235
Speaker 6:  So I have to go travel down at Thanksgiving to t ask in Maryland

609
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:35,115
Speaker 6:  where my in-laws are from and there is a nut farm

610
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:38,925
Speaker 6:  where there's only one bar of service and you have to stand in a certain

611
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:42,885
Speaker 6:  way. So I have to go test satellite there because nowhere in

612
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:46,005
Speaker 6:  the tri-state area that I've been to in the last three weeks is without cell

613
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:50,125
Speaker 6:  coverage. So I'm just saying there, you

614
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:53,965
Speaker 6:  know, I I will a seed if you guys really wanna put the A series

615
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:57,805
Speaker 6:  first, but in terms of like cohesive vision where this thing is going,

616
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:02,965
Speaker 6:  the, the massive strides they've made in four years, it's just

617
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:06,965
Speaker 6:  blown me away. I think you both will say that I am am a

618
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:10,085
Speaker 6:  grumpy pants. It's very hard to impress me. We

619
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:13,325
Speaker 3:  Said a lot of mean things about pixel watches on the Verge

620
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:16,325
Speaker 6:  Over the years. We have said so many mean things. Yes. And look at me now,

621
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,565
Speaker 6:  I am saying this is the best Android smartwatch on the market. And I don't

622
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,405
Speaker 6:  say that lightly. I actually think

623
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:24,405
Speaker 3:  Debating there is a real case case to be made that this is just the best

624
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:28,205
Speaker 3:  smartwatch period. Like especially for like, if you're not like a

625
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:32,045
Speaker 3:  Capital F Fitness person and the thing you want is like all the

626
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:35,885
Speaker 3:  other stuff that they talk about for smartwatches, there's a

627
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:39,005
Speaker 3:  run of those things that the Pixel Watch does better than the Apple Watch.

628
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:43,245
Speaker 7:  I, my only complaint just coming from the Apple Watch to the

629
00:39:43,335 --> 00:39:47,045
Speaker 7:  Pixel for now, it feels like a

630
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:50,605
Speaker 7:  tiny bit slower. It is like just a beat behind

631
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:54,525
Speaker 7:  where I'm like pressing a a thing and it

632
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:58,805
Speaker 7:  takes a second to like pop up. You know, I don't know, you,

633
00:39:58,805 --> 00:40:02,725
Speaker 7:  you're the, the expert on this v maybe you can

634
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:05,525
Speaker 7:  tell me if I'm imagining things, but I

635
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:09,005
Speaker 6:  Literally just got a notification across all three of them at this point

636
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:12,565
Speaker 6:  in time. All the three watches that I have right now, that's too many notifications

637
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:16,485
Speaker 6:  and the Garmin was the slowest. It's, it's, my arms

638
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,885
Speaker 6:  are constantly buzzing and I've just gotten used to it. But

639
00:40:21,515 --> 00:40:22,325
Speaker 7:  What a sentence.

640
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:27,845
Speaker 6:  I think you could make the argument that the Apple Watch has gestures and

641
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:31,285
Speaker 6:  that this is only kind of starting to catch up in the gesture space. So in

642
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:34,245
Speaker 6:  terms of hands free computing, this is

643
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:38,525
Speaker 6:  a little bit ahead, but again, Gemini on the wrist,

644
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,525
Speaker 6:  light years ahead of Siri on the wrist, it's great. So

645
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:48,265
Speaker 6:  in terms of like the series 11, yeah.

646
00:40:48,495 --> 00:40:52,425
Speaker 6:  Okay. That wasn't a major upgrade year over, like I I

647
00:40:52,425 --> 00:40:55,985
Speaker 6:  legitimately said that the Apple Watch se three look at me. I just ha I'm

648
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:59,385
Speaker 6:  just pulling smart watches out of thin air. The, the SE three

649
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:03,105
Speaker 6:  was the most compelling Apple Watch this year and I, I love the Apple Watch.

650
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:06,425
Speaker 6:  I think it's a great smart watch. It has been leading the industry

651
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:10,985
Speaker 6:  for close to 10 years now and this is a real competitor

652
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:14,985
Speaker 6:  for the first time. I'm just like one-to-one. The ideas are there,

653
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:18,785
Speaker 6:  the cohesive vision is there. I, you know, in this

654
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:22,865
Speaker 6:  mad blitz review period where I've been writing like

655
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:26,185
Speaker 6:  10,000 words a week or what whatever and thinking about all these wearable

656
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:29,265
Speaker 6:  devices because why are there so many wearables this year? I don't know they

657
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:30,505
Speaker 6:  want me to die. But

658
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:35,785
Speaker 6:  you know, it's the one that at least of the wrist based

659
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:39,585
Speaker 6:  things has really impressed me and

660
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:43,825
Speaker 6:  it's a surprise. It's why I, if we were

661
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:46,385
Speaker 6:  doing this with a pixel watch today, I would not be arguing this hard is

662
00:41:46,385 --> 00:41:47,185
Speaker 6:  what I would say. Mm.

663
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:50,025
Speaker 3:  But yeah, I also would've, like I wouldn't ruthlessly started making fun

664
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:53,385
Speaker 3:  of you if you had started arguing that hard. No, I think you're right. And

665
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:57,345
Speaker 3:  I think the, like what is the best smartwatch question is a very complicated

666
00:41:57,345 --> 00:42:00,905
Speaker 3:  and b, totally moot, right? Like no one I think buys a watch first and then

667
00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:03,665
Speaker 3:  a phone. So you're just buying the one that connects to your phone and like,

668
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:07,585
Speaker 3:  it's sort of the end, but the fact that they're even meaningfully close

669
00:42:08,085 --> 00:42:11,825
Speaker 3:  and you don't have to miss one if you have the other huge victory

670
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:15,345
Speaker 3:  for phone buyers everywhere. Allison

671
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:19,905
Speaker 3:  was that, are you convinced, did that change your mind at all?

672
00:42:20,335 --> 00:42:23,945
Speaker 7:  This is tougher than I thought now because the, the

673
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:27,985
Speaker 7:  argument that there's more innovation and there's more coming

674
00:42:28,485 --> 00:42:32,305
Speaker 7:  to get kind of excited about I I totally see that on the

675
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:32,865
Speaker 7:  watch. Okay,

676
00:42:32,865 --> 00:42:35,865
Speaker 3:  So can I, let me just pour cold water on that really fast. One of the, one

677
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:39,745
Speaker 3:  of the core beliefs of the Verge is that we don't review products based on

678
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:43,465
Speaker 3:  future potential. And this is, we can redo this ranking at some point, but

679
00:42:43,465 --> 00:42:47,105
Speaker 3:  this right now is, is the best, what is the best Google product

680
00:42:47,795 --> 00:42:48,265
Speaker 3:  right now?

681
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:49,825
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah.

682
00:42:49,845 --> 00:42:53,465
Speaker 3:  And I think the, the the strides thing is real, right? And the, the the

683
00:42:53,735 --> 00:42:57,065
Speaker 3:  like distance Google has come is amazing, but like

684
00:42:57,725 --> 00:43:01,465
Speaker 3:  if we're gonna give, you know, I I I would have to sit here and be like,

685
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:04,265
Speaker 3:  well if Siri gets better and I don't wanna do that. So we can't do that with

686
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:04,705
Speaker 3:  generally.

687
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:08,865
Speaker 7:  Yeah, well it, there's also like a, phones

688
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:12,585
Speaker 7:  are such a known quantity and like a solved thing

689
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:16,745
Speaker 7:  where I talk to my hairstylist and I recommend, you know, I had her

690
00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:20,625
Speaker 7:  buy a pixel, but then I'm like, have you thought about a watch?

691
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:24,305
Speaker 7:  And I kind of, I kind of have evangelize like smart watches

692
00:43:24,745 --> 00:43:28,585
Speaker 7:  now 'cause I find them so useful. She got a smartwatch,

693
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:32,265
Speaker 7:  she got a Pixel watch and she loves it too. So you

694
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:32,945
Speaker 7:  I see

695
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:36,265
Speaker 6:  My side, Allison, come, come.

696
00:43:36,565 --> 00:43:39,785
Speaker 3:  So the, the other thing is Allison, the, the point you made about whatever

697
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:43,665
Speaker 3:  phone you're getting for free from your carrier is also a knock against

698
00:43:43,885 --> 00:43:47,185
Speaker 3:  the Pixel A series because the, the case I would make for the Pixel a series

699
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:49,985
Speaker 3:  is that for a very long time

700
00:43:51,405 --> 00:43:55,145
Speaker 3:  you could not buy a good phone for less than about

701
00:43:55,145 --> 00:43:58,585
Speaker 3:  $800. It just didn't exist. There were lots of phones at like

702
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:01,905
Speaker 3:  $200 that were fine and you could get like a perfectly

703
00:44:02,545 --> 00:44:05,665
Speaker 3:  functional Android phone for not a lot of money. That's been true for a very

704
00:44:05,665 --> 00:44:09,505
Speaker 3:  long time. But the, that sort of middle space where it

705
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:13,465
Speaker 3:  was good but not like feature complete but

706
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:17,225
Speaker 3:  was at a like meaningfully cheaper price point literally did not

707
00:44:17,225 --> 00:44:20,865
Speaker 3:  exist. And then Google showed up and was like, well we're gonna do the A

708
00:44:20,865 --> 00:44:24,665
Speaker 3:  series and has now gotten to the point where the a series

709
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:29,595
Speaker 3:  is meaningfully close to being as good as all of the

710
00:44:29,595 --> 00:44:33,485
Speaker 3:  high-end competitors to the point where now I'm like, okay, well

711
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:37,445
Speaker 3:  you can have the $800 or $900 or

712
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:40,165
Speaker 3:  a thousand dollars phone or you can have this $400 phone that makes this

713
00:44:40,225 --> 00:44:43,805
Speaker 3:  one compromise. What are your thoughts? And they, and like

714
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:46,445
Speaker 3:  I I've had the same experience you have where like a lot of people in my

715
00:44:46,445 --> 00:44:50,005
Speaker 3:  life just very happily bought a series phones and, and

716
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:54,205
Speaker 3:  have never looked back. And it's like, sure, you don't get some of the like

717
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:57,125
Speaker 3:  high-end stuff. You don't always get the fastest processor. You don't always

718
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:00,485
Speaker 3:  get the best camera, but like you get a very good phone for literally half

719
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:04,485
Speaker 3:  the price and it, it reinvented the existence of that

720
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:07,925
Speaker 3:  thing. And I want to give the pixel a series of a lot of credit for that,

721
00:45:08,985 --> 00:45:12,725
Speaker 3:  except particularly in the US there is a strong chance that you are trading

722
00:45:12,785 --> 00:45:16,525
Speaker 3:  in a phone and thus getting whatever you get for almost no money.

723
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:20,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah. God, that is the ugly thing. I I think what I,

724
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:25,005
Speaker 7:  one of the things I appreciate about the a series is that it is with in

725
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:29,205
Speaker 7:  the realm of possibilities that you would pay out of pocket for this thing

726
00:45:30,305 --> 00:45:34,045
Speaker 7:  and it's, you know, that that varies and there's

727
00:45:34,195 --> 00:45:37,765
Speaker 7:  financing you can do if you're even doing that much.

728
00:45:38,665 --> 00:45:42,485
Speaker 7:  But as far as like we're we are so in the grasp of these

729
00:45:42,645 --> 00:45:45,965
Speaker 7:  carriers and the deals and the upgrades and

730
00:45:46,865 --> 00:45:50,845
Speaker 7:  it feels so like kind of refreshing that the Pixel a

731
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:54,725
Speaker 7:  series is over here is like if you wanna break free of

732
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:58,485
Speaker 7:  that and you can like cobble together 500

733
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:02,485
Speaker 7:  bucks, you can still trade on your phone and probably get some

734
00:46:02,485 --> 00:46:06,245
Speaker 7:  money off of that that exists and you can just own it and you can walk

735
00:46:06,245 --> 00:46:10,005
Speaker 7:  away with it and it's your phone and you haven't made a

736
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:13,965
Speaker 7:  huge sacrifice as far as you know, performance or features. You

737
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:17,725
Speaker 7:  don't get a telephoto camera now, but you know, you can probably make do

738
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:22,485
Speaker 7:  that's my, that's my one thing to keep the

739
00:46:22,575 --> 00:46:26,365
Speaker 7:  Pixel a series phone in the number one spot. It just feels

740
00:46:26,395 --> 00:46:29,805
Speaker 7:  like it's the phone that can break the cycle

741
00:46:30,185 --> 00:46:32,045
Speaker 7:  of carrier deal addiction.

742
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:35,965
Speaker 3:  All right Allison, I'm gonna make you do an incredibly unfair thing. I'm

743
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:39,685
Speaker 3:  sticking with the Pixel nine A as my number one V

744
00:46:39,825 --> 00:46:43,765
Speaker 3:  has made a, I would say a surprisingly great case for

745
00:46:43,765 --> 00:46:46,645
Speaker 3:  the Pixel watch. You have to break the tie.

746
00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:50,325
Speaker 7:  Oh my gosh. Well I was gonna buddy just ran away

747
00:46:51,515 --> 00:46:52,005
Speaker 7:  like I'm out

748
00:46:54,185 --> 00:46:58,045
Speaker 6:  Is looking the door that's close right now and he's like, let me out because

749
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:02,365
Speaker 6:  the whatever. But I will concede that there

750
00:47:02,505 --> 00:47:06,205
Speaker 6:  are times when I am using Gemini on the wrist and

751
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:10,185
Speaker 6:  I'm just like, I'm gonna just pull out my phone. So

752
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:14,025
Speaker 6:  if we're talking about that, I would not be mad for the Pixel

753
00:47:14,025 --> 00:47:17,985
Speaker 6:  watch to be number two to me, I'm just

754
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:21,345
Speaker 6:  saying it's the best Android smartwatch out there. It is. And so if we're

755
00:47:21,345 --> 00:47:24,905
Speaker 6:  talking about Google products as a whole and we're talking about like the

756
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:28,785
Speaker 6:  best thing that it does, you know, I

757
00:47:28,815 --> 00:47:31,045
Speaker 6:  I'll be satisfied if it's in the top two.

758
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:34,925
Speaker 3:  I think on this list number two for the Pixel Watch is like there's going

759
00:47:34,925 --> 00:47:38,485
Speaker 3:  to be rejoicing on the Pixel Watch team if if for this to even be number

760
00:47:38,485 --> 00:47:39,045
Speaker 3:  two on here,

761
00:47:39,395 --> 00:47:42,685
Speaker 6:  I'll be satisfied for it to be number two. So Alison, go with your heart.

762
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:43,805
Speaker 6:  I made my case.

763
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:47,805
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna go with Pixel Watch number two as the like,

764
00:47:48,255 --> 00:47:51,965
Speaker 7:  happy to be here. It's it's love in its life. And the number two

765
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:55,165
Speaker 7:  slot there, pixel nine a Reigns Supreme,

766
00:47:55,795 --> 00:47:57,605
Speaker 7:  it's the phone you get your dad to buy.

767
00:47:58,405 --> 00:48:00,565
Speaker 3:  Honestly, the Pixel watch was just happy to be nominated, you know what I

768
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:03,045
Speaker 3:  mean? Exactly. It's an honor just to be here at the award ceremony.

769
00:48:03,515 --> 00:48:03,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

770
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:08,245
Speaker 6:  It's, it's it's getting best supporting actress even though it didn't even

771
00:48:08,245 --> 00:48:10,845
Speaker 6:  think it would get nominated and yeah. You know, it's,

772
00:48:10,945 --> 00:48:14,525
Speaker 3:  It just, it just came for the, for the free alcohol and instead it got

773
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:16,285
Speaker 3:  nominated and like that's, that's a huge victory.

774
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I'm, I'm quite satisfied. So

775
00:48:18,245 --> 00:48:21,605
Speaker 3:  Just to recap at number six we have the Pixel tablet, which is the one team

776
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:24,725
Speaker 3:  at Google that should feel bad at the end of these rankings. I would say

777
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:29,605
Speaker 3:  at number five we have the pixel fold. Number four, we have pixel Buds number

778
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:32,925
Speaker 3:  three, we have the pixel, which I should say encompasses like just the pixel,

779
00:48:33,015 --> 00:48:36,925
Speaker 3:  pixel Pro, all the, just the regular pixels. Number two,

780
00:48:37,185 --> 00:48:40,925
Speaker 3:  we have the pixel watch and at number one the best product Google

781
00:48:40,925 --> 00:48:44,525
Speaker 3:  makes. And I think we, I think we got this right, it's the pixel A series.

782
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:45,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah. We nailed it.

783
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:46,525
Speaker 3:  I love this.

784
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:50,885
Speaker 6:  I really can't believe that Google is good at smartwatches now.

785
00:48:50,955 --> 00:48:54,765
Speaker 6:  Like if you asked me this five years ago, I would've laughed at you. Google

786
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:58,685
Speaker 3:  Makes good gadgets consistently. This inevitably means in three months Google

787
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,445
Speaker 3:  will shut down the whole pixel line.

788
00:49:00,885 --> 00:49:03,165
Speaker 6:  They'll all go into the, we're all gonna look like eighties. They'll all

789
00:49:03,165 --> 00:49:04,245
Speaker 6:  go into the gravestone. God.

790
00:49:04,435 --> 00:49:08,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But until then, I'm very excited about this. Alright, thank you

791
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:12,205
Speaker 3:  both for doing this. Me, this was delightful. Travis, your tool works fabulously.

792
00:49:12,205 --> 00:49:15,565
Speaker 3:  This was great. We're gonna have to do this again. I I I enjoy this exercise

793
00:49:15,565 --> 00:49:19,285
Speaker 3:  very much and I think it's gonna be fun with some other companies too. Especially

794
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:23,285
Speaker 3:  ones that have like even weirder and more disparate product lineups to talk

795
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:27,085
Speaker 3:  about. Like, are the AirPods better than the iPad

796
00:49:27,185 --> 00:49:30,205
Speaker 3:  is a question I'm going to say out loud to both of you at some point in the

797
00:49:30,205 --> 00:49:32,045
Speaker 3:  near future and I'm very much looking forward to it.

798
00:49:32,835 --> 00:49:36,815
Speaker 7:  Yes, I'll be thinking about that. I don't know, I

799
00:49:36,815 --> 00:49:38,255
Speaker 7:  want the Dyson rankings.

800
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,535
Speaker 3:  Ooh, that's a good one too. The, yeah, let's

801
00:49:41,535 --> 00:49:45,375
Speaker 7:  Do, let's do vacuum cleaners versus that weird hair dryer

802
00:49:45,995 --> 00:49:47,335
Speaker 3:  Versus face

803
00:49:47,335 --> 00:49:48,615
Speaker 6:  Masks. Which weird hair dryer.

804
00:49:48,615 --> 00:49:51,055
Speaker 7:  Yeah. This be, oh god, there's more than one. Okay. I

805
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:54,655
Speaker 3:  Dunno. I like it. We're gonna have to call in like $1.5 million worth of

806
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:58,535
Speaker 3:  DYS and gear and then we'll do this. It's gonna be awesome. Alright, well

807
00:49:58,535 --> 00:50:01,775
Speaker 3:  until then we need to take a break. We're gonna come back, we're gonna talk

808
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:05,535
Speaker 3:  about AI and some studies about what AI is doing to our brains. But

809
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,655
Speaker 3:  until then, v Allison, thank you both. This was great. Thank you. We'll be

810
00:50:08,655 --> 00:50:08,895
Speaker 3:  right back

811
00:51:30,115 --> 00:51:33,895
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. Alison Johnson's still here. Hi Alison. Hello. Still,

812
00:51:34,105 --> 00:51:37,135
Speaker 3:  we're gonna do a question for the Vergecast hotline. As always, you can call

813
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:41,055
Speaker 3:  8 6 6 Verge one one. You can email vergecast@theverge.com. You

814
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:45,055
Speaker 3:  can find Allison at the beach and yell at your questions at her as she's

815
00:51:45,055 --> 00:51:48,975
Speaker 3:  dunking her phone into things. We love hearing all of your

816
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:52,615
Speaker 3:  questions and we're, we're gonna do lots more with them in the next several

817
00:51:52,615 --> 00:51:56,255
Speaker 3:  weeks. We're talking about some fun stuff, so keep it locked for now. Allison,

818
00:51:56,475 --> 00:52:00,445
Speaker 3:  we have a question about my favorite thing, the light

819
00:52:00,445 --> 00:52:01,965
Speaker 3:  phone? Mm, here it's,

820
00:52:02,705 --> 00:52:06,565
Speaker 16:  Hi, this is Lucas. I'm on my way to school right now campus.

821
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:11,525
Speaker 16:  I'm a student at Oregon State and I've been living with my light

822
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:14,645
Speaker 16:  phone since about May or so. And I love it.

823
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:19,005
Speaker 16:  It's absolutely fantastic. It's been my primary phone since then,

824
00:52:19,265 --> 00:52:22,725
Speaker 16:  and every time I grab it out, lots of students end up asking about it

825
00:52:23,345 --> 00:52:27,205
Speaker 16:  and it seems I, I'm not the only one who has switched to like a dumber phone.

826
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:31,325
Speaker 16:  I'm curious if more people, not just students are

827
00:52:31,435 --> 00:52:33,685
Speaker 16:  switching finally. Okay. Thank you.

828
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:37,125
Speaker 3:  Okay, so I, I bring this to you, Allison, because this is a thing I've been

829
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:40,965
Speaker 3:  grappling with a lot is I think the,

830
00:52:41,185 --> 00:52:45,125
Speaker 3:  the stories you hear about people like wanting to get away

831
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:47,525
Speaker 3:  from their phones and wanting to reset their relationship with their phones

832
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:51,205
Speaker 3:  and understanding the ways that their phones are sort of problematic

833
00:52:51,205 --> 00:52:53,845
Speaker 3:  influences in a lot of their lives. You and I have been hearing those stories

834
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:57,005
Speaker 3:  for forever, and I think my reaction to 'em for the longest time has been

835
00:52:57,005 --> 00:53:00,885
Speaker 3:  like, o okay, that is like a statistically insignificant

836
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:04,045
Speaker 3:  but interesting story, right? That like, what actually turns out to be the

837
00:53:04,045 --> 00:53:06,645
Speaker 3:  case is everybody pretty much just really likes their phones,

838
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:12,125
Speaker 3:  but it's somewhere in 2025. It has felt to me like

839
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:15,805
Speaker 3:  the tide is turning and there is not necessarily the light phone specifically,

840
00:53:15,805 --> 00:53:19,525
Speaker 3:  but this idea of wanting less phone.

841
00:53:20,225 --> 00:53:24,165
Speaker 3:  And I mean that in the broadest way possible seems to be real. And I,

842
00:53:24,365 --> 00:53:28,015
Speaker 3:  I wanna know if that is how it feels to you, or if, if not,

843
00:53:29,295 --> 00:53:32,695
Speaker 7:  I do think it's real and I, I hear it more,

844
00:53:33,695 --> 00:53:37,615
Speaker 7:  I guess anecdotally from friends who are like, ah, I don't know. I've

845
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:41,375
Speaker 7:  been thinking about just going with a, a minimalist phone and getting a,

846
00:53:41,975 --> 00:53:45,415
Speaker 7:  a compact camera and calling it a day.

847
00:53:47,115 --> 00:53:50,895
Speaker 7:  And I always just, I hesitate a little

848
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:54,615
Speaker 7:  bit. I'm like, well, I'm gonna be the bummer here. But

849
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:56,135
Speaker 7:  like, you probably,

850
00:53:57,845 --> 00:54:01,695
Speaker 7:  it's tougher than it seems and it sounds like Lucas has, is loving it

851
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:05,575
Speaker 7:  and is having a great time with it, and that's incredible

852
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:06,055
Speaker 7:  for him.

853
00:54:08,255 --> 00:54:12,135
Speaker 7:  I have just struggled every time I've, I've tried one of these

854
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:16,095
Speaker 7:  sort of minimalist phones or it's a, a flip phone and you're kind of like,

855
00:54:16,205 --> 00:54:17,255
Speaker 7:  it's a throwback

856
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:22,415
Speaker 7:  and my kind of go-to recommendations are,

857
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:26,775
Speaker 7:  you know, maybe a minimalist phone is for you. Here's some things to

858
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:29,295
Speaker 7:  try before you throw everything away.

859
00:54:30,425 --> 00:54:33,855
Speaker 7:  Start your life over again without apps. Casey

860
00:54:34,055 --> 00:54:37,775
Speaker 7:  Johnston actually has a really good guide to dumbing down

861
00:54:38,005 --> 00:54:40,695
Speaker 7:  your smartphone. So kind of,

862
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:45,615
Speaker 7:  you basically do almost like a hard reset and you get rid of your apps and

863
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,255
Speaker 7:  you clean it up and you make it just less

864
00:54:49,575 --> 00:54:53,495
Speaker 7:  enticing. I think that's a, you know, a lot of people could do that

865
00:54:53,635 --> 00:54:55,655
Speaker 7:  and find themselves very happy with it.

866
00:54:57,875 --> 00:55:01,695
Speaker 7:  And the other recommendation I go to is maybe

867
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:05,855
Speaker 7:  a cellular smartwatch. Hmm. Which was the little

868
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:09,335
Speaker 7:  experiment I ran recently. And I

869
00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:13,585
Speaker 7:  found there are a lot of cases when I could leave my phone at home,

870
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:17,825
Speaker 7:  just go be out in the world, still have the ability to

871
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:22,385
Speaker 7:  text and make a call if I needed pay for stuff with

872
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,985
Speaker 7:  my, you know, tap to pay

873
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:29,585
Speaker 7:  that is well within, you know, you don't have to go buy a whole

874
00:55:29,605 --> 00:55:33,545
Speaker 7:  new phone. You don't have to get into a whole new system. You can get the

875
00:55:33,795 --> 00:55:37,185
Speaker 7:  smartwatch that exists for your phone

876
00:55:38,045 --> 00:55:42,025
Speaker 7:  and, and try that. But those are my, those are my big

877
00:55:42,025 --> 00:55:45,785
Speaker 7:  two things that I think a lot of people would be happy

878
00:55:45,785 --> 00:55:46,065
Speaker 7:  with.

879
00:55:47,105 --> 00:55:50,385
Speaker 3:  I agree. I've started recommending people buy the cellular

880
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:54,025
Speaker 3:  smartwatch, which was not a, a thing that I felt before. It was normally

881
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:56,905
Speaker 3:  like it's, there will be times where it's really useful, but unless you're

882
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:59,825
Speaker 3:  a person who goes on like really long runs and needs, that kind of thing,

883
00:56:00,545 --> 00:56:04,385
Speaker 3:  I was always like, just get the wifi, it'll be fine. But I do think now the

884
00:56:04,385 --> 00:56:08,265
Speaker 3:  opportunity to take that with you and have this sort of, if somebody

885
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:11,145
Speaker 3:  needs me, they can get me peace of mind, but still be mostly disconnected

886
00:56:12,005 --> 00:56:15,705
Speaker 3:  is actually really powerful. I wonder as you're talking to,

887
00:56:16,605 --> 00:56:20,065
Speaker 3:  you know, the companies that make phones or even the carriers or any of those

888
00:56:20,065 --> 00:56:23,645
Speaker 3:  folks, do you have any sense that they're starting to reckon with some of

889
00:56:23,645 --> 00:56:26,605
Speaker 3:  these changes? Like, are, are the folks building phones thinking about how

890
00:56:26,605 --> 00:56:30,245
Speaker 3:  do we help the people who are trying to reset the way that they're

891
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,165
Speaker 3:  using their phones?

892
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:35,605
Speaker 7:  I think they do, and there's a real tension. You know,

893
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:39,565
Speaker 7:  I don't, I don't know how far we can hope that they will go

894
00:56:39,825 --> 00:56:43,725
Speaker 7:  or expect them to go because they're kind of in

895
00:56:43,725 --> 00:56:47,645
Speaker 7:  the business of keeping us on our phones, you know, and maybe that's more

896
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:51,525
Speaker 7:  down to the, the app makers than the, the people who make the hardware.

897
00:56:52,465 --> 00:56:56,165
Speaker 7:  But I mean, there are really good tools on your phone for,

898
00:56:57,985 --> 00:57:01,845
Speaker 7:  you know, monitoring your screen time. I don't find that super

899
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:05,205
Speaker 7:  useful, honestly, but focus modes, and

900
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:10,485
Speaker 7:  I kind of find it funny that Apple's latest idea

901
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:14,485
Speaker 7:  about how to reign in your notifications is to just like invent a new

902
00:57:14,575 --> 00:57:18,285
Speaker 7:  focus mode that filters most of

903
00:57:18,525 --> 00:57:19,605
Speaker 7:  the noise out.

904
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:24,885
Speaker 7:  So the, the tools exist. And I think there,

905
00:57:25,015 --> 00:57:28,965
Speaker 7:  there is an understanding that people want this and we

906
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:29,605
Speaker 7:  want help

907
00:57:31,485 --> 00:57:35,445
Speaker 7:  bringing some balance into how we use our phones. So poke at those

908
00:57:35,445 --> 00:57:39,325
Speaker 7:  things. I think if you're kind of feeling this, but I don't, I don't know

909
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:43,125
Speaker 7:  if we can hope that the phone makers are gonna rescue us from our

910
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:44,005
Speaker 7:  addictions.

911
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:47,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I tend to agree. And I think the thing that I've always wondered about

912
00:57:47,925 --> 00:57:51,405
Speaker 3:  these companies is a, they obviously have tons of incentive to keep you on

913
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:54,085
Speaker 3:  your phone, but I've always wondered like, are they gonna get to the point

914
00:57:54,085 --> 00:57:58,005
Speaker 3:  where the narrative against phones becomes so huge

915
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,805
Speaker 3:  that they have to make some of these changes or else they risk losing people?

916
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,085
Speaker 3:  Hmm. I don't think we're there yet. I mean, I know for sure we're not there

917
00:58:05,085 --> 00:58:08,805
Speaker 3:  yet. Yeah. So we're definitely not at the point of like Apple and

918
00:58:08,805 --> 00:58:11,765
Speaker 3:  Google and Samsung need to be worried about people abandoning their phones

919
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:15,165
Speaker 3:  in droves. I don't think that's coming, but I do think

920
00:58:15,945 --> 00:58:19,685
Speaker 3:  the sort of human awareness that like my relationship with my phone

921
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:23,565
Speaker 3:  is not what I want it to be, and I'm not really in charge of it.

922
00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:28,085
Speaker 3:  I think that is something people have come around to. Yeah. More

923
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:28,365
Speaker 3:  and more

924
00:58:28,385 --> 00:58:31,725
Speaker 7:  All the time. Yeah, I think so. And there, it feels like

925
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:36,245
Speaker 7:  the big, you know, the apples the Googles and Samsung have are

926
00:58:36,635 --> 00:58:40,445
Speaker 7:  very gently kind of prodding us. Like, Hey, here's a

927
00:58:40,445 --> 00:58:44,325
Speaker 7:  focus mode, or maybe set up a bedtime routine if you want. You know,

928
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:48,165
Speaker 7:  don't worry, no worries if not. So I,

929
00:58:48,285 --> 00:58:50,205
Speaker 7:  I don't know, maybe they will get a little more

930
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:55,565
Speaker 7:  robust, you know, as people ask for these things more. I hope so.

931
00:58:55,595 --> 00:58:55,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

932
00:58:56,195 --> 00:59:00,165
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Agreed. I did, by the way, reach out to Kai Tang, who's one of the

933
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:03,685
Speaker 3:  co-founders of the light phone to ask about this specific question,

934
00:59:04,945 --> 00:59:08,925
Speaker 3:  and he told me that the light phone is sold out of all of its inventory and

935
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:10,285
Speaker 3:  that the gap between

936
00:59:11,795 --> 00:59:15,445
Speaker 3:  what they sell and how quickly they can build them means right now that the

937
00:59:15,445 --> 00:59:18,965
Speaker 3:  wait time for a light phone three is two months. Oh, wow. And actually getting

938
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:22,805
Speaker 3:  worse, which is, he described a, a problem, but

939
00:59:22,885 --> 00:59:26,405
Speaker 3:  a good problem to have. Yeah. So I think, again, I don't think the light

940
00:59:26,405 --> 00:59:29,765
Speaker 3:  folks are producing phones in the quantities of, you know, the, the Apples

941
00:59:29,765 --> 00:59:33,445
Speaker 3:  and Samsungs of the world, but this thing, they've been at this for like

942
00:59:33,485 --> 00:59:37,445
Speaker 3:  a decade and I think that they, they have seen the, the, the sort of movement

943
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:41,285
Speaker 3:  towards it really build. And I think I'm starting

944
00:59:41,285 --> 00:59:44,165
Speaker 3:  to talk to more and more startups who are building gadgets about this idea.

945
00:59:45,465 --> 00:59:49,285
Speaker 3:  And, and there is, there's real energy in, in like, what else is there for

946
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:53,045
Speaker 3:  us to find out there? And I think everybody thinks, we just haven't figured

947
00:59:53,065 --> 00:59:56,405
Speaker 3:  out the mainstream answer, which makes me worried that there isn't one.

948
00:59:57,985 --> 01:00:01,645
Speaker 3:  But at least it's fun to see people continue to, to poke at this. And I think

949
01:00:01,645 --> 01:00:05,005
Speaker 3:  for me personally, I stole a bunch of Casey's idiot, Casey was on the Vergecast

950
01:00:05,085 --> 01:00:07,925
Speaker 3:  a while ago explaining some of this stuff, and I deleted a bunch of my apps.

951
01:00:08,325 --> 01:00:12,245
Speaker 3:  I made my phone background black, and I offloaded

952
01:00:12,545 --> 01:00:16,485
Speaker 3:  all of my fun apps onto a different device. I have this, I have

953
01:00:16,485 --> 01:00:20,405
Speaker 3:  this last year's pixel fold, which I need to

954
01:00:20,405 --> 01:00:22,445
Speaker 3:  return to Google at some point, but I keep around for testing reason.

955
01:00:24,105 --> 01:00:27,365
Speaker 3:  I'm just lazy to ship. Thanks. Leave me alone. And this is now my fun phone.

956
01:00:27,475 --> 01:00:30,725
Speaker 3:  This is where a TikTok is. This is where Instagram is. This is where all

957
01:00:30,725 --> 01:00:34,485
Speaker 3:  the things that I want to just screw

958
01:00:34,485 --> 01:00:38,405
Speaker 3:  around on a screen with Liv. And this phone is now mostly for

959
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:41,965
Speaker 3:  like talking to my family and attempting not to look at very often.

960
01:00:42,565 --> 01:00:45,645
Speaker 3:  And that has been awesome. Love that. I, I love that. Obviously most people

961
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:49,245
Speaker 3:  should not buy two phones. That's insane. But if you have two phones lying

962
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,285
Speaker 3:  around, I highly recommend it.

963
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:55,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I, my job is to use my

964
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:59,125
Speaker 7:  phone as much as possible, so I'm, I'm pretty jealous right now.

965
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:02,005
Speaker 3:  That's the other way. Get a job that requires you to have tons of screen

966
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:04,405
Speaker 3:  time and then guilt is gone. Yeah. Problem solved.

967
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:08,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I'm just, I am, I open up TikTok and I'm like, another day

968
01:01:08,685 --> 01:01:12,285
Speaker 7:  at work. Another day in the, the content minds. Yeah.

969
01:01:13,395 --> 01:01:16,325
Speaker 3:  This is what, this is what we do here. We do this for you people. Yes. Allison

970
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:20,205
Speaker 3:  looks at her phone all day for you only subscribes to the Verge, so she can

971
01:01:20,205 --> 01:01:20,725
Speaker 3:  do it even more.

972
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:23,605
Speaker 7:  Please. My family is starving.

973
01:01:25,305 --> 01:01:27,605
Speaker 3:  All right, Allison, thank you as always. I'll see you later. Thank

974
01:01:27,605 --> 01:01:28,885
Speaker 7:  You. Alright,

975
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:32,725
Speaker 3:  That's it for the Verge cast. Thank you to V and Allison for playing

976
01:01:32,725 --> 01:01:36,125
Speaker 3:  my silly game with me. Thank you to Travis for going through the true

977
01:01:36,345 --> 01:01:40,205
Speaker 3:  rigors of vibe coding this insanity for us. And thank you as always

978
01:01:40,265 --> 01:01:43,005
Speaker 3:  for watching and listening. If you have questions about any of it, if you

979
01:01:43,005 --> 01:01:46,005
Speaker 3:  think we got the rankings wrong, if you too want to make a forceful argument

980
01:01:46,545 --> 01:01:49,125
Speaker 3:  for the Pixel Watch, get at us.

981
01:01:49,725 --> 01:01:53,325
Speaker 3:  vergecast@theverge.com. Is the email 8 6 6 version one one is the hotline.

982
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:56,605
Speaker 3:  If you, if you think the Pixel tablet should have been higher, if I'm being

983
01:01:56,605 --> 01:01:59,645
Speaker 3:  honest, I don't really wanna hear it, send that to Allison, leave us out

984
01:01:59,645 --> 01:02:03,205
Speaker 3:  of it. But anything else, I'm very curious what you think of the rankings

985
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:07,045
Speaker 3:  and even still who you would like to see us rank

986
01:02:07,315 --> 01:02:10,885
Speaker 3:  next. This is a fun game. I had a good time. We're gonna do this again. What

987
01:02:10,885 --> 01:02:14,725
Speaker 3:  company do you wanna see us rank next? Also, last housekeeping thing. Thank

988
01:02:14,725 --> 01:02:17,845
Speaker 3:  you to everybody who has been watching and listening to and sending us feedback

989
01:02:17,845 --> 01:02:21,285
Speaker 3:  on the version history episodes so far. We've done two, if you haven't caught

990
01:02:21,285 --> 01:02:25,165
Speaker 3:  up, we did Hoverboards, we did BBM. Both have been very fun and very chaotic.

991
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:29,085
Speaker 3:  We have six more already lined up for you to do when we're already starting

992
01:02:29,085 --> 01:02:32,125
Speaker 3:  to make the next batch of them too. But I wanna hear everything about what

993
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:34,245
Speaker 3:  you're thinking. What should we be making episodes about? What should the

994
01:02:34,245 --> 01:02:36,885
Speaker 3:  version history questions be? I already have some ideas about how we're gonna

995
01:02:36,885 --> 01:02:39,885
Speaker 3:  change those, but want to hear all of your feedback, all of your thoughts.

996
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:43,805
Speaker 3:  Again, vergecast@theverge.com. 8, 6, 6 version one, one. I'd love

997
01:02:43,805 --> 01:02:47,085
Speaker 3:  to hear from you. Until then. The Vergecast is the Verge Production and part

998
01:02:47,085 --> 01:02:50,165
Speaker 3:  of the Vox Media podcast network. The show is produced by Eric Gomez, Brandon

999
01:02:50,185 --> 01:02:53,365
Speaker 3:  Keefer, and Travis Uck. We will be back on Friday

1000
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:58,405
Speaker 3:  with Neli Patel, presumably to talk about Brendan Carr. But

1001
01:02:58,405 --> 01:03:02,005
Speaker 3:  all of the other things going on this week because as ever, there is a lot

1002
01:03:02,005 --> 01:03:05,925
Speaker 3:  going on this week. The gadgets keep coming, the AI people keep spending

1003
01:03:05,925 --> 01:03:08,965
Speaker 3:  money and we'll be here until then. Rock Roll
