2
00:01:21,075 --> 00:01:24,585
Speaker 4:  Hello and Welcome. To Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Samsung

3
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:25,905
Speaker 4:  Decks enthusiasts

4
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:27,025
Speaker 5:  And me

Speaker 4:  And Alex Cranz. Hi, I'm Neli. I'm your friend. Alex. Cranz is here. I'm your

6
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:33,825
Speaker 5:  Don. Don't know what Dex is. Yeah, no, I've used it. I've used

7
00:01:33,905 --> 00:01:37,665
Speaker 4:  It. You gotta find out. David Pierce refuses to use Dex.

8
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:41,425
Speaker 4:  So we've replaced him with Dan Siefert who's gonna show us his deck set up

9
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:41,665
Speaker 4:  today.

10
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:42,785
Speaker 6:  I'm the Dex Defender.

11
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:47,185
Speaker 4:  It's coming, actually, David's just on vacation. Yeah, but it for a moment,

12
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:50,745
Speaker 4:  you thought that I was so hardcore into Samsung decks

13
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:54,185
Speaker 4:  that I clipped my friend from his own show, didn't you? Yeah,

14
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:56,105
Speaker 5:  I, I would've believed it.

15
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:57,985
Speaker 4:  It's like that's who we are now. Yeah.

16
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:01,105
Speaker 5:  You, you and Dan are both like very passionate dex

17
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:02,585
Speaker 4:  Defenders in different directions.

18
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:06,505
Speaker 5:  Totally different directions. That's what's, and David's like. No. Yeah.

19
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:09,945
Speaker 4:  If You don't have a strong opinion about Samsung Dex, he can't be a pro or

20
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:10,265
Speaker 4:  con.

21
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:13,505
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm forming one right now. So don. Don't get ejected from the room.

22
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,185
Speaker 5:  It's going. It's coming.

23
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:18,825
Speaker 4:  No, no. David is on a very well deserved vacation. Dan is filling in for

24
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:20,185
Speaker 4:  him. Hi Dan. How you doing? I'm All

25
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:24,105
Speaker 6:  Right? I am not recording through Dex, to be clear, we'll get

26
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,505
Speaker 6:  into it. Not the right tool for the job.

27
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:28,665
Speaker 4:  I saw Dan in the office the other day and he goes, look at this. And he pulls

28
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:32,265
Speaker 4:  out what, by all accounts, looks like a laptop and

29
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:35,505
Speaker 4:  we'll, we'll let people look at it in a minute. It's, I mean, it's nuts.

30
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:38,905
Speaker 4:  And he is got his like, phone ed on the side and he is like, it's Dex. And

31
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:41,545
Speaker 4:  I was like, that's awesome. And I was like, you have to come on The Vergecast

32
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:45,425
Speaker 4:  and talk about it. And the first thing Dan said to me was, I will not

33
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:47,465
Speaker 4:  record through this. I don't trust it enough.

34
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:53,025
Speaker 4:  He's just like, nothing mission critical is happening here. Dan, show us

35
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:57,585
Speaker 4:  your just frankly absurd galaxy fold Samsung

36
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:59,285
Speaker 4:  deck laptop set up. It's

37
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:01,485
Speaker 6:  Good. Alright, I'm gonna try and show it to the camera as best as I can.

38
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:03,645
Speaker 4:  But remember, it's a radio show. It's a radio

39
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:04,005
Speaker 6:  Show. But,

40
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:07,605
Speaker 4:  So if you're in your car right now, pull over and close your eyes. And in

41
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:11,445
Speaker 4:  your mind's eye, imagine what Dan is saying. Or alternatively,

42
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:14,045
Speaker 4:  pull over and watch this on YouTube. Those are your two choices. Yeah.

43
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:18,485
Speaker 6:  So this is like not a new thing. To be clear, I bought a

44
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:21,445
Speaker 6:  next doc, which is AOC thing.

45
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:25,325
Speaker 6:  It's been out for a couple of years. This idea has been out for like, well

46
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:29,205
Speaker 6:  over a decade. You plug your phone into it, it's a laptop looking thing,

47
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,805
Speaker 6:  but there's no guts inside of it. There's no computer inside of it. It's

48
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:35,685
Speaker 6:  just a touch screen. It keyboard, track pad battery, and you plug

49
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:39,085
Speaker 6:  your phone into it. But what I did was I got this

50
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:40,565
Speaker 6:  magnetic mount,

51
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:44,005
Speaker 4:  It's like a folding MagSafe mount

52
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:48,245
Speaker 6:  So I put a MagSafe. If anyone's been following me on any

53
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,525
Speaker 6:  threads or, or mast on, you might've seen that. I put a MagSafe ring on the

54
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:55,485
Speaker 6:  back of my Z fold and then I bought this magnetic mount that I stuck to

55
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,325
Speaker 6:  the back of the next dock. And so now I've got a deck set up

56
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:03,405
Speaker 6:  with my phone on the side and it, it's effectively

57
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:06,365
Speaker 6:  a dual screen decks. Yeah, that's what

58
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:07,845
Speaker 4:  I'm calling it. It's the world's worst chrome.

59
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,805
Speaker 5:  Wait, is it a dual screen or a, a triple screen? It's dual. Like is

60
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:12,165
Speaker 5:  the decks.

61
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:13,565
Speaker 6:  It's dual. See there's two.

62
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:17,055
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But the, the fold I almost feel like is a, a dual screen

63
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:20,135
Speaker 4:  Already. Technically it's triple screen. 'cause the back of the fold has

64
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:21,415
Speaker 4:  a screen that's not being used.

65
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:24,855
Speaker 6:  If I could display something on the screen for people sitting across from

66
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:25,735
Speaker 6:  me at the coffee shop,

67
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:29,615
Speaker 4:  I am actually astonished that Dex doesn't put up a full screen

68
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:33,055
Speaker 4:  ad on the back of the fold screen. That's like you're witnessing the power

69
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:34,415
Speaker 4:  of Samsung decks. Yes.

70
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:35,495
Speaker 6:  Now go buy a fridge.

71
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:41,135
Speaker 6:  That would be quite wonderful actually. But no, it's, it's, it's a dual screen

72
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:44,615
Speaker 6:  thing. I got my phone on one side. The cool thing about this setup is that

73
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:48,455
Speaker 6:  you can use the phone as a phone. And so like that looks like a

74
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,255
Speaker 6:  phone. Then on the other side is the Dex interface.

75
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:55,495
Speaker 5:  It is also significantly better than what you were rocking.

76
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:59,175
Speaker 4:  No, it is, it is such a vast improvement over my attempt to use Dex.

77
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:02,215
Speaker 4:  The problem with it is that you still have to use a Galaxy fold.

78
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,735
Speaker 5:  You have to buy this fake laptop. I

79
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,495
Speaker 6:  Don't have a problem with that, but yeah,

80
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,815
Speaker 4:  I, my, I did not enjoy one minute of using the Galaxy fold.

81
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:15,895
Speaker 4:  Just the every piece of that just made me, and I, that's not to say I don't

82
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:19,295
Speaker 4:  enjoy using Android. I like using Android. The

83
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:22,975
Speaker 4:  Galaxy Fold is a very particular device Yes. With very

84
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:26,455
Speaker 4:  particular demands. And I just didn't like it. It's

85
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:28,455
Speaker 6:  Got a particular set of skills. We

86
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,655
Speaker 4:  Could say that. Yeah. And the skills are being clunkier than a regular phone.

87
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:36,175
Speaker 6:  Ah, maybe. but it could do a lot more than a regular phone. You know,

88
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,535
Speaker 6:  I think like, just to like back up on the Dex conversation here.

89
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:44,255
Speaker 6:  I think there are like two things that are appealing about Dex. One

90
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:48,015
Speaker 6:  is what you've been trying to do, Eli, which is like, I'm going ultra lightweight.

91
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:51,295
Speaker 6:  I'm just traveling with my phone and I roll into the office. Yeah. Plug into

92
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:55,215
Speaker 6:  a hotel desk and I have a desktop set up with a keyboard, mouse, and

93
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:58,805
Speaker 6:  a big screen there. That is one dream. Yeah. The other way, the other path

94
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:02,005
Speaker 6:  that's interesting to me at least is the setup that I've got here, which

95
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,805
Speaker 6:  is like, you could say, well, you're just carrying around as much as

96
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:09,445
Speaker 6:  a MacBook error and a phone. Anyways, the difference is

97
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,285
Speaker 6:  I don't have to like sync between two different devices here. Everything's

98
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:17,085
Speaker 6:  running off the phone. All of my data is running off the phone and it's using

99
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,965
Speaker 6:  my phone's internet connection. So what this is doing is essentially giving

100
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:23,605
Speaker 6:  me a laptop like experience with integrated cellular that I can't really

101
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:27,085
Speaker 6:  get through Apple or really through a lot of other parties. So that is like

102
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:30,485
Speaker 6:  the interesting thing. All that said, both paths

103
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:34,405
Speaker 6:  can lead to madness and there's a lot of junk involved

104
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:38,765
Speaker 6:  in either one of them. I just find it pretty fascinating. A, that It works

105
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,685
Speaker 6:  at all and B, how far it's come since I first experienced Dex way back in

106
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:44,645
Speaker 6:  like 2018. It is, it is wildly

107
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:48,525
Speaker 5:  You, you don't find it fascinating. No, you are

108
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,165
Speaker 5:  delighted by it. I'm,

109
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:53,845
Speaker 6:  I'm delighted by gadgets. Even if they don't look, look as well as some other

110
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:55,285
Speaker 6:  solutions. I was getting this, they let me

111
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:59,325
Speaker 5:  Dms from you about this thing. You're just like, look at it. It works. Yeah,

112
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,045
Speaker 5:  it looks cool. It's very cool at it. It looks cool as hell.

113
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:05,005
Speaker 4:  Again. My my the beginning of my Dex journey started

114
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:07,045
Speaker 4:  by knowing Dan had been Dex pilled. Yeah.

115
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:10,605
Speaker 5:  But then what happened when you saw that there was like a fake laptop involved?

116
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:14,525
Speaker 4:  Well, so first I was like, okay, this is so much closer Yeah.

117
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:18,725
Speaker 4:  To what I thought I wanted. Right. And then he showed me the next stock,

118
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:22,565
Speaker 4:  which is the most aggressively 16 by nine laptop in the world. Yeah.

119
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:26,405
Speaker 4:  Like the amount of bezel that is on the bottom of that display. You can

120
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,605
Speaker 5:  See it from here. It's,

121
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,565
Speaker 6:  It's, it's a good inch below the display of

122
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:33,565
Speaker 4:  Be, you could make that laptop four, three just by reclaiming bezels. Yes.

123
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:37,085
Speaker 4:  Yes. It's, it's a lot of bezel. And then

124
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:40,285
Speaker 4:  it's still decks, which is clunky and, and what

125
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,605
Speaker 5:  Have you left the laptop at work and

126
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:46,125
Speaker 4:  Just, yeah. What if I just had a desk with a laptop on it that I left here

127
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:50,085
Speaker 4:  like I used to do in the before time. That's,

128
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:51,285
Speaker 4:  that's where we're going. But

129
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,285
Speaker 5:  See if someone steals this one, they're not gonna get important neli secrets.

130
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:56,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You can't log into it if there's no phone. Yeah.

131
00:07:56,795 --> 00:07:58,685
Speaker 5:  It's just the fake laptop.

132
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:02,605
Speaker 4:  Look, I I know it's the, the dream is that you just walk around

133
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:06,965
Speaker 4:  with a cool phone. Yeah. Just plug it it into stuff and having it turn

134
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:10,165
Speaker 4:  into your thing. Yeah. That's the dream. We all agree. That's the dream.

135
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:13,165
Speaker 4:  A hundred percent. You throw it in a couple, your car, the car lights up

136
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:16,605
Speaker 4:  and it's your phone. Yeah. You can, you can sort of get there, but you have

137
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:19,405
Speaker 4:  to experience CarPlay for better or worse. It's

138
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:19,845
Speaker 5:  Great. You,

139
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:22,925
Speaker 4:  You, you come to the office, you throw it on a, a magnetic charger,

140
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,525
Speaker 4:  like a pad screen lights up, you're doing all your stuff.

141
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,245
Speaker 4:  Everyone knows what the dream is. Yeah. I get emails by people who are like,

142
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:35,085
Speaker 4:  I feel you on the dream. And then you sit down and you're like, I have to

143
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:38,925
Speaker 4:  use this galaxy fold. Which again, like the

144
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:41,245
Speaker 4:  screen, the screen is just like a bubbly, wavy experience.

145
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:45,285
Speaker 6:  I, I mean, I don't know if it was like your specific one or

146
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:45,925
Speaker 6:  whatever, but like,

147
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:46,925
Speaker 5:  No, yours is two Dan.

148
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:49,125
Speaker 6:  I mean, so if you look at mine,

149
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:50,885
Speaker 5:  I can see it from here.

150
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:55,125
Speaker 6:  Five. If you're looking at it off axis, then yeah, you can see that crease

151
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:58,045
Speaker 6:  and stuff like that. But when you're holding it straight on, you really don't

152
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:01,685
Speaker 6:  see the crease. And when the screen is on and you're like experiencing

153
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:05,605
Speaker 6:  content, you don't see the, the crease. It just disappears. It just

154
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,925
Speaker 6:  disappears. Like I've read like a hundred books on it this year. The

155
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:11,885
Speaker 4:  Pixel fold, which has I think the better aspect ratio

156
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:13,525
Speaker 4:  when it's full. See,

157
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:15,005
Speaker 6:  I disagree entirely because

158
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:18,925
Speaker 4:  I want to use it as a phone a lot of the time. And the galaxy fold does not

159
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,725
Speaker 4:  lend itself to being used as a phone. Yeah. 'cause it's too tall and too

160
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:25,525
Speaker 4:  skinny. So you're always unfolding it. The Pixel fold, at least folds in

161
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:28,205
Speaker 4:  that direction. And it got a big update this week along with the rest of

162
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:30,725
Speaker 4:  Pixel updates, which we'll talk about. There's actual news this week, like

163
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:34,685
Speaker 4:  quite a lot of it. But we're gonna do the first 20 minutes on Dex

164
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:38,885
Speaker 4:  anyway, the Pixel fold got an update this week that forces

165
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:43,045
Speaker 4:  any app to work on. Its on its version of a folding display at full

166
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:45,865
Speaker 4:  screen. Maybe I'll try that. but it doesn't have a dex mode.

167
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,105
Speaker 6:  No, you can't plug the Pixel fold into anything. It doesn't have video out

168
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:49,545
Speaker 6:  at all. Like,

169
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:53,145
Speaker 4:  Come on, turn it into a Chromebook. Let's do this first party decks. What

170
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:54,625
Speaker 5:  If you just like slap it into the back

171
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:57,425
Speaker 4:  Of one the flagship podcast of requesting Google make decks,

172
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:00,545
Speaker 5:  Do it Google

173
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:04,625
Speaker 4:  All. right. That's that. That's one thing. So the, the decks experiments

174
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:08,865
Speaker 4:  continue a pace. I don't recommend them, but if you have

175
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:11,905
Speaker 4:  strong opinions about Dex, we wanna hear from you two. And I just wanna mention

176
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:15,785
Speaker 4:  this before we begin. There's a big Supreme court case about the social

177
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:19,625
Speaker 4:  media moderation laws that were passed in Texas and Florida, which by I

178
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:22,545
Speaker 4:  I'm just gonna tell you, they're blatantly unconstitutional. Yeah. There's

179
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,785
Speaker 4:  pure violations of the First Amendment. They're government speech regulations,

180
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,025
Speaker 4:  but they're at the Supreme court. Supreme court's gonna, whatever

181
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,985
Speaker 4:  amicus briefs are being filed in these cases. One is by public

182
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:34,865
Speaker 4:  knowledge, which we, those

183
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:36,025
Speaker 5:  Are like supporting briefs,

184
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:38,345
Speaker 4:  Right? The supporting briefs not from the parties, it's just people with

185
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:41,945
Speaker 4:  strong opinions. Filing briefs is Supreme court. So you look at the dockets,

186
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:45,305
Speaker 4:  a bunch of people are filing them. Public knowledge, which is an organization

187
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,905
Speaker 4:  that we have talked to a lot. Folks from Public Knowledge you have encountered

188
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:51,865
Speaker 4:  on The Verge many, many times. John Bergmayer, public Knowledge, you have

189
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,545
Speaker 4:  probably encountered in our stories or our podcast in the past. He sent me

190
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:58,065
Speaker 4:  an email today. He is like, you're in our brief. And they cited Welcome to

191
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:01,945
Speaker 4:  hell. Elon. Yes. And the Supreme Court brief today, which

192
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:05,905
Speaker 4:  means Welcome to hell. Elon is now part of our government's history.

193
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:10,465
Speaker 4:  Like it's just, it's on, it's in, it's in the docket on a pivotal

194
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:11,585
Speaker 4:  First Amendment case.

195
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:15,825
Speaker 5:  I'm When do you think like law students are gonna start having to read? It's

196
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:16,825
Speaker 5:  required reading for 'em.

197
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:20,785
Speaker 4:  When my mom read this, she, she didn't even call me. She was so upset at

198
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:23,705
Speaker 4:  the number of F-bombs in the story that she called my sister.

199
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:28,465
Speaker 4:  And my sister had to call me to call my mother who then

200
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:32,025
Speaker 4:  said, why did you use some such language? And now,

201
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:36,225
Speaker 4:  now Clarence Thomas is gonna read that shit. And I just, I'm just, I'm

202
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:39,905
Speaker 4:  just, anything can happen. That's my message to the Youth of America. Any,

203
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:44,145
Speaker 4:  anything can, can happen. But I'm, I'm actually the these cases are, are

204
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:48,065
Speaker 4:  big deals. What's inside of it is do social networks have the right to

205
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:50,985
Speaker 4:  moderate their networks? Do they have their own First Amendment rights to

206
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:53,885
Speaker 4:  make choices on their networks? I think the answer has to be yes. It doesn't

207
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:57,405
Speaker 4:  matter which side of the aisle you're on. The answer has to be yes.

208
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:01,505
Speaker 4:  Because that way you can get things like subreddits. Yeah.

209
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:04,745
Speaker 4:  And you need things like subreddits. You need, maybe you need something like

210
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,825
Speaker 4:  X that is moderated in one very specific way and something that is different

211
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:12,505
Speaker 4:  and to let people decide. So that's the heart of this case,

212
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:14,545
Speaker 4:  but it is just very funny to me. I

213
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:16,745
Speaker 5:  Think it's great. I'm very excited for

214
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:20,065
Speaker 4:  You. I'm just, again, I, I just hope Clarence Thomas, I describe the Supreme

215
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:22,585
Speaker 4:  Court in this piece as a group of uncool weirdos.

216
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:26,185
Speaker 5:  I mean, I think most of 'em will read that and be like, fair.

217
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,905
Speaker 4:  I, I hope so.

218
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:29,945
Speaker 5:  Most of them. Not to Clarence Thomas.

219
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:32,465
Speaker 4:  I feel like I can go through the nine and be like, who will, who will see

220
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:36,385
Speaker 4:  themselves and who will like, Alito is gonna be pissed. Yeah. Like Alito

221
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:38,265
Speaker 4:  is like, look at these Jordans. I'm cool as shit.

222
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:41,785
Speaker 5:  Kagan's gonna be like, I get it. Understood.

223
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:45,785
Speaker 4:  Just if anyone can AI generate for me to photograph of Samuel Alito

224
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:49,705
Speaker 4:  pointing at as Jordans saying, I'm cool as shit. I'm not sure what

225
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:51,225
Speaker 4:  we'll do with it, but I will accept it

226
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:56,225
Speaker 5:  Just into your heart. Just happy to experience it.

227
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:59,985
Speaker 4:  Same later in the Black Jordans. Okay. There is a lot of news this week.

228
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,105
Speaker 4:  Let's start with Google. We, we've already been talking about Google Big

229
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:06,305
Speaker 4:  News this week. They launched Gemini. It's the new AI model. They've been

230
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:09,105
Speaker 4:  talking about it for a while. They started talking about it even when they

231
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:12,785
Speaker 4:  launched Bard the first time, even at io, they were saying, we have this

232
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:15,985
Speaker 4:  new model called Gemini that they've been doing demos of it. It is finally

233
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,975
Speaker 4:  here. It is obviously meant to be the

234
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:23,855
Speaker 4:  big step change competitor to chat s GPT in particular. s GPT

235
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:27,615
Speaker 4:  four. Yeah. David talked to Sundar Phai and

236
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:31,575
Speaker 4:  Demi Sabas who runs Google DeepMind, the head of AI over there. They're,

237
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,375
Speaker 4:  they keep talking about benchmarks, which I, I would like to get your opinions

238
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,095
Speaker 4:  on. We've reviewed many products. There's,

239
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:42,985
Speaker 4:  there's an importance of benchmarks in the world. I

240
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:46,905
Speaker 4:  don't know what an AI model benchmark is, but they talked about

241
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:50,145
Speaker 4:  it a lot. They talked about it a lot on 30 out, 32 benchmarks.

242
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:53,225
Speaker 4:  Gemini Beats, s GPT four. That's like

243
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,545
Speaker 5:  A gamer's nexus. Number of benchmarks

244
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:59,025
Speaker 4:  To run. Yeah. I don't know man. So we should talk about that, what that means.

245
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:02,865
Speaker 4:  And if that is a useful measure for us as we can figure out like

246
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,865
Speaker 4:  how all of us should evaluate different AI systems. But that is their claim.

247
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:10,045
Speaker 4:  30 outta 32. Sam Altman, you're back. Guess what you

248
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:12,285
Speaker 4:  got fired again. Like I, don Dunno.

249
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:17,325
Speaker 4:  Sundar told David that eventually Gemini will be integrated into search.

250
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:20,005
Speaker 4:  It's ad products and a Chrome, like this is the thing they're gonna build

251
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:23,885
Speaker 4:  on. It's in Bard. You can play with Bard. I

252
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:27,285
Speaker 4:  wanna talk about Bard in a minute. And then the main, the main main thing

253
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:31,005
Speaker 4:  about Gemini is that it is multimodal from the jump. Right?

254
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:35,055
Speaker 4:  So it understands video and audio. It can spit some of that stuff

255
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,775
Speaker 4:  out. There's a really fun video that Google released where a person is drawing

256
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:41,735
Speaker 4:  a picture of a duck and it just sort of figures out that it's looking at

257
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:43,455
Speaker 4:  a duck. Cool.

258
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:44,335
Speaker 5:  That's cool as

259
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:47,815
Speaker 4:  Hell. I would, I would posit that hotdog, not hotdog again,

260
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:51,885
Speaker 4:  remains the baseline framework to understand the entire AI industry.

261
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:56,445
Speaker 4:  That's a duck. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's a duck.

262
00:14:57,345 --> 00:15:00,845
Speaker 4:  So it's cool. It's like fun to play with. It's cool. The addition of multimodal

263
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:03,925
Speaker 4:  capabilities is what really happened this year in ai. That was the big step

264
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:07,805
Speaker 4:  change. And then obviously Google has new chips. It's more

265
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,885
Speaker 4:  efficient. They're excited about all that

266
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:13,565
Speaker 5:  Aspect. The multimodal stuff that's not actually live for, for

267
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,565
Speaker 5:  most people. That's only like, for like businesses. Right.

268
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:18,045
Speaker 5:  So these

269
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:21,605
Speaker 4:  Are the these are the three models. Yeah. So there's Gemini Nano, which runs

270
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:25,325
Speaker 4:  only on the Pixel eight pro. And Google's very excited about this.

271
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:29,925
Speaker 4:  Now the phone is the best phone for ai, da da. Yeah. So it's only in Pixel

272
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:33,845
Speaker 4:  eight Pro is Gemini Nano. That's the smallest version of the new model.

273
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:37,405
Speaker 4:  It can run on the Pixel, eights, tensor processing, all that stuff. Then

274
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:41,245
Speaker 4:  there's Gemini Pro, which is what you can go use in Bard today. Right.

275
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,125
Speaker 4:  And then there's Gemini Ultra, which is not out yet. Okay.

276
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:47,965
Speaker 5:  And, but that's the one like, because the pro version is still

277
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:51,925
Speaker 5:  just in Bard. Like that's the only way we can currently access it. And Bard

278
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,365
Speaker 5:  is still just text-based.

279
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:57,405
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The the pro version is still a chat bot type of thing where you

280
00:15:57,405 --> 00:16:00,845
Speaker 6:  type in, it gives you typed responses back. And Ultra is the one that involves

281
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:03,765
Speaker 6:  vision and pictures and video and stuff like that. And you're right,

282
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:08,325
Speaker 6:  Alex, that is like the difference now. And so we can't really experience

283
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:12,365
Speaker 6:  the multimodal aspect of this just yet. Ultra is coming

284
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:15,805
Speaker 6:  out next year according to Google. And it will most likely

285
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:20,045
Speaker 6:  be used for the more enterprise applications that are the higher

286
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:22,125
Speaker 6:  demand, higher intensity stuff. Well that,

287
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,685
Speaker 5:  That's the part that like Google is the most excited about, like over and

288
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,005
Speaker 5:  over again. Yeah. Beside that and the benchmarks, they're like, yeah, it's

289
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,485
Speaker 5:  really fast and you do all this stuff and you can't see any of it yet. Well

290
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:33,885
Speaker 6:  It's, it's the new thing, right? Right. Like, like the, the chat interface

291
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:37,845
Speaker 6:  we've had all year with chat s GPT four and, and the others as well

292
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:41,765
Speaker 6:  as Bard. So like it a better chat interface is great. Appreciate

293
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:44,805
Speaker 6:  it. But like the new thing is the multimodal thing. So I. That's understandable.

294
00:16:44,865 --> 00:16:47,925
Speaker 6:  Why Google is most excited about that. That is like the thing that if you

295
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,845
Speaker 6:  wanna put your, on your like predicting hat, like a robot is gonna use a

296
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:55,725
Speaker 6:  multimodal LLM AI interface in order to navigate the world. So like

297
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,485
Speaker 6:  that's like the exciting futurist stuff. So like, I get it. And

298
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:02,325
Speaker 4:  That's basically what de said in our piece. You can see how

299
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:05,605
Speaker 4:  we would get to robotics with a model like Gemini. Or at least they can see

300
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:09,405
Speaker 4:  it. What we can see is Google Park. Right. But you can see

301
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:13,085
Speaker 4:  how a robot looking at something would be able to make some interpretations

302
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:16,935
Speaker 4:  of it, spit out some new commands and go. So that, this

303
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,415
Speaker 4:  brings me back to like, how do we evaluate this stuff? I've been thinking

304
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:20,415
Speaker 4:  about this a lot. You've

305
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,335
Speaker 5:  Been playing with it a whole lot

306
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:24,495
Speaker 4:  Too. I, it's, I'm addicted to playing with Bard. 'cause there's nothing funnier

307
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:28,135
Speaker 4:  than asking a Google product how it will impact search. You know, it's just

308
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:31,615
Speaker 4:  like, it's, they gotta dance around it. So, I think playing with Bard is

309
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:35,255
Speaker 4:  really interesting. I think the connection that Bard has, or lack of

310
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:39,135
Speaker 4:  connection that Bard has to the Google search generative experience is

311
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:42,735
Speaker 4:  really interesting. So Bard is supposed to be

312
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:47,015
Speaker 4:  a pretty self-contained experience. Yeah. You open the chat bot, you ask

313
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:50,485
Speaker 4:  it for stuff, it can summarize things for you. They can watch a YouTube video

314
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:53,805
Speaker 4:  for you. Again, huge problems with that idea.

315
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:57,125
Speaker 4:  Like if the robot's watching the YouTube video for you, does the YouTube

316
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,285
Speaker 4:  creator receive any money? don don't know the answer to that question. don

317
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:01,445
Speaker 4:  don't think Google knows the answer to that question.

318
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:02,685
Speaker 5:  CliffNotes knows the answer problem.

319
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,125
Speaker 4:  Maybe So, I've been playing with Bart a lot Bar so

320
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,205
Speaker 4:  far. Barge just has confidently hallucinated at me left and right. Yeah.

321
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:14,925
Speaker 4:  I asked it why a Google executive would be upset at The Verge, I

322
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:18,485
Speaker 4:  won't name names this time. You can go look at my threads post. And it like

323
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,845
Speaker 4:  made a list of answers and then it confidently hallucinated

324
00:18:22,445 --> 00:18:26,285
Speaker 4:  complete with a link to YouTube. Yes. A Vergecast interview that

325
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,165
Speaker 4:  has never occurred.

326
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:31,285
Speaker 4:  It just took us to The Vergecast channel page. Aw,

327
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:33,325
Speaker 5:  Thank you for the promotion. Bard.

328
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:37,165
Speaker 4:  Great. I but that to me is so nuts. And then I

329
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:41,085
Speaker 4:  asked, why did you do this? Yeah. And it apologized to me

330
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:45,645
Speaker 4:  like, I'm very sorry. I misinterpreted some facts. I assumed this had happened.

331
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:50,005
Speaker 4:  I read some like titles of other Vergecast,

332
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:54,125
Speaker 4:  which random like not even relevant. Like even in the realm of relevance.

333
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:57,925
Speaker 4:  And it's like, but but it turns out on, on further examination, like

334
00:18:58,315 --> 00:19:01,045
Speaker 4:  this didn't happen. And I was like, why do you do this? And I was like, I'm

335
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,365
Speaker 4:  every day I'm getting better. Like you. That's

336
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:06,005
Speaker 5:  How I, what I say whenever I like file a really bad blog. Yeah. And I get

337
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:08,605
Speaker 5:  hard edits. I'm like, don't look, I'm working on it day every day. I

338
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,565
Speaker 4:  Get better. I didn't, I didn't read the source material. Yeah. I'm very sorry.

339
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:12,085
Speaker 4:  I'm

340
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:12,405
Speaker 5:  Very sorry.

341
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:16,685
Speaker 4:  You put that up against 30 outta 32 benchmarks and it's

342
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:20,605
Speaker 4:  like, wait, there's only one benchmark, right? Yeah. Does it lie

343
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:24,005
Speaker 4:  to you all the time? Can you trust what it says?

344
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:25,965
Speaker 5:  I don't think they're benchmarking that.

345
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:29,405
Speaker 4:  I, it appears not. I think there are benchmarking things like can it do math?

346
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:29,845
Speaker 4:  Right?

347
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:33,165
Speaker 5:  Because a lot of the benchmarks that seem to be around coding and so there

348
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:35,845
Speaker 5:  was a ton of coding benchmarks and that's really where it sounded like Google

349
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:39,765
Speaker 5:  is the most excited about it, is it's gonna put a whole lot of

350
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,965
Speaker 5:  coders out of jobs 'cause it can do it as well or better.

351
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:48,085
Speaker 5:  And then not a lot of conversation about the hallucinations, which for me

352
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:51,165
Speaker 5:  and you, and I think most people is like, that's what I actually care about.

353
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:54,725
Speaker 5:  Like, I'm happy it can do Python really, really well, but I need to know

354
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:58,565
Speaker 5:  if it's gonna lie to me and destroy the world. Or just lie to me and,

355
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,525
Speaker 5:  and, and keep showing me fake Vergecast videos.

356
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:05,165
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna read you the, the some of the benchmarks. Okay. Okay. There's

357
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:09,285
Speaker 4:  MMLU, which is a massive multitask language understanding. Oh, it

358
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:13,245
Speaker 4:  scores a 90% compared to s GPT four is 86%. Ooh, that means something

359
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,845
Speaker 4:  to you. Yeah. There's big bench hard.

360
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:18,685
Speaker 4:  That's, that's called

361
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:22,845
Speaker 4:  these the, the, that's a reasoning one. That's the one we put on

362
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:23,085
Speaker 5:  The gaming

363
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:26,965
Speaker 4:  Laptops. Big bench hard. Right? It's a diverse set

364
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:30,565
Speaker 4:  of challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. Gemini did 83 point

365
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,205
Speaker 4:  Gemini Ultra. Mind you 83.6%. GP four is

366
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:37,885
Speaker 4:  83.1. There's something called drop, which is reading comprehension

367
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:41,605
Speaker 4:  82.4 for Gemini Ultra 80.9 for s GPT four.

368
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:46,485
Speaker 4:  I swear to God this isn't a blog post that Google published. There's a reasoning

369
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,845
Speaker 4:  benchmark for AI systems called Hella swag.

370
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:54,285
Speaker 6:  All of these sound like the like skills comprehension

371
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:57,685
Speaker 6:  tests my kids go through in elementary school where they take the state tests

372
00:20:57,945 --> 00:21:00,965
Speaker 6:  and they're like, are you at grade level? Are you above grade level? Are

373
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:03,045
Speaker 6:  you behind grade level? Yeah. That's what all of these sound like. Are you

374
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:03,165
Speaker 6:  at

375
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:04,485
Speaker 4:  Hella swag? Yeah.

376
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:08,045
Speaker 6:  It's like what is your hella swag level? Are you at, are you at

377
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:11,965
Speaker 6:  acceptable hella swag? Are you hella, hella swag? Are you

378
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:12,565
Speaker 6:  just swag?

379
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:15,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Gemini is just swag. 87.8,

380
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:19,485
Speaker 4:  95.3. Hella swag score for s GPT four. Let's go.

381
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:23,205
Speaker 4:  I would remind you again that s GPT four is made by a company that is in

382
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:27,125
Speaker 4:  pure turmoil fired and rehired A CEO in

383
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,165
Speaker 4:  a matter of days. But

384
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:28,365
Speaker 6:  It's

385
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:32,005
Speaker 4:  Swag. It's super swag. There's some other ones. There's math ones

386
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:37,165
Speaker 4:  GSM eight K 94.4% for Gemini

387
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:40,925
Speaker 4:  92.0. So you could just read these. They're all in Google's blog posts. We

388
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,805
Speaker 4:  will link to it. My point is, you look at this

389
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:48,445
Speaker 4:  and with a benchmark test for a gaming laptop,

390
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:53,675
Speaker 4:  I I can draw some conclusions about, I don't know how fast the

391
00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:57,435
Speaker 4:  laptop is. Yeah. How well it will play Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Yeah.

392
00:21:57,855 --> 00:22:00,115
Speaker 6:  So, well a game people love the play the best.

393
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:04,315
Speaker 4:  People love it when we benchmark shadow the tomb writer, nobody loves

394
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:08,355
Speaker 4:  anything more. It's a, when we benchmark shadow the tomb writer. but it,

395
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:12,315
Speaker 4:  those things are related to what you might do. Right. And

396
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:15,675
Speaker 4:  I'm, I'm just reading these benchmarks for Gemini and I understand why Google's

397
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:19,155
Speaker 4:  proud of them. Yes, it is true. On 30 out of 32,

398
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:23,915
Speaker 4:  the number in their column is blue. And on two of 32,

399
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:26,955
Speaker 4:  the number in s GPT column is blue. That great you won.

400
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,625
Speaker 4:  It doesn't mean anything to me yet. And then in actually using the

401
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,395
Speaker 4:  product, I find myself saying, well if I

402
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:38,635
Speaker 4:  can't trust it, it doesn't matter. Yeah. It's,

403
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:41,995
Speaker 6:  It reminds me of the battery benchmark testing. Like

404
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,675
Speaker 5:  Yes, I was about to say the same. Like,

405
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:47,515
Speaker 6:  Manufacturers do rundown benchmark tests, all of them do this on laptops,

406
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:51,035
Speaker 6:  mobile devices, whatever. Whether they're Apple, HP, Dell, whoever. And they

407
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:54,915
Speaker 6:  will come out saying 22 hours of video playback time, which means

408
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,515
Speaker 6:  nothing when my laptop dies in five hours of me using it

409
00:22:58,975 --> 00:22:59,195
Speaker 6:  for

410
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:01,755
Speaker 5:  Work. 'cause you, you look at it and you see there's usually an asterisk

411
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,915
Speaker 5:  and it's like, we've turned off the wifi, we've turned off the Bluetooth,

412
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:07,475
Speaker 5:  weve turned off the video Soul video. Like yeah, we, we, the screen might

413
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:11,395
Speaker 5:  not even be on, but we did it. And, and it's the same thing here

414
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:14,795
Speaker 5:  where it is actually really, really hard to test a battery because there,

415
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:18,475
Speaker 5:  because there are so many variables and in the same way there's so many

416
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:22,355
Speaker 5:  variables with hallucination. So it's, it's like, it's really hard. They

417
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:25,875
Speaker 5:  can't even figure out how to make something to test. If it's hallucinating,

418
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,875
Speaker 5:  how are they gonna make a benchmark Yeah. To test if it's hallucinating.

419
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:32,515
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean I I I think it is fascinating that they have a benchmark for

420
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:35,915
Speaker 4:  understanding infographics. I think that's cool.

421
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:40,595
Speaker 4:  Like someone had to come up with that benchmark. Yeah. And, and someone had

422
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:44,475
Speaker 4:  to point out that Gemini Ultra gets an 80.3 on

423
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:47,605
Speaker 4:  that benchmark. Nailed it. Whereas the s GPT four gets

424
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:51,525
Speaker 4:  75.1. We can talk about the actual product. I'm, I'm focused on this

425
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:55,605
Speaker 4:  because I think there's a tendency with all tech products to try

426
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:59,325
Speaker 4:  to find some objective measure that will say that Apple is definitively better

427
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:03,205
Speaker 4:  than Microsoft or whatever it is. Windows Drools.

428
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:07,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Look at this benchmark. Like we live in it and I'm just

429
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:11,245
Speaker 4:  trying to apply that instinctively to being shown some benchmarks.

430
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:12,725
Speaker 4:  And I'm like, but I don't,

431
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:17,285
Speaker 5:  I think it's so hard to do with AI because AI is like, especially large

432
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:20,925
Speaker 5:  language models so nebulous. It is so vast,

433
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:24,445
Speaker 5:  right? Yeah. Like, like the amount of stuff it's ingesting and then that

434
00:24:24,445 --> 00:24:26,325
Speaker 5:  it can like recreate is enormous.

435
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,005
Speaker 4:  We are very close to being like, I'm gonna measure Gemini's skull and tell

436
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:32,445
Speaker 4:  you how smart it is. Yeah. Right. Like it's, it's like

437
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:35,965
Speaker 5:  Right there. It's like, oh, do we wanna do that?

438
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:40,445
Speaker 4:  So there, there's just some, some weirdness here. But at the same time,

439
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:44,285
Speaker 4:  knowing that one of these is good or worse at decoding infographics,

440
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:49,685
Speaker 4:  I shared a, a post with Andrew Moreno, our engineer the other day, where

441
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:52,925
Speaker 4:  someone was uploading all of the manuals to old Roland

442
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,285
Speaker 4:  synthesizers to

443
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,045
Speaker 5:  GP That would be something you two would talk about.

444
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:59,965
Speaker 4:  And then asking it how to make the Sounds on Cure records. And

445
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,845
Speaker 4:  it would just read the manual because those manuals are impenetrable. Yeah.

446
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:06,885
Speaker 4:  And it would just like spit out some settings for various songs. That

447
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,485
Speaker 4:  is the coolest shit in the entire world. Were were they accurate though?

448
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:12,285
Speaker 4:  I don't know. It was just a threads post about somebody who was excited,

449
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:15,885
Speaker 4:  but it was cool. but it's like, I'm certain it got closer than if you were

450
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:19,645
Speaker 4:  just ice cold reading the manual. Right. Especially a manual

451
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,685
Speaker 4:  that that that, that's impenetrable. I mean

452
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:24,565
Speaker 6:  If it gave you some like Depeche mode settings when you asked for the Cure,

453
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,965
Speaker 6:  that would not be very good. Right.

454
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:30,425
Speaker 4:  I mean, that would cause a Holy War. Let's be fair. Careful. That's my point.

455
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:35,305
Speaker 4:  But I, there's, there's some of that which I think is so cool that

456
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:39,265
Speaker 4:  these tools can do. And don don't know how to

457
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:42,865
Speaker 4:  evaluate a company telling me, I don't know how to make the connection between

458
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:46,825
Speaker 4:  the, the benchmarks are better and the capabilities are better.

459
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:50,025
Speaker 5:  I think it's because it's really, it's hard for them to do. So they're like,

460
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:52,945
Speaker 5:  okay, well I can lean on benchmarks because this is like something I can

461
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:56,385
Speaker 5:  actually say. I don't have to just be like, doesn't it feel nicer?

462
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,585
Speaker 5:  Which you get a lot of times with with gadgets. Yeah. They always are like,

463
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:03,425
Speaker 5:  gimme those, the subjective things. And largely with, with

464
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:07,705
Speaker 5:  ai it is largely subjective. Like, okay, yeah, it's cool that it can do

465
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:11,465
Speaker 5:  python and stuff better, but the the big stuff, the stuff that most people

466
00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:15,265
Speaker 5:  are gonna be using it for is all that the subjective stuff. And you can't

467
00:26:15,455 --> 00:26:19,345
Speaker 5:  test that. Like, it feels like you more have to do like a

468
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:22,705
Speaker 5:  research project. Like it's more like anthropology or something, I feel like.

469
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:26,665
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Than it is like mathematics and, and computations.

470
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,785
Speaker 4:  Right. Do these models have different personalities? Right? Do they, are

471
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:32,825
Speaker 4:  they better at different things? 'cause their cultures are like, you do start

472
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:36,585
Speaker 4:  to get into some very deep questions about the nature of intelligence and

473
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:40,385
Speaker 4:  then you're like, someone asked it if I was handsome and I was like,

474
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:40,745
Speaker 4:  Hmm.

475
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:45,845
Speaker 4:  It like literally said like, beauty is in the eye of the holder. And I was

476
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:48,645
Speaker 4:  like, well you got a little bit of personality there. Whew.

477
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:51,965
Speaker 5:  All. right. I see how it is. Damn.

478
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:55,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's like his contributions are vast but I No, no.

479
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,045
Speaker 4:  So anyway, people should play with it. I'm curious what people think of it.

480
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:04,445
Speaker 4:  There is obviously the future of Google's business

481
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:08,305
Speaker 4:  is here, right? The future of the search business, which is the cash cow

482
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:12,235
Speaker 4:  for Google is sitting right in this product. And I still

483
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:16,085
Speaker 4:  don't know how that's gonna work. And I don't know if Google

484
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:18,125
Speaker 4:  yet knows how it's gonna work. How is it

485
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:21,245
Speaker 5:  Working in the Pixel? I haven't tried the Pixel version yet. And I'm just

486
00:27:21,245 --> 00:27:22,285
Speaker 5:  curious like, so

487
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:25,565
Speaker 4:  The Pixel a pro is only, there's two things today. It's auto summarization

488
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:29,165
Speaker 4:  in the recorder app and smart reply in the keyboard. Keyboard are now Gemini

489
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:29,485
Speaker 4:  nano.

490
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,685
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah. I mean,

491
00:27:33,215 --> 00:27:36,755
Speaker 4:  And you can really feel that 29th benchmark. Yeah. When you're using smart

492
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:40,595
Speaker 4:  reply in the Yeah. Pixel a keyboard. I mean, look, those are auto

493
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,755
Speaker 4:  reply, auto complete. That stuff is really important.

494
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:44,635
Speaker 5:  That's true. That is true. Like, but

495
00:27:44,635 --> 00:27:48,565
Speaker 4:  The AI stuff they've been doing, the recorder app is neat. And like for,

496
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:49,565
Speaker 4:  you know, a lot

497
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:53,205
Speaker 5:  Of our reporters like it like, like a lot of our reporters are like, oh yeah,

498
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:55,565
Speaker 5:  I'll use a Pixel phone to just record because don don't have to worry about

499
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:59,045
Speaker 5:  all the variety, wide variety of transcription services

500
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:02,885
Speaker 5:  that cost a lot of money and also use ai. Yeah. So you can just do it that

501
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:06,805
Speaker 5:  way. That like, that's genuinely useful. But for a very small group of people,

502
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:07,365
Speaker 5:  I'd imagine

503
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:10,885
Speaker 4:  Google is always thinking about the, the, the journalists, hardworking journalists

504
00:28:10,985 --> 00:28:13,645
Speaker 4:  of the world when they make the Pixel features. But if you're recording a

505
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:15,645
Speaker 4:  meeting and it summarizes the meaning for you and that gets meaningfully

506
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:18,765
Speaker 4:  better. That's fair. That's great. And, and if that happens locally and you're

507
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:22,565
Speaker 4:  not sending your enterprise work product off to a cloud

508
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:24,045
Speaker 4:  service that's good for you

509
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:27,565
Speaker 5:  Gonna do all my CES briefings this way. It's

510
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:30,485
Speaker 4:  Just like, throw the phone down, be like, talk to this robot, let's go. It'll

511
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:31,645
Speaker 4:  summarize what you have to say for me

512
00:28:33,465 --> 00:28:36,325
Speaker 4:  anyway. But that, so that's the big news of the week. Like this is the future

513
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:39,645
Speaker 4:  of Google. You can just go play with Bard. It's neat.

514
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:43,845
Speaker 4:  There's other AI news this week. So Bing Dear your Suite

515
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:47,645
Speaker 4:  Bing announced something called Deep Search. So the

516
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:52,245
Speaker 4:  Bing has always, I can't believe I'm say this, we started out with Dex. I'm

517
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:56,205
Speaker 4:  going to go to Bing. There's always been one really fascinating part of the

518
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,725
Speaker 4:  Bing search product as it relates to s GPT four.

519
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:02,205
Speaker 5:  I just wanna sit with that sentence for a minute.

520
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,925
Speaker 4:  It's, they've been doing So I don't know if it has been good or it's worked

521
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,605
Speaker 4:  or it's taken one point of market share. But they've always been doing something

522
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:13,365
Speaker 4:  really interesting, which they call search orchestration.

523
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:17,485
Speaker 4:  Now what it's gonna do is take that one step farther. It's going to read

524
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:21,285
Speaker 4:  your search query. Microsoft's example is how do point systems work in Japan.

525
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:25,005
Speaker 4:  It's gonna figure out all the things that could mean, and it's gonna go search

526
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:27,965
Speaker 4:  for those things and lace them together. So you can figure out if you mean

527
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:31,725
Speaker 4:  credit card point system or weird social credit systems or whatever

528
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:35,485
Speaker 4:  it is. And it's gonna lace this here so it'll take more time. But it's actually

529
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:39,405
Speaker 4:  sort of like expanding your query for you. Yeah. And doing a

530
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:42,325
Speaker 4:  bigger, deeper search of the web web. I mean it's, it's, which I think is

531
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:42,965
Speaker 4:  fascinating. Yeah.

532
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:45,565
Speaker 5:  I feel like, you know, looking at it and, and seeing what they did there.

533
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:49,685
Speaker 5:  I think that's a great example of the loyalty programs because it is something

534
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:53,645
Speaker 5:  huge. It is nebulous. And if you don't have like the card, the

535
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:57,205
Speaker 5:  points guy or whatever for, for your region, that is

536
00:29:57,315 --> 00:30:01,125
Speaker 5:  genuinely useful. You want that, that summary and, and like

537
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:04,565
Speaker 5:  that's hard to do on your own. Yeah, you can, but it's obnoxious.

538
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:07,525
Speaker 4:  So what's really fascinating to me about this is that

539
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:11,935
Speaker 4:  if you'll remember when when Chat s GPT launched and Bing launched, there

540
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,535
Speaker 4:  was that explosion of interest in prompt engineering. Yeah. And we

541
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:19,295
Speaker 4:  had lots of conversations with people, lots of executives are on decoder

542
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:21,935
Speaker 4:  saying Prompt engineering is just a thing that's gonna happen in the middle.

543
00:30:22,705 --> 00:30:24,335
Speaker 4:  There need to be other, well join

544
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:27,215
Speaker 5:  Just did that great piece on, on prompt engineering.

545
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:30,815
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And everyone, there's this theory that that's like a local, that's

546
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:33,775
Speaker 4:  like a flash in the pan moment. Yes. And then you look at what Deep Search

547
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:37,415
Speaker 4:  is doing and it is mechanically taking your query

548
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:41,375
Speaker 4:  to the Bing search engine and rewriting it to be a longer prompt.

549
00:30:41,755 --> 00:30:45,215
Speaker 4:  So it takes, how do point systems work in Japan and it

550
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:49,655
Speaker 4:  rewrites the prompt to Bing as provide an explanation for how various loyalty

551
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:52,495
Speaker 4:  card programs work in Japan, including the benefits requirements, limitations

552
00:30:52,495 --> 00:30:56,375
Speaker 4:  each. And then it goes on, it's like a full paragraph long prompt. And you

553
00:30:56,375 --> 00:31:00,175
Speaker 4:  see that Microsoft has learned that it, it should just automate

554
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:04,015
Speaker 4:  prompt engineering for you. And that's how it should constantly talk to the

555
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:05,255
Speaker 4:  LLMs. It's

556
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:07,055
Speaker 6:  A, it's another job claimed by AI

557
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:10,175
Speaker 5:  Created and claimed in the same year.

558
00:31:11,155 --> 00:31:15,015
Speaker 4:  And you know, now that we know more about particularly how, how Bing

559
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:18,975
Speaker 4:  works, like the huge Meta prompt that it feeds into s

560
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:23,055
Speaker 4:  GPT is crazy. That's just that the one that killed Sydney

561
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:26,735
Speaker 4:  basically. Yeah. And killed the personality and puts the guide rails is just

562
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:30,725
Speaker 4:  a Meta prompt that is appended to your query. And

563
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:34,605
Speaker 4:  So don don't know if that's how Google is managing Bard. don don't know.

564
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:38,125
Speaker 4:  Like that's how they all work. But this is very much how Microsoft is starting

565
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:42,045
Speaker 4:  to manage Bing, which is fascinating. It's hysterical.

566
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:45,885
Speaker 4:  And this of this deep search tool just like kind of an extension of that.

567
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:46,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

568
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:50,005
Speaker 5:  Well, and I appreciate that. It's, it's pretty candid about it. I'm curious

569
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,725
Speaker 5:  like in practice how often it's gonna show you that whole search prompt so

570
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:57,325
Speaker 5:  that eventually you, you can figure that out and be like, okay, well So I,

571
00:31:57,325 --> 00:32:00,525
Speaker 5:  just do a whole paragraph now instead of being like, tell me how to fix it.

572
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:04,885
Speaker 5:  Which is probably useful for people. Yeah. I mean I would do that. I don't

573
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:07,405
Speaker 5:  know. I'm sure most people would just be like, tell me how to fix it. 'cause

574
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:08,805
Speaker 5:  that's faster and easier. But yeah.

575
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:12,765
Speaker 4:  So, but The race to to, to your point Yeah. The race, to

576
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:16,605
Speaker 4:  just answer the question continues a pace. And I think for Google,

577
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:20,765
Speaker 4:  the Gemini stuff is exciting. It shows they're in the game. They're, they're

578
00:32:20,765 --> 00:32:23,885
Speaker 4:  excited about it. Very obviously Sundar, you know, did a press tour, the

579
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:26,965
Speaker 4:  whole thing. But how they turn that into money is still a huge open question.

580
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:31,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I, I just dunno the answer. But if the end result is you ask the

581
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:34,525
Speaker 4:  LMA question, it just tells you the answer, whether it's going through this

582
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:38,325
Speaker 4:  like secondary prompt engineering exercise or not. Or it's passing the

583
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,765
Speaker 4:  hella swag test Yeah. Or whatever it's doing.

584
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:45,605
Speaker 4:  They gotta put ads in there somewhere. They gotta, they gotta make some money.

585
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:49,685
Speaker 4:  I have seen some people say they think that Gemini Ultra will be a

586
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:53,285
Speaker 4:  subscription product the way that s GPT four is a subscription product. s

587
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:54,925
Speaker 4:  GPT 3.5 is not, or hell

588
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:56,885
Speaker 5:  Grok is a subscription product.

589
00:32:57,465 --> 00:33:00,325
Speaker 4:  Gr also launched this week. Yeah, don't, it's fine.

590
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:05,405
Speaker 4:  Last two little bits of AI news, lemme take a break. Apple also made some

591
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:08,725
Speaker 4:  AI news this week, which is the first time Apple has made any AI news

592
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:09,645
Speaker 4:  really?

593
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:10,645
Speaker 5:  Baby

594
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:14,365
Speaker 4:  Steps, baby steps. They released a new model framework called MLX

595
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:18,525
Speaker 4:  that allows you to run various kinds of models and various

596
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:22,885
Speaker 4:  coding languages like PyTorch on their chips using their

597
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:24,085
Speaker 4:  memory architecture ideas.

598
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:27,245
Speaker 5:  I bet that was an internal tool that they're like, it's good enough, we can

599
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:30,525
Speaker 5:  now make it public. Because they, that that's been a big deal at Apple is

600
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:34,045
Speaker 5:  they don't wanna actually use all the other AI tools, but they want their

601
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,525
Speaker 5:  own a to I tools. Yeah. So they've been having to like, how do we build our

602
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:40,725
Speaker 5:  own Bard and Gemini and

603
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:41,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

604
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:43,245
Speaker 5:  Why are these names all well,

605
00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:47,205
Speaker 4:  And Apple is also leaning more into the open source world. Yeah. So

606
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:50,405
Speaker 4:  if you are, if you, you know, you're open source researcher, you want to

607
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:54,085
Speaker 4:  use Meta's Llama, which is open source, you wanna run an Apple silicon, you

608
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:57,405
Speaker 4:  now have a framework to do that that Apple is providing and supporting. Will

609
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:59,205
Speaker 4:  that get you anywhere? Like, I, I don't know,

610
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:03,125
Speaker 5:  I'm curious to see how well the Silicon handles it because just how

611
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:07,005
Speaker 5:  different all the different architectures handle ai. And it's particularly

612
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:10,805
Speaker 5:  like that stuff is like the Apple silicon is

613
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:14,645
Speaker 5:  very specifically built for a specific type of processing and it's good at

614
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:17,165
Speaker 5:  the other stuff. We've seen how good it's with video. And I'm just really

615
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:20,925
Speaker 5:  curious if that translates as like GPU kind of translates. I

616
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,045
Speaker 4:  Think you're right. Like Apple has very particular GPU ideas. Yes. But they

617
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:27,365
Speaker 4:  also have very particular neural engine ideas. Yeah. And we, we've just never

618
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,045
Speaker 4:  seen anyone attack that part of their chip to go head head-to-head with like

619
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:32,445
Speaker 4:  an Nvidia. Yeah. Because

620
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:36,085
Speaker 5:  AI g Yeah. All they have to do is is say like, yeah, it it opens your phone

621
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:38,765
Speaker 5:  real fast. It's really good at it and it's super smart and it's like, cool.

622
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:42,125
Speaker 5:  I have no way to ever test any Apple product. That's why we do,

623
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,765
Speaker 4:  Here's what you do. You run shadow of the tune. Yeah.

624
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:46,365
Speaker 5:  I was like, that's why we got shadows of the tomb reader. It's the only thing

625
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:49,445
Speaker 5:  that works, the only way to test an Apple product.

626
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:52,845
Speaker 4:  Okay. And then the last little piece of AI news, I will just remind everyone

627
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:56,805
Speaker 4:  again and again and again, these companies are running rampant with

628
00:34:56,805 --> 00:35:00,725
Speaker 4:  copyrighted information to train their systems. No one knows if

629
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:04,645
Speaker 4:  it's legal. They're insistent that they are, but all of them, all

630
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:08,605
Speaker 4:  of this money coin flip fair use lawsuit could take it

631
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:12,325
Speaker 4:  all down. It is just true. It's, it's a total coin

632
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:16,085
Speaker 4:  flip. You might have some opinions. I have some opinions. Our company has

633
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:20,005
Speaker 4:  some opinions. Hai has some opinions. I know s Andela

634
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:23,205
Speaker 4:  has some opinion. I've asked all of them and they're like, yeah, the legal

635
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:27,125
Speaker 4:  process will have to pay out Getty's lawsuit, Getty

636
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,045
Speaker 4:  image's, lawsuit against Stability. AI is not going go into trial in the

637
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:34,525
Speaker 4:  UK. And they obviously have suit here too. The law in the UK different than

638
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:38,445
Speaker 4:  the in United States. This is just a gigantic time

639
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:41,885
Speaker 4:  bomb in the middle of the AI boom. Yeah. Is that no one knows that this training

640
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:45,645
Speaker 4:  data is very used. Again, I I have an opinion. I think it is

641
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:49,805
Speaker 4:  probably not. And I am not that person. That's not

642
00:35:49,805 --> 00:35:53,525
Speaker 4:  how it came up at all. That's not that it's a surprising opinion

643
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:57,325
Speaker 4:  for me. But the idea that you can just take all of this stuff just to

644
00:35:57,325 --> 00:36:01,125
Speaker 4:  hoover it up and somehow create billions of dollars of value for your

645
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:01,845
Speaker 4:  users out of it.

646
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:03,125
Speaker 5:  That seems wrong

647
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:06,645
Speaker 4:  Without any, any return just on its face.

648
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:10,125
Speaker 4:  It seems like you're gonna go to a court without argument and something there

649
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,845
Speaker 4:  is gonna happen that you cannot predict. Yeah. Weird. Just we, and so we'll

650
00:36:13,845 --> 00:36:16,245
Speaker 4:  see. I don't know. don don't know. And the courts are not predictable.

651
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:20,365
Speaker 5:  You're, we're all gonna get like 50 cents for our tweets. Yeah.

652
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:21,125
Speaker 4:  That's what's gonna

653
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,045
Speaker 5:  Happen. Sorry. Here's your 50 cents. We used your tweets.

654
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:26,725
Speaker 4:  Google has to send you a penny Every time anybody uses Bar

655
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:29,445
Speaker 5:  Man. Those, those, those fanfic writers gonna make bank

656
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:32,765
Speaker 4:  And the lawsuits are just gonna keep happening because in particular in this

657
00:36:32,765 --> 00:36:36,365
Speaker 4:  country, fair use is not a precedent setting decision.

658
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:40,085
Speaker 4:  Every single fair use case evaluated on its merits de novo, like

659
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:44,245
Speaker 4:  it's supposed to be case by case. It's in the law. So you can just keep filing

660
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:46,525
Speaker 4:  the lawsuits until something else happens. Could

661
00:36:46,685 --> 00:36:48,085
Speaker 5:  Somebody just make a law at some point?

662
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:52,885
Speaker 4:  I one would hope I don Dunno if you've been paying attention to

663
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:53,805
Speaker 4:  the state of our government,

664
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:55,605
Speaker 5:  Just fix

665
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:58,845
Speaker 4:  It. Doesn't seem one day doesn't seem likely. One

666
00:36:58,845 --> 00:36:59,005
Speaker 5:  Day

667
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:02,365
Speaker 4:  George Santos is on cameo. That's the state of our government.

668
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:03,925
Speaker 5:  He's not in the government anymore.

669
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:05,565
Speaker 4:  Well, he's on cameo. Yeah.

670
00:37:05,715 --> 00:37:07,085
Speaker 5:  Just good pivot.

671
00:37:07,345 --> 00:37:10,765
Speaker 4:  All, right. We gotta take a break. I'm gonna sign up for Cameo. We'll be

672
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:11,045
Speaker 4:  right back.

673
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:25,655
Speaker 4:  All right? We're back. All, right? We're, we're off the AI Benchmark news.

674
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,175
Speaker 4:  Yeah, we're done. Now it's time for hacks. We're hacks

675
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:28,575
Speaker 6:  And

676
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:32,535
Speaker 4:  Snacks, hacks and freaks with a pH. Actually a pretty

677
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:35,975
Speaker 4:  important, what would you call it, Dan? A workaround.

678
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,575
Speaker 6:  Reverse engineering workaround. Yeah. Yeah. But there's like solution.

679
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:43,375
Speaker 6:  There's some spoofing happening there too, right?

680
00:39:43,605 --> 00:39:47,535
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Okay, Sonos, let's get into it. Sorry. So Beeper, which is a long

681
00:39:47,895 --> 00:39:51,615
Speaker 4:  standing iMessage workaround that for

682
00:39:51,865 --> 00:39:55,575
Speaker 4:  years basically until just recently involved you signing into

683
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:59,455
Speaker 4:  your iCloud account on a Mac Mini in the cloud as a relay service

684
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:04,295
Speaker 4:  now has reversed engineered iMessage and they say they can

685
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:06,095
Speaker 4:  do it natively. Dan, what's going on here? Yeah,

686
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:10,015
Speaker 6:  So it's a, it's a fascinating story as, as Neli

687
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:13,735
Speaker 6:  just said, you know, beeper's been around for a while, but over the

688
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:17,535
Speaker 6:  summer a developer posted proof of

689
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:21,015
Speaker 6:  concept to GitHub that they had reverse engineered the

690
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:24,215
Speaker 6:  iMessage protocol and was able to send messages directly from

691
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:27,935
Speaker 6:  basically any device Linux Windows, Android,

692
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:32,175
Speaker 6:  two Apple's iMessage servers without having to use a relay server.

693
00:40:32,835 --> 00:40:36,495
Speaker 6:  And when Beeper found out about this Beeper, who is

694
00:40:36,775 --> 00:40:40,215
Speaker 6:  headed by former Pebble, CEO, Eric Micki

695
00:40:40,215 --> 00:40:41,255
Speaker 4:  Pebble, the smartwatch company,

696
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:43,975
Speaker 6:  Pebble the Smartwatch. Yes, you do have to clarify. There are like eight

697
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:47,855
Speaker 6:  failed Pebbles. Now don't name your future company Pebble. That's all

698
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,615
Speaker 6:  my, my advice to anyone. He reached out to this developer,

699
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:55,215
Speaker 6:  contracted with him, turns out it's a 16-year-old high school kid. Yes.

700
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:58,815
Speaker 6:  Hires him Part-time to develop this into

701
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:03,655
Speaker 6:  a full fledged app. So now what we have today is a new app

702
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:07,615
Speaker 6:  called, they're calling it Beeper. Mini for now it is an iMessage client

703
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:11,015
Speaker 6:  for Android. And it is exactly what that says. It is

704
00:41:11,715 --> 00:41:15,655
Speaker 6:  you, you install it on your Android phone. You don't even have to sign in

705
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:19,375
Speaker 6:  with an Apple id. It talks to Apple servers, takes your phone number

706
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,095
Speaker 6:  and turns it into a blue bubble on IO iOS

707
00:41:23,095 --> 00:41:26,775
Speaker 6:  devices or Mac, whoever you're messaging. And it does it all locally

708
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,495
Speaker 6:  without a server relay server involved. And the way that they kind of reverse

709
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:33,805
Speaker 6:  engineered it is a fascinating process. I strongly, strongly recommend going

710
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:37,685
Speaker 6:  to check out Snazzy Hugh's video on it because he explains step by step,

711
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:41,725
Speaker 6:  and frankly it's above my head how it all works. But they end up

712
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:45,925
Speaker 6:  spoofing serial numbers of real Apple devices, which

713
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:49,125
Speaker 6:  is a technique that's been around for a long time in the Macintosh world

714
00:41:49,505 --> 00:41:53,485
Speaker 6:  and in other applications in order to get Apple software to run on things

715
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:57,165
Speaker 6:  that maybe Apple doesn't formally approve. Apple's kind of just

716
00:41:57,165 --> 00:42:00,885
Speaker 6:  always ignored it and left it alone. But they're using this now

717
00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:04,765
Speaker 6:  to basically spoof iMessage onto Android and allow you to

718
00:42:04,785 --> 00:42:08,245
Speaker 6:  be having completely, you know, full, fully

719
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:12,285
Speaker 6:  supported, for the most part, bluebe conversations on an Android phone.

720
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:15,685
Speaker 6:  And it's, it's fascinating 'cause It works incredibly well. Yeah, because

721
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:18,805
Speaker 5:  You've used it Jake I know who wrote the piece Yeah. Has been using it and

722
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:19,645
Speaker 5:  you, you really like it.

723
00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:23,085
Speaker 6:  I think it's great. Like I, I was, I, I switched my sim fully

724
00:42:23,635 --> 00:42:27,445
Speaker 6:  from an iPhone to an Android phone and nobody noticed,

725
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:31,525
Speaker 6:  like nothing skipped a beat. Like I am still a blue bubble to all of the

726
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:35,485
Speaker 6:  iPhone contacts I've ever had. And now I can message with

727
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:39,365
Speaker 6:  RCS and Google Messages app to Android users and

728
00:42:39,805 --> 00:42:43,285
Speaker 6:  I like don't get left outta group messages. I don't get missed

729
00:42:43,285 --> 00:42:47,245
Speaker 6:  notifications on reactions. I, if I wanted to send voice

730
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:50,965
Speaker 6:  messages I could. Like all of those features are supported. It's just

731
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:51,485
Speaker 6:  fascinating

732
00:42:51,555 --> 00:42:54,525
Speaker 5:  When somebody says congratulations. Do you also now get the balloons

733
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:58,685
Speaker 6:  So you don't get the iMessage reactions? I think that's called, you

734
00:42:58,685 --> 00:43:01,885
Speaker 6:  don't hit that. I believe they said they were working on that. They're working

735
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:05,765
Speaker 6:  on actually integrating FaceTime somehow, which I don't know how

736
00:43:05,765 --> 00:43:09,605
Speaker 6:  they're gonna do. And the one thing that they don't ever anticipate ever

737
00:43:09,605 --> 00:43:12,325
Speaker 6:  being able to support are the iMessage apps and games which,

738
00:43:12,785 --> 00:43:13,485
Speaker 5:  Oh no, sorry,

739
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:14,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Big loss.

740
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:16,965
Speaker 4:  Oh no, not iMessage Apps and games. The

741
00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:20,885
Speaker 6:  IMessage experience that most people think about on their

742
00:43:20,885 --> 00:43:23,325
Speaker 6:  iPhones is now fully replicated on Android.

743
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:27,525
Speaker 4:  What happens if you have a mixed group of some Android phones,

744
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,645
Speaker 4:  some Beeper Mini and some iPhones, you just fall back to

745
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:34,085
Speaker 6:  Sms. So the Beeper Mini is going to act as an iMessage in that and the iPhones

746
00:43:34,085 --> 00:43:36,325
Speaker 6:  are gonna act as an iMessage in that and everything's just gonna fall back

747
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:39,885
Speaker 6:  to SMS. And so that would go through your SMS app, probably Google

748
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:43,245
Speaker 6:  messages on your Android phone. 'cause it's just gonna be an SMS conversation

749
00:43:43,475 --> 00:43:47,085
Speaker 5:  When you text someone, are you getting the texts both to your Bieber app

750
00:43:47,145 --> 00:43:49,485
Speaker 5:  and to the regular text app? No. Oh, that's

751
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:53,365
Speaker 6:  Cool. If you are iMessaging someone that see the app can like tell if

752
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:57,285
Speaker 6:  you're talking to an iMessage client and so it

753
00:43:57,285 --> 00:44:01,085
Speaker 6:  just, your iMessage conversation stays entirely within Ber Mini. If someone

754
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:04,925
Speaker 6:  sends you a text message, it will come through your text

755
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:07,445
Speaker 6:  message number through Google Messages. So,

756
00:44:07,835 --> 00:44:11,405
Speaker 5:  Well, I was, I was thinking like the, the, the, the, the example Neil I had

757
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:14,405
Speaker 5:  where he was like, okay, what happens if you've got a Beeper person and an

758
00:44:14,405 --> 00:44:18,285
Speaker 5:  Android person and an i i iMessage person? Then where

759
00:44:18,285 --> 00:44:20,725
Speaker 5:  does that message, like it goes to the Beeper app because

760
00:44:20,945 --> 00:44:23,325
Speaker 4:  No, it goes to ssm it falls back to it.

761
00:44:23,325 --> 00:44:26,885
Speaker 6:  It you in that scenario, you the Beeper Mini user are using

762
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:31,005
Speaker 6:  SMS. Yeah. And so the, the, like, the annoying part of this is that you

763
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,165
Speaker 6:  now have two apps for messaging. You have your iMessage app and you have

764
00:44:34,165 --> 00:44:37,965
Speaker 6:  your Google Messages app. And beeper's plan is

765
00:44:37,965 --> 00:44:41,605
Speaker 6:  to, the original Beeper app was like, kind of like an an all in one message

766
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:45,005
Speaker 6:  service. So all it integrated all of your message services. Beeper Mini is

767
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:48,245
Speaker 6:  strictly iMessage for now. Their plan is to integrate all of those other

768
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:51,845
Speaker 6:  plugins into the Mini app, eventually drop the Mini name

769
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:55,925
Speaker 6:  and Sunset. The old app is the, the ultimate plan. But for today you, you're

770
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:56,485
Speaker 6:  using two apps

771
00:44:56,745 --> 00:44:59,765
Speaker 4:  And the claim here, which I think is important, we don't know if it's true,

772
00:44:59,785 --> 00:45:03,605
Speaker 4:  but the claim is that Apple can't stop it without completely rebuilding the

773
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:04,525
Speaker 4:  iMessage protocol. Yeah.

774
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:09,405
Speaker 5:  I'm I'm really curious. I think because I keep getting stuck on the spoofing

775
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:12,685
Speaker 5:  part of this, like with Hack Andt toss, I used to, I I built a lot of Hack

776
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:16,605
Speaker 5:  Andt tos when I was younger. I love it. It's a fairly small community. So

777
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:18,205
Speaker 5:  it was like, okay Apple, we, we were all like, well

778
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:20,805
Speaker 4:  Apple, the police are coming now. Yeah. We understand that Craig Gregory

779
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:22,845
Speaker 4:  just was listening to this. He just called the police. Yeah.

780
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:25,645
Speaker 5:  My poor dog's getting arrested as we speak at home.

781
00:45:27,345 --> 00:45:30,885
Speaker 5:  But, but it was, it was super easy to do. It was a lot of fun. but it was

782
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:34,085
Speaker 5:  also understood that like, it's a very small community so it wasn't really

783
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:37,205
Speaker 5:  a big deal and it wasn't like a bunch of money was exchanging hands. You

784
00:45:37,205 --> 00:45:39,925
Speaker 5:  weren't being like, build me a Macintosh. 'cause as soon as you did that,

785
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:41,845
Speaker 5:  apple came down. You own like

786
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:45,605
Speaker 6:  Well, so the difference there is with Hack andt tos, it's usually you have

787
00:45:45,605 --> 00:45:49,245
Speaker 6:  to go acquire Apple's software and install it on a device

788
00:45:49,385 --> 00:45:53,365
Speaker 6:  and there's no real legal way to get that software

789
00:45:53,365 --> 00:45:57,175
Speaker 6:  if you're getting like OSS 10 leopard or whatever. Yeah.

790
00:45:57,205 --> 00:46:00,095
Speaker 6:  Without getting it from Apple. And Apple's not gonna give it to you if You

791
00:46:00,095 --> 00:46:02,855
Speaker 6:  don't have a max. So you have to like basically torrent it. Well

792
00:46:02,855 --> 00:46:06,455
Speaker 5:  That's why we all, like everybody I knew who did it had a Mac,

793
00:46:06,675 --> 00:46:09,735
Speaker 5:  we just wanted to also have a tiny Dell latitude that

794
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:11,095
Speaker 4:  Can I, can I tell you a story from a youth?

795
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:12,015
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

796
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:15,655
Speaker 4:  So there was a company in Florida called S Star. Do you remember this? Yes,

797
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:19,095
Speaker 4:  I do. And it was like two kids and they figured out how to build Macintosh's

798
00:46:19,315 --> 00:46:23,135
Speaker 4:  and they did in early like internet marketing

799
00:46:23,335 --> 00:46:26,735
Speaker 4:  campaign where like, take down the man run OSS 10 on yours side star, we

800
00:46:26,735 --> 00:46:30,505
Speaker 4:  can do it. And they had all these like I would call them

801
00:46:30,565 --> 00:46:34,545
Speaker 4:  Reddit caliber legal theories Yes. About how it would be legal and how

802
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:38,185
Speaker 4:  they would defeat Apple in court and they would, you know, I had a s side

803
00:46:38,185 --> 00:46:42,065
Speaker 4:  star review, a S star for End Gadget. It was just a pc. Yeah,

804
00:46:42,245 --> 00:46:45,665
Speaker 4:  it was, I was like, I was like, what am I supposed to review here? Like it

805
00:46:45,665 --> 00:46:49,545
Speaker 4:  was just a noisy ass tower PC that like sometimes

806
00:46:49,755 --> 00:46:51,745
Speaker 4:  boots up into OSS 10. That's what

807
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:52,065
Speaker 5:  I used

808
00:46:52,065 --> 00:46:56,025
Speaker 4:  To build and sometimes does nothing. It it

809
00:46:56,025 --> 00:46:59,025
Speaker 4:  was exciting. But they had all these theories that like if you owned a copy

810
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:03,025
Speaker 4:  of the operating system, you weren't committing copyright

811
00:47:03,025 --> 00:47:04,985
Speaker 4:  infringement or breaching the contract by

812
00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:08,865
Speaker 5:  That's what we would all say in the, it was like Tony Mack 86 X

813
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:12,225
Speaker 5:  forum Yeah. Or whatever. We'd all be like, oh yeah, yeah, we're we're fine

814
00:47:12,225 --> 00:47:15,385
Speaker 5:  because we already own it. Like, I went out and I had, I had the physical

815
00:47:15,385 --> 00:47:19,345
Speaker 5:  copy of each DV cd Yeah. For the OSS that you could have until they stopped

816
00:47:19,985 --> 00:47:23,905
Speaker 5:  distributing 'em. And we were like, we got this. But we also generally,

817
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:26,025
Speaker 5:  unlike S Star, weren't charging for it.

818
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:29,525
Speaker 4:  No S star is like charging money and got but this, this is like, like folk

819
00:47:29,635 --> 00:47:33,445
Speaker 4:  copyright law. Yeah. Like you've convinced yourself that if you just

820
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:37,405
Speaker 4:  buy the CD you can make, you can send as many MP threes to your

821
00:47:37,405 --> 00:47:38,605
Speaker 4:  friends as you want. Yeah. It is.

822
00:47:38,835 --> 00:47:42,125
Speaker 5:  Same thing with torrents. They're always like, no, no, we're fine. We're

823
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,405
Speaker 4:  Fine. Yeah. And it, and it is all just like you're, you are concocting like

824
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:49,365
Speaker 4:  a moral argument that somewhere some money has

825
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:50,765
Speaker 4:  changed hands. So, I can do whatever think

826
00:47:50,765 --> 00:47:52,045
Speaker 5:  Clarence Thomas will ignore. Yeah.

827
00:47:52,155 --> 00:47:54,085
Speaker 4:  It's Who knows what's gonna happen man.

828
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:58,925
Speaker 4:  But, but my end of mys star story is they, they pitched themselves a bunch

829
00:47:59,065 --> 00:48:01,565
Speaker 4:  and they, you know, they were compelling. They were like young kids. They

830
00:48:01,565 --> 00:48:03,685
Speaker 4:  started a business, they were taking on the man. They gotten all this attention

831
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:07,805
Speaker 4:  and some like local Florida Alt Weekly

832
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:12,245
Speaker 4:  wrote this piece about how they were taken on Apple and who knew what happened.

833
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:15,525
Speaker 4:  Oh. And So I wrote it up in Eng Gadget. I was like, I can't believe they

834
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:19,325
Speaker 4:  conned. I called, I called it a puff piece. Yeah. I was likes a big puff

835
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:23,165
Speaker 4:  piece about side star like fun. Look at these guys. But they're doomed.

836
00:48:23,385 --> 00:48:27,085
Speaker 4:  And the reporter and I I was like a baby blogger. Yeah. The

837
00:48:27,245 --> 00:48:30,405
Speaker 4:  reporter wrote me just like the most hammer email,

838
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:35,205
Speaker 4:  like, how dare you, I would never write a puff piece. These are

839
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:38,405
Speaker 4:  valid issues. And I was like, I don know how to break this to you. Like this

840
00:48:38,405 --> 00:48:41,965
Speaker 4:  company's not gonna make like five minutes. And sure enough, apple sued them.

841
00:48:42,205 --> 00:48:46,125
Speaker 4:  Then it went away immediately. And I was like, that was crazy. but it

842
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:50,085
Speaker 4:  was, it was all based on this argument that like, if you did one right thing

843
00:48:50,155 --> 00:48:53,965
Speaker 4:  once, then you could do the wrong thing as many times as you wanted. Yeah.

844
00:48:54,145 --> 00:48:58,085
Speaker 4:  And I think the difference with Beeper is they're not using any of Apple's

845
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:01,845
Speaker 4:  code. Right? They're not, they're just sending Apple a number.

846
00:49:02,615 --> 00:49:05,005
Speaker 4:  Right. That happens to be a serial number.

847
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:10,275
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's tough. And the, the reverse engineering is legal

848
00:49:10,535 --> 00:49:14,195
Speaker 6:  and protected. Like that is like a, a valid thing to do. It's particular,

849
00:49:14,315 --> 00:49:17,635
Speaker 6:  particularly when it comes to enabling interoperability, which is like the

850
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:21,595
Speaker 6:  whole hinging thing here, enables interoperability for

851
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:23,075
Speaker 6:  iMessage on Android devices.

852
00:49:23,565 --> 00:49:26,195
Speaker 4:  There is another law that could get in their way.

853
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:30,795
Speaker 4:  It's just like, it's there, it's always lurking in the background. It's like

854
00:49:30,795 --> 00:49:34,195
Speaker 4:  one of the worst laws in the books. It's a computer fraud and abuse act

855
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:38,905
Speaker 4:  that says if you wrongfully gain access to a system that is

856
00:49:38,945 --> 00:49:39,785
Speaker 4:  a criminal penalty.

857
00:49:39,975 --> 00:49:43,865
Speaker 5:  Well, this was how all the bios, they would reverse engineer the bios

858
00:49:43,865 --> 00:49:46,905
Speaker 5:  back in the eighties and you're like, had to be in a different room from

859
00:49:46,905 --> 00:49:48,265
Speaker 5:  the people reverse engineering it. Right.

860
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:51,905
Speaker 6:  This is Cranz, this is a plot point of halt and catch fire.

861
00:49:52,045 --> 00:49:55,985
Speaker 5:  It is a plot point, but it's also true. It really happened. That's why it

862
00:49:55,985 --> 00:49:57,305
Speaker 5:  was such a good plot point, one

863
00:49:57,305 --> 00:50:00,745
Speaker 6:  Of the best shows ever made. but it is a, a whole plot line of it. It's very

864
00:50:00,745 --> 00:50:01,145
Speaker 6:  cool. I

865
00:50:01,305 --> 00:50:03,945
Speaker 5:  Remember being really excited. I was like, they're doing it, they're doing

866
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:04,905
Speaker 5:  Bios law.

867
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:09,625
Speaker 6:  But you know, again, it's a, the, the technical side of this is really

868
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:13,585
Speaker 6:  kind of above my head, but Quinn over at snazzy q in his

869
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:17,305
Speaker 6:  breakdown video, and he, like, he installs the open source

870
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:21,145
Speaker 6:  code on a Linux laptop and connects to the protocol and like

871
00:50:21,145 --> 00:50:25,065
Speaker 6:  does the thing as It works to show what it's doing behind the

872
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:29,005
Speaker 6:  like polished app that you see on Android. And it's really quite fascinating.

873
00:50:29,035 --> 00:50:32,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. He makes a point that spoofing the serial numbers does have

874
00:50:33,005 --> 00:50:36,845
Speaker 6:  a number of legitimate use cases and there's no way for Apple

875
00:50:36,945 --> 00:50:40,685
Speaker 6:  to know whether this serial number that you are sending them

876
00:50:41,145 --> 00:50:45,045
Speaker 6:  is the 2015 iMac 21.5

877
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:48,565
Speaker 6:  inch model that it was originally, or it's your Android phone. So course

878
00:50:48,565 --> 00:50:52,445
Speaker 6:  Apple can't tell that. So if Apple were to like turn

879
00:50:52,445 --> 00:50:56,005
Speaker 6:  that off, it would break a lot of things for legitimate users. So that's

880
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:57,805
Speaker 6:  kind of where the the rub is.

881
00:50:58,065 --> 00:51:00,845
Speaker 4:  But because the code is public, because the activity is public, apple could

882
00:51:00,845 --> 00:51:04,245
Speaker 4:  certainly sue Beeper and say you are improperly

883
00:51:04,355 --> 00:51:08,325
Speaker 4:  accessing the iMessage servers that you are not supposed to have access to.

884
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:12,365
Speaker 4:  And there is a long line of cases, like everything in America

885
00:51:12,755 --> 00:51:16,405
Speaker 4:  have total coin flip outcomes once you hit the Supreme court.

886
00:51:17,135 --> 00:51:21,085
Speaker 4:  Right. Like at and t won a case and the characters involved in

887
00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:24,965
Speaker 4:  the case are somewhat unsavory. But at and t won a case for someone who

888
00:51:24,965 --> 00:51:28,325
Speaker 4:  was just hitting the at t website to do lookups over and over again.

889
00:51:28,825 --> 00:51:32,725
Speaker 4:  And that was A-C-F-A-A case. LinkedIn just lost a case to

890
00:51:32,725 --> 00:51:36,685
Speaker 4:  an analytics company called hiq that was scraping the

891
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:40,325
Speaker 4:  LinkedIn database. And it's like, well that seems wrong with an IQ one. The

892
00:51:40,325 --> 00:51:43,525
Speaker 4:  Supreme court just took another case where a police officer improperly did

893
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:46,765
Speaker 4:  a lookup, like someone paid him money to use the police database to do a

894
00:51:46,765 --> 00:51:50,485
Speaker 4:  lookup. I don know, but he had, he was authorized to use the database. He

895
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:54,085
Speaker 4:  just did it in an unapproved way. And like you just, like, if there's a server

896
00:51:54,185 --> 00:51:57,565
Speaker 4:  on the internet and you talk to it and it tells you something, there's a

897
00:51:57,565 --> 00:52:00,965
Speaker 4:  million different ways to parse out whether that is legal or not legal.

898
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:04,925
Speaker 5:  So does, how big is beeper's legal fund, I think is the real question we

899
00:52:04,925 --> 00:52:05,365
Speaker 5:  need to be asking

900
00:52:05,565 --> 00:52:08,565
Speaker 4:  The que here's, there's a couple questions right next to this. The EU decided

901
00:52:08,565 --> 00:52:12,445
Speaker 4:  this week that Apple did not have to treat iMessage

902
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:16,005
Speaker 4:  as a, a platform that has to be interoperable. Like did Meta

903
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:17,325
Speaker 4:  with WhatsApp, did

904
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:19,645
Speaker 5:  They decide or they just leaned in that I thought they've just leaned in

905
00:52:19,645 --> 00:52:20,125
Speaker 5:  that direction.

906
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:20,765
Speaker 4:  They've signaled

907
00:52:21,045 --> 00:52:21,805
Speaker 5:  Signaled Yeah.

908
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:25,205
Speaker 4:  European politics. There's a lot of signaling posturing. Yeah. You rotate

909
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:25,845
Speaker 4:  a piece of cheese

910
00:52:26,025 --> 00:52:28,685
Speaker 5:  And everybody's like, yes, thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

911
00:52:28,835 --> 00:52:30,885
Speaker 4:  It's like, oh, debris has turned to the left. Thank you. I message will not

912
00:52:30,885 --> 00:52:33,645
Speaker 4:  be a gatekeeper service. Like that's like, it seems like that's not gonna

913
00:52:33,645 --> 00:52:36,685
Speaker 4:  happen. That is almost certainly because

914
00:52:38,135 --> 00:52:42,005
Speaker 4:  Apple agreed to adopt RRCs. Right, right. Which was the gambit. And

915
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:44,885
Speaker 4:  and I think we all saw that as the trade. Like there's the threat of this

916
00:52:44,885 --> 00:52:48,125
Speaker 4:  big interop regulation. Or they could do RRCs and say, look, it's interoperable

917
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:51,645
Speaker 4:  this way. Great. They did it. So that's sort of the background here.

918
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,205
Speaker 4:  Like Apple's gonna say, look, there's an interoperable way it's coming, we're

919
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:59,045
Speaker 4:  gonna use it. Maybe only four people ever use paper and the, or maybe

920
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,685
Speaker 4:  they just, Apple's pretty litigious. Maybe they just send a threat to this

921
00:53:01,685 --> 00:53:05,405
Speaker 4:  company and say, stop it. But the need to stop it

922
00:53:05,785 --> 00:53:09,645
Speaker 4:  or Apple's desire to stop it is going to cause problems. Yeah. Because

923
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:13,535
Speaker 4:  they don't actually have the RCS implementation yet. And so

924
00:53:13,595 --> 00:53:17,095
Speaker 4:  to say we we're gonna keep people locked out of our service while we work

925
00:53:17,095 --> 00:53:19,535
Speaker 4:  on this other thing. I think it's just gonna be, and it's an indie developer

926
00:53:19,535 --> 00:53:23,015
Speaker 4:  that's really well liked. It got a lot of press because a lot of Android

927
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:25,540
Speaker 4:  people in this country really wanna send high messages and they're gonna

928
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,885
Speaker 4:  pay Beeper $2 a month or whatever it is to, to do it. They should have solved

929
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:32,645
Speaker 4:  this problem a million years ago. They should have found a way to do this

930
00:53:32,665 --> 00:53:36,125
Speaker 4:  on their terms a million years ago because now they're doing it on the terms

931
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:39,725
Speaker 4:  of the European Union and somewhat improbably on the terms

932
00:53:41,425 --> 00:53:44,685
Speaker 4:  Kowski and Beeper Mini. Which is just weird.

933
00:53:45,035 --> 00:53:45,765
Speaker 5:  It's a delight.

934
00:53:46,345 --> 00:53:50,245
Speaker 4:  And this is a 16-year-old kid who reverse engineering the protocol and is

935
00:53:50,245 --> 00:53:54,185
Speaker 4:  like spare time. Like that's a weird place for the richest company

936
00:53:54,185 --> 00:53:55,185
Speaker 4:  in the world to be Yeah.

937
00:53:55,405 --> 00:53:56,745
Speaker 5:  Go after that 16-year-old kid.

938
00:53:57,655 --> 00:54:00,905
Speaker 4:  This is the thing, you wanna file the CFA lawsuit against the 16-year-old

939
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:04,505
Speaker 4:  kid for a reverse engineering thing. Like you're the bad guy. That's just

940
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:05,225
Speaker 4:  straight up. You're the bad

941
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:08,345
Speaker 5:  Guy. Yeah. I mean that's what Sony did, right? With the, I think it was a

942
00:54:08,365 --> 00:54:08,745
Speaker 5:  PSS three.

943
00:54:09,175 --> 00:54:11,425
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This is the legend of Geo of George Hots.

944
00:54:11,425 --> 00:54:13,345
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Like mm. Don't maybe don't do that.

945
00:54:13,895 --> 00:54:16,305
Speaker 4:  Well, the George Hots did work, it did work in Twitter for five minutes.

946
00:54:18,445 --> 00:54:22,265
Speaker 4:  All. right. So that's that other big piece of news we should talk about this

947
00:54:22,265 --> 00:54:26,105
Speaker 4:  week. It seems like podcast industry is in turmoil. Spotify just had

948
00:54:26,105 --> 00:54:29,345
Speaker 4:  layoffs. They're canceling really popular shows, including a show that won

949
00:54:29,905 --> 00:54:33,785
Speaker 4:  a Pulitzer Prize. They canceled Heavyweight, the title laid off 10 percent

950
00:54:33,785 --> 00:54:37,225
Speaker 4:  of its staff. It just seems like in general podcasts,

951
00:54:37,815 --> 00:54:40,665
Speaker 4:  they had the big tech moment where all the money from the big tech companies

952
00:54:40,665 --> 00:54:44,185
Speaker 4:  particularly Spotify, rushed in. Yes. And now the Tide has

953
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:48,185
Speaker 5:  Come back out. It's like Spotify rushed in with zero plan. And

954
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:52,065
Speaker 5:  then when the, the gravy train like did not continue the plan,

955
00:54:52,265 --> 00:54:55,985
Speaker 5:  continue the plan was celebrities. The plan was own this

956
00:54:55,985 --> 00:54:59,905
Speaker 5:  entire industry as quickly as possible, like grow so fast,

957
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,585
Speaker 5:  so big that nobody can stop us and we're a Tidal wave. And then like,

958
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,785
Speaker 5:  we'll be supported by all our ad dollars and the ad dollars are like, no,

959
00:55:06,995 --> 00:55:08,705
Speaker 5:  we're not gonna support you that much. Right.

960
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:11,865
Speaker 4:  And they bought an ad tech company. Yeah. And they wanted to do dynamic insertion

961
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:12,425
Speaker 4:  of ads because they were

962
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:14,625
Speaker 5:  Trying to own the whole ad tech industry side of Spotify

963
00:55:15,035 --> 00:55:18,585
Speaker 4:  Disclosure. Our ads are served by Spotify, sadd tech platform,

964
00:55:18,775 --> 00:55:19,385
Speaker 4:  megaphone

965
00:55:19,475 --> 00:55:20,705
Speaker 5:  Disclosure. We're a podcast,

966
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,425
Speaker 4:  I don't even know what I'm disclosing there. Like someone uploads this to

967
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:28,145
Speaker 4:  this thing and we use it. Yeah. It's great. Someone else runs the ads, but

968
00:55:28,175 --> 00:55:32,105
Speaker 4:  it's true. There's a disclosure. The whole story to me is they thought

969
00:55:32,105 --> 00:55:35,985
Speaker 4:  they could take a big, rich, open ecosystem and

970
00:55:35,985 --> 00:55:39,865
Speaker 4:  turn it into a very closed one. Yes. You could turn Spotify in

971
00:55:39,865 --> 00:55:42,545
Speaker 4:  the open podcasting ecosystem into something that looked a lot more like

972
00:55:42,545 --> 00:55:45,035
Speaker 4:  YouTube. And I, I think it just didn't work.

973
00:55:45,035 --> 00:55:48,715
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I, I a hundred percent agree. I think they, they fail. Like, and we

974
00:55:48,715 --> 00:55:52,155
Speaker 5:  all kind of knew this, remember Ashley came on, Ashley Carmen now at Bloomberg

975
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:53,755
Speaker 5:  broke a lot of this stuff about Spotify,

976
00:55:53,885 --> 00:55:55,195
Speaker 4:  Nobel Trader Ashley Carmen, yeah.

977
00:55:55,675 --> 00:55:59,635
Speaker 5:  Horrible trader. But came on this very podcast like what, two years ago talking

978
00:55:59,635 --> 00:56:02,075
Speaker 5:  about this. And we were all like, Ooh, this doesn't sound like it's gonna

979
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:06,155
Speaker 5:  work for Spotify. It feels like they're just ignoring everything else

980
00:56:06,165 --> 00:56:10,155
Speaker 5:  about this and why this is a bad idea. It feels like we were All right. High

981
00:56:10,155 --> 00:56:12,515
Speaker 5:  five all of us two years ago. Yes.

982
00:56:13,145 --> 00:56:17,115
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean obviously they've held onto Joe Rogan. His deal is up

983
00:56:17,115 --> 00:56:19,715
Speaker 4:  for renewal. We have been told. So we're tracking That

984
00:56:19,855 --> 00:56:21,395
Speaker 5:  Did not hold onto Prince Harry and Meghan,

985
00:56:21,495 --> 00:56:24,445
Speaker 4:  Meghan and Harry didn't make it. You know, there's something interesting

986
00:56:24,445 --> 00:56:27,925
Speaker 4:  there. You know, the, the tech industry loves Talk about going direct. Yeah.

987
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:30,725
Speaker 4:  Like, loves to talk about going direct. You don't need these journalists

988
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:34,245
Speaker 4:  or Pepsi. And it's like if you go direct and you have nothing to say,

989
00:56:34,665 --> 00:56:37,405
Speaker 4:  no one will listen to you and you will have gone direct to no one. Which

990
00:56:37,405 --> 00:56:40,125
Speaker 4:  is truly the Harry and Meghan story. Like

991
00:56:40,955 --> 00:56:42,445
Speaker 4:  they're out of things to say.

992
00:56:42,795 --> 00:56:45,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They, they did the book. We were all like, thank you. This is actually

993
00:56:45,605 --> 00:56:47,565
Speaker 5:  all we wanted from you. Yeah. We just wanted the tea.

994
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:51,565
Speaker 4:  And I'm not even someone who, like, I'm Indian American. My people

995
00:56:51,565 --> 00:56:55,205
Speaker 4:  have fled the British twice. Like we just get out and I,

996
00:56:55,725 --> 00:56:59,125
Speaker 4:  I do not care about any of this, but it's like even the people I know who

997
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:03,125
Speaker 4:  do care, and we have them on our staff, Liz Lippa and Sarah Jog love

998
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,685
Speaker 4:  some royal family drama and they're like, whatever we're done with this.

999
00:57:06,145 --> 00:57:09,845
Speaker 4:  And like that to me is you need some tension

1000
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:14,005
Speaker 4:  to tell a good story. Yeah. And like that's, you buy a bunch of the celebrities

1001
00:57:14,245 --> 00:57:17,725
Speaker 4:  directly, you're not gonna have any tension. Every celebrity podcast is like

1002
00:57:17,765 --> 00:57:20,165
Speaker 4:  a celebrity and then someone else just needling them. Well,

1003
00:57:20,165 --> 00:57:24,085
Speaker 5:  Or there's there, the new trend now is it's the d-list

1004
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:27,645
Speaker 5:  celebrities that were on the shows with the really big folks. They all get

1005
00:57:27,765 --> 00:57:30,645
Speaker 5:  together and then talk trash about the big folks. Yeah. And then sometimes

1006
00:57:30,645 --> 00:57:34,605
Speaker 5:  talk about like how they slept with the entire cast. And you're like a lot

1007
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:35,325
Speaker 5:  of Disney channel

1008
00:57:37,435 --> 00:57:41,405
Speaker 5:  your face. We're like, why don't get into the podcast

1009
00:57:41,455 --> 00:57:43,685
Speaker 5:  scene guys. There's so many, like Disney channel

1010
00:57:43,855 --> 00:57:46,245
Speaker 4:  Tells we're ending this podcast before we, before we go that way.

1011
00:57:46,485 --> 00:57:50,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We're we're, we won't do that. It's wild though. That's the new trend

1012
00:57:50,045 --> 00:57:51,485
Speaker 5:  for celebrity podcasts. Yeah.

1013
00:57:51,785 --> 00:57:55,285
Speaker 4:  All of that seems like it didn't work. Just to be clear. Like Spotify burned

1014
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:59,245
Speaker 4:  millions of dollars in this. They torched Gimlet, which was a darling,

1015
00:57:59,245 --> 00:58:02,885
Speaker 4:  it was failing as a company. And obviously they sold the Spotify for

1016
00:58:03,245 --> 00:58:07,205
Speaker 4:  tons and tons of money that they had no plan themselves to, to gain because

1017
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:10,845
Speaker 4:  they were failing as a company. So good, good on them. but it also broke

1018
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:14,365
Speaker 4:  Gimlet. It broke reply all, it broke the culture of that company

1019
00:58:15,145 --> 00:58:19,045
Speaker 4:  at, at some point. Like the mergers are just bad. The acquisitions are

1020
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:22,965
Speaker 4:  just bad. And I think this feels like they bought Gimlet, they bought podcast,

1021
00:58:23,075 --> 00:58:26,845
Speaker 4:  they bought Anchor, they bought Megaphone, and they had no plan to munge

1022
00:58:26,845 --> 00:58:30,525
Speaker 4:  them all to They bought the ringer. Yep. And the plan to mu them all together

1023
00:58:31,415 --> 00:58:32,365
Speaker 4:  seems like it just failed.

1024
00:58:33,025 --> 00:58:33,245
Speaker 5:  Yes.

1025
00:58:33,745 --> 00:58:36,725
Speaker 4:  But the stock is up and they turn their first ever profit. And it's like,

1026
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:37,485
Speaker 4:  is that all that matters?

1027
00:58:38,425 --> 00:58:40,325
Speaker 5:  Ooh. If you, if you like money. Yeah.

1028
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think we're, I think we're, I don't think podcasts are going anywhere.

1029
00:58:43,465 --> 00:58:46,165
Speaker 4:  You can see some of 'em are still growing. You can see money is flowing to

1030
00:58:46,165 --> 00:58:49,325
Speaker 4:  some categories in them, but it, it feels like we're returning

1031
00:58:50,185 --> 00:58:53,685
Speaker 4:  to a much more sustainable place to grow the podcast industry. Yes.

1032
00:58:54,275 --> 00:58:57,655
Speaker 5:  It was very unsustainable for a while. And now it's gonna be like, we are

1033
00:58:57,655 --> 00:59:01,095
Speaker 5:  only gonna support podcasts where people actually say something interesting

1034
00:59:01,865 --> 00:59:02,655
Speaker 4:  Maybe just,

1035
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:04,095
Speaker 5:  And, and also Joe Rogan

1036
00:59:05,915 --> 00:59:08,775
Speaker 4:  And then other thing, Spotify and all the other big podcast players are doing

1037
00:59:09,075 --> 00:59:11,895
Speaker 4:  is they're, they're focusing on chat shows.

1038
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:16,475
Speaker 4:  Influencer, you know, the, the, the solo podcast where the

1039
00:59:16,475 --> 00:59:19,595
Speaker 4:  influencers just ranted the screen, but it looks like a podcast. Yeah. A

1040
00:59:19,595 --> 00:59:21,245
Speaker 4:  deeply fast. Like that's a media PhD.

1041
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:23,125
Speaker 5:  That's gonna be my spinoff. If

1042
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:26,485
Speaker 4:  There are any media, PhD, any media studies students that are pursuing a

1043
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:30,205
Speaker 4:  media studies PhD, I would read your dissertation on the,

1044
00:59:30,265 --> 00:59:34,075
Speaker 4:  the one person podcast where they just talk the whole time.

1045
00:59:34,865 --> 00:59:35,515
Speaker 5:  What do they do?

1046
00:59:36,835 --> 00:59:40,755
Speaker 4:  I just, I I like to talk. Yeah, I do that. I

1047
00:59:40,755 --> 00:59:42,035
Speaker 4:  love it mean that's same. That's it's my favorite.

1048
00:59:42,035 --> 00:59:44,875
Speaker 6:  That's the AM radio model, right? Like that was the Rush Limbaugh model.

1049
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:48,675
Speaker 6:  It was the Alex Jones model. Just talk to the microphone for three hours

1050
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:48,955
Speaker 6:  straight.

1051
00:59:49,065 --> 00:59:53,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm just dying to know in podcasting to

1052
00:59:53,065 --> 00:59:56,725
Speaker 4:  do that on your own and then to like close your laptop

1053
00:59:56,865 --> 00:59:58,285
Speaker 4:  lid and be like,

1054
00:59:59,045 --> 01:00:00,805
Speaker 5:  I did it. Good

1055
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:04,045
Speaker 4:  Job. There's, there's something in there about like that personality making

1056
01:00:04,045 --> 01:00:07,685
Speaker 4:  that kind of content with that kind of distribution that I promise you as

1057
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:08,405
Speaker 4:  a PhD thesis.

1058
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:09,325
Speaker 5:  I'd

1059
01:00:09,325 --> 01:00:12,805
Speaker 4:  Read it like there's some feedback loop in there that I just want to know

1060
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:13,125
Speaker 4:  more about.

1061
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:15,845
Speaker 5:  Just send it to Neela. Send it to all of us. Honestly. I wanna read that

1062
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:15,965
Speaker 5:  too.

1063
01:00:16,635 --> 01:00:20,445
Speaker 4:  Well do it. Go get your PhD. That's what I'm telling you. That's a good use

1064
01:00:20,445 --> 01:00:24,125
Speaker 4:  of money. And then title, obviously, obviously laying Off Its staff. Again,

1065
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:27,685
Speaker 4:  another Jack Dorsey brilliantly managed company. Yeah. We love

1066
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:28,805
Speaker 5:  It. It had Beyonce for a

1067
01:00:28,805 --> 01:00:31,685
Speaker 4:  While. It did. And then last piece of little media news and we'll take a

1068
01:00:31,685 --> 01:00:35,405
Speaker 4:  break. Apple is munging together. It's iTunes movies and TV shows

1069
01:00:35,505 --> 01:00:39,205
Speaker 4:  app into the proper Apple tv, TV app.

1070
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:40,965
Speaker 4:  So now we have to use it.

1071
01:00:41,025 --> 01:00:44,805
Speaker 5:  And it was already sort of done that way. Yeah. So it's just like,

1072
01:00:44,805 --> 01:00:48,685
Speaker 5:  they're just like cleaning up the crumbs. Like the people who haven't

1073
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:51,565
Speaker 5:  really touched their workflow in 20 years are gonna be like, oh no, how am

1074
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,965
Speaker 5:  I gonna like watch my old Aquaman episodes from 2006?

1075
01:00:55,355 --> 01:00:59,325
Speaker 5:  That sucks for them. But also the rest of us have been living now

1076
01:00:59,815 --> 01:01:01,325
Speaker 5:  where you just use the one app.

1077
01:01:02,115 --> 01:01:02,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1078
01:01:03,345 --> 01:01:04,005
Speaker 5:  I'm judging people.

1079
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:07,445
Speaker 4:  What I'm doing is serious. What you mean is Plex Alex's Plex app?

1080
01:01:07,465 --> 01:01:10,285
Speaker 5:  No, it's the Apple TV app. Sure.

1081
01:01:11,285 --> 01:01:14,165
Speaker 4:  By the way, there was a, a piece of news this week. Very distressing. Sony's

1082
01:01:14,165 --> 01:01:17,445
Speaker 4:  just deleting TV shows that people bought. Yeah. On PlayStation accounts.

1083
01:01:17,495 --> 01:01:18,045
Speaker 5:  We're gonna talk

1084
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:20,125
Speaker 4:  About it later. We'll take a break. We'll get back, we'll talk about that.

1085
01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:28,835
Speaker 4:  All right? We're back sliding around time. Tell us about the Sony thing.

1086
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:29,115
Speaker 4:  Earlier

1087
01:03:29,115 --> 01:03:31,755
Speaker 5:  This week, a lot of PlayStation users noticed that they were just getting

1088
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:35,595
Speaker 5:  banned out of the blue. Like not a lot of people say, oh, I'm getting

1089
01:03:35,595 --> 01:03:39,475
Speaker 5:  banned. I don't know what happened. And you're like, no, you do. This

1090
01:03:39,475 --> 01:03:42,275
Speaker 5:  wasn't the case. They were just like totally outright band. They didn't know

1091
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:45,235
Speaker 5:  what was happening. It was a whole lot of people, which was the other part

1092
01:03:45,235 --> 01:03:49,155
Speaker 5:  of this. And so j Peters and Tom Warren looked into it and, and

1093
01:03:49,155 --> 01:03:52,915
Speaker 5:  eventually Sony was like, oops, our bad. And just slowly has been giving

1094
01:03:52,915 --> 01:03:56,315
Speaker 5:  everybody their account access back. And it was all just an accident. It

1095
01:03:56,315 --> 01:04:00,195
Speaker 5:  was just like a a a bug and they, they, they screwed up. but it also just

1096
01:04:00,195 --> 01:04:03,395
Speaker 5:  immediately reminded everyone, particularly when paired with the fact that

1097
01:04:04,105 --> 01:04:07,875
Speaker 5:  Sony also recently said, okay, a lot of this content you purchased from

1098
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:11,115
Speaker 5:  Discovery Plus you will not have access to it anymore. We've changed some

1099
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:14,915
Speaker 5:  of our licensing. It's just like a big reminder that you

1100
01:04:14,915 --> 01:04:18,795
Speaker 5:  don't own anything you buy digitally. Yeah. You, you don't own any of it.

1101
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:22,875
Speaker 5:  It's not yours. It's all licenses. It's all fake owner ownership.

1102
01:04:23,575 --> 01:04:26,675
Speaker 5:  And and Sony just accidentally reminded their entire

1103
01:04:27,785 --> 01:04:31,355
Speaker 5:  like customer's base. Yeah. Which is not what you wanna do when you are

1104
01:04:31,455 --> 01:04:35,275
Speaker 5:  highly dependent on all of, on all of them buying shit on your,

1105
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:35,795
Speaker 5:  your stores.

1106
01:04:35,825 --> 01:04:38,315
Speaker 4:  They just radicalize a lot of people into buying that dis drive.

1107
01:04:38,385 --> 01:04:39,355
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Which is

1108
01:04:39,405 --> 01:04:42,715
Speaker 4:  Maybe this is all a plot to get people to buy external dis drive. Yeah.

1109
01:04:42,715 --> 01:04:44,795
Speaker 5:  They're just trying to like move those disk drives. I'm like, All. right.

1110
01:04:45,335 --> 01:04:47,435
Speaker 4:  You're losing all, if someone opened a closet, they're like, we have a lot

1111
01:04:47,495 --> 01:04:48,355
Speaker 4:  of Blu-ray drives

1112
01:04:50,215 --> 01:04:51,675
Speaker 4:  way more than we thought You guys

1113
01:04:52,095 --> 01:04:55,195
Speaker 5:  All. right. Pull the disco plus stuff. Let's go. We got this

1114
01:04:55,455 --> 01:04:58,235
Speaker 4:  Dr. Pimple popper's outta here. We gotta move these drives.

1115
01:04:59,215 --> 01:05:03,075
Speaker 5:  But Jay wrote a really great piece just kind of lamenting it and and he's

1116
01:05:03,235 --> 01:05:06,995
Speaker 5:  absolutely right. Don't, like, if you really wanna own something

1117
01:05:07,095 --> 01:05:10,275
Speaker 5:  and you wanna own it for a long time, don't just buy the digital version.

1118
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:14,635
Speaker 5:  And a lot of times you can just go buy a DVD or a Blu-ray and get the digital

1119
01:05:14,635 --> 01:05:18,245
Speaker 5:  version. Then you have both Yeah. For the same amount of money. And

1120
01:05:18,475 --> 01:05:21,485
Speaker 4:  Look, I'm building a new home theater right now in the new house. Ooh. I'm

1121
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:23,685
Speaker 4:  really thinking about putting a Blu-ray player in it. I don't know why

1122
01:05:24,765 --> 01:05:27,985
Speaker 5:  Do it. I I've got one. Use it once a year. I you just,

1123
01:05:27,985 --> 01:05:28,465
Speaker 4:  I know you do.

1124
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,105
Speaker 5:  I plug it into my, my computer.

1125
01:05:31,105 --> 01:05:34,505
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Use it once a year to rip legal media to your

1126
01:05:35,025 --> 01:05:35,905
Speaker 4:  Plex server. You

1127
01:05:35,905 --> 01:05:39,425
Speaker 5:  Know, it's, it's folk folk copyright law. And we don't need to talk about

1128
01:05:39,425 --> 01:05:39,985
Speaker 5:  it too much here.

1129
01:05:39,985 --> 01:05:42,905
Speaker 4:  I've got a Blueray player that's been running Mac OSS nine for a decade.

1130
01:05:45,495 --> 01:05:47,825
Speaker 4:  It's great. All. right. Dan, what's your lightning round?

1131
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:52,185
Speaker 6:  I got two. Okay. Ooh. Can I do both now or, yeah. All. right. The first one

1132
01:05:52,245 --> 01:05:55,425
Speaker 6:  is, Allison did a review of the Razr,

1133
01:05:56,435 --> 01:06:00,385
Speaker 6:  which is not to be confused with the Razr plus it is Motorola's

1134
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:04,465
Speaker 6:  budget flip phone. Turns out it's not a very good phone. I'm just gonna start

1135
01:06:04,465 --> 01:06:07,865
Speaker 6:  off by saying that, but what's really fascinating to me about it is

1136
01:06:08,425 --> 01:06:12,225
Speaker 6:  this is priced at 700 bucks and because Motorola discounts things

1137
01:06:12,465 --> 01:06:16,345
Speaker 6:  a hundred percent of the time, all the time, you can buy for $500,

1138
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:19,825
Speaker 6:  which means this is a flip phone with a folding screen

1139
01:06:20,165 --> 01:06:23,905
Speaker 6:  for $500. Which is kind of like a fascinating thing to me that we are already

1140
01:06:24,045 --> 01:06:27,585
Speaker 6:  at that point of affordability of these kind of flip devices.

1141
01:06:28,205 --> 01:06:31,425
Speaker 6:  The cameras aren't great. The processors can be a little slow. The outside

1142
01:06:31,425 --> 01:06:35,345
Speaker 6:  screen is not very useful. It's not a phone I would recommend anyone buy,

1143
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:39,505
Speaker 6:  but it's pretty cool that like we've gone from, these are all a thousand

1144
01:06:39,565 --> 01:06:43,345
Speaker 6:  or $1,400 to $500 in just a couple

1145
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:47,225
Speaker 6:  years. So that was my first one. Yeah,

1146
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:51,265
Speaker 4:  It's true. And we, we, the second that first Galaxy Fold came out, we're

1147
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:54,385
Speaker 4:  like, oh, the cost curve on this is gonna go oop. Yeah. What's interesting

1148
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:57,805
Speaker 4:  is the technology curve has kind of stopped,

1149
01:06:58,495 --> 01:07:02,085
Speaker 4:  right? Like the screens are better, they're more durable. That was the big

1150
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:05,245
Speaker 4:  thing. But they look largely the same. They're

1151
01:07:05,245 --> 01:07:05,845
Speaker 5:  Still lumpy.

1152
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:10,285
Speaker 4:  Well, there's lumpy, but even just like the way the materials look

1153
01:07:10,285 --> 01:07:10,805
Speaker 4:  and feel.

1154
01:07:11,035 --> 01:07:14,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They still are soft kind of plastic. Yeah. It doesn't feel like hard

1155
01:07:14,285 --> 01:07:14,885
Speaker 6:  glass. Yeah.

1156
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:18,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And that was the, there was some, there was a lot of talk about bendy

1157
01:07:18,725 --> 01:07:20,365
Speaker 4:  glass in the beginning. Do you remember this? Yes.

1158
01:07:20,655 --> 01:07:22,325
Speaker 6:  Ultra thin glass. Yeah. Yeah.

1159
01:07:22,335 --> 01:07:23,685
Speaker 5:  Where is it? I wanna

1160
01:07:23,685 --> 01:07:27,165
Speaker 6:  See it. Well, it's all in there. It just, well the, the way they work is

1161
01:07:27,165 --> 01:07:31,085
Speaker 6:  there's a layer of ultra thin glass and then on top of that is a soft plastic

1162
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:34,165
Speaker 6:  screen protector. And that's what you touch. Yeah. And that's what provides

1163
01:07:34,165 --> 01:07:36,645
Speaker 6:  that kind of not so great tactile experience.

1164
01:07:36,945 --> 01:07:39,405
Speaker 4:  As with most things, technology kind of like make it better and keep the

1165
01:07:39,405 --> 01:07:42,565
Speaker 4:  cost the same. Or you can make, keep it the same. Keep bring the cost down.

1166
01:07:42,585 --> 01:07:45,845
Speaker 4:  And we are very much on the keep it the same, bring the cost down part of

1167
01:07:45,845 --> 01:07:49,075
Speaker 4:  the curve. There's not the step change into the part.

1168
01:07:49,075 --> 01:07:52,795
Speaker 6:  Particularly for the flip designs. The fold designs are

1169
01:07:52,795 --> 01:07:56,595
Speaker 6:  still very expensive. The one plus open

1170
01:07:56,595 --> 01:08:00,155
Speaker 6:  came out earlier this year and that is available for around $1,500.

1171
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:04,115
Speaker 6:  That's kinda like the low price for these folding

1172
01:08:04,155 --> 01:08:07,475
Speaker 6:  phones. But the flip phones, and I think it's part of

1173
01:08:07,975 --> 01:08:11,755
Speaker 6:  who these are marketed to, folding phones are marketed to like Uber,

1174
01:08:11,895 --> 01:08:15,565
Speaker 6:  do everything nerds like me. And then the flip phones are marketed to people

1175
01:08:15,565 --> 01:08:18,525
Speaker 6:  who want something a little bit more fashionable, a little bit more compact,

1176
01:08:18,645 --> 01:08:22,525
Speaker 6:  discreet, don't wanna spend 10 to 12 hours a day staring at

1177
01:08:22,525 --> 01:08:26,125
Speaker 6:  their phone like I do. And, and wanna make it more of like an intentional

1178
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:29,405
Speaker 6:  device. And so they don't need the fastest processor, they don't need the

1179
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:32,205
Speaker 6:  highest end camera system. They don't need the bills and whistles to run

1180
01:08:32,255 --> 01:08:36,205
Speaker 6:  decks and things like that. even that, I think Motorola lets

1181
01:08:36,205 --> 01:08:39,685
Speaker 6:  you run its version of Dex, which is called ready for on its flip phones.

1182
01:08:40,225 --> 01:08:42,125
Speaker 6:  So, hey, that's the thing you could do, Eli.

1183
01:08:42,305 --> 01:08:46,045
Speaker 4:  Hey, I wanna see that next doc with a Motorola flip.

1184
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:49,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. Bad camera, slow processor.

1185
01:08:50,615 --> 01:08:53,645
Speaker 4:  Great. Okay. You all knew this was gonna be my lightning round.

1186
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:58,565
Speaker 4:  You knew it. There was no choice except for this story to

1187
01:08:58,565 --> 01:09:01,765
Speaker 4:  be my lightning round item, which is the photo of the woman in the, in the

1188
01:09:01,865 --> 01:09:03,245
Speaker 4:  bridal gown. Like

1189
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:07,125
Speaker 5:  I saw it and I, I, as soon as the news broke, what, earlier this week, I

1190
01:09:07,125 --> 01:09:07,485
Speaker 5:  was like, Hmm,

1191
01:09:07,905 --> 01:09:10,125
Speaker 4:  You know what? I'm coming. The news broke a couple weeks ago. Did you? A

1192
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:12,845
Speaker 4:  couple weeks ago. And then OpenAI happened and we forgot about it. Yeah.

1193
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:16,005
Speaker 4:  So this photo, there's a photo of a woman she's trying on a wedding dress.

1194
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:19,005
Speaker 4:  She's in the bridal shots. one of those, there's mirrors all around her.

1195
01:09:19,005 --> 01:09:21,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like you do. So you can see yourself from all the angles and she's

1196
01:09:21,805 --> 01:09:25,575
Speaker 4:  making a different pose in all the mirrors. And then in person, she's a British

1197
01:09:25,935 --> 01:09:29,855
Speaker 4:  comedian. She posted her Instagram story. She said, this is crazy. I've

1198
01:09:29,855 --> 01:09:33,375
Speaker 4:  never had anything like this happen. The immediate

1199
01:09:33,465 --> 01:09:37,375
Speaker 4:  theorizing about AI photo composites

1200
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:41,295
Speaker 4:  started happening. Smart HDR, she said she went to the Apple store. Someone,

1201
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:45,295
Speaker 4:  some Apple store employee told her this was Apple beta testing a competitor,

1202
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:47,495
Speaker 4:  a best take on Google, which makes no sense.

1203
01:09:49,005 --> 01:09:51,975
Speaker 4:  This is all true. This all happened. Right. This is all in her Instagram

1204
01:09:51,975 --> 01:09:54,775
Speaker 4:  stories and Instagram post. Yeah. Tom Warren, because she's in the UK. Tom

1205
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:57,175
Speaker 4:  Warren reached out to her. I was like, we gotta get the actual photo we got.

1206
01:09:57,175 --> 01:10:01,015
Speaker 4:  And then he reached out to her, he got the photo, we were talking

1207
01:10:01,015 --> 01:10:04,775
Speaker 4:  about it. Then the opening eye news broke. Tom is our Microsoft

1208
01:10:05,175 --> 01:10:09,015
Speaker 4:  reporter. He and I got very distracted, very busy. We stopped

1209
01:10:09,015 --> 01:10:12,775
Speaker 4:  paying attention to the woman in her wedding dress for a minute. The, the

1210
01:10:12,805 --> 01:10:16,775
Speaker 4:  Post came back this week. People saw it

1211
01:10:16,775 --> 01:10:20,455
Speaker 4:  again, all the same amount of theorizing that happened, people calling it

1212
01:10:20,455 --> 01:10:24,215
Speaker 4:  fake, a publicity, not social media. And she said, and we had

1213
01:10:24,575 --> 01:10:28,375
Speaker 4:  the file and nothing about the file indicates that it's fake. Okay. Like

1214
01:10:29,155 --> 01:10:32,655
Speaker 4:  we were, Tom was sent the uncompressed un

1215
01:10:33,255 --> 01:10:37,055
Speaker 4:  seemingly unaltered original photo off the iPhone. And we were

1216
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,615
Speaker 4:  looking at it, we were trying to figure out, we were like gone to ask Apple

1217
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:43,825
Speaker 4:  because it is very odd Yeah. That she's making three

1218
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:46,225
Speaker 4:  different poses in the mirrors. And so everyone's trying to like figure this

1219
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:50,175
Speaker 4:  out. Again, a lot of people claiming that it's fake. It turns

1220
01:10:50,275 --> 01:10:54,255
Speaker 4:  out someone else had taken the photo and they had the camera

1221
01:10:54,655 --> 01:10:58,535
Speaker 4:  accidentally in Panorama mode. Oh yeah. So it actually did stitch together

1222
01:10:58,535 --> 01:11:02,015
Speaker 4:  several frames across to make it panorama. But if you

1223
01:11:02,335 --> 01:11:05,975
Speaker 4:  don't move the camera enough and You don't get a wide enough picture,

1224
01:11:06,515 --> 01:11:08,975
Speaker 4:  the iPhone does not append the Panorama label. Yeah.

1225
01:11:09,075 --> 01:11:12,855
Speaker 6:  Oh. The only tell, and I, I, I think

1226
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:17,965
Speaker 6:  there's a YouTuber, I Fondo, his name is Farouk. He's the one who kind of

1227
01:11:17,965 --> 01:11:20,765
Speaker 6:  like popularized or, or, or, or told the world about this

1228
01:11:21,355 --> 01:11:25,285
Speaker 6:  reasoning how it worked. But the only tell is that the resolution of the

1229
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:29,045
Speaker 6:  final image is not the same as the resolution that is captured

1230
01:11:29,065 --> 01:11:33,005
Speaker 6:  by the sensor. And so the photos app does not

1231
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:36,845
Speaker 6:  say Panorama because it's not a panoramic view. It's too

1232
01:11:37,955 --> 01:11:41,885
Speaker 6:  tall and narrow. It's a vertically composed shot, but the

1233
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:45,565
Speaker 6:  pixels are different. And so that is like the tell there that is in panoramic

1234
01:11:45,565 --> 01:11:49,485
Speaker 6:  mode. Farouk was able to replicate this very quickly as soon as

1235
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:52,805
Speaker 6:  he figured that out by putting his phone in panoramic mode and like doing

1236
01:11:52,925 --> 01:11:56,725
Speaker 6:  a very, like a, a another shot just that same way and was able to

1237
01:11:56,725 --> 01:11:59,485
Speaker 6:  replicate it in instantly. So it's, it's kind of fascinating. What's really

1238
01:11:59,685 --> 01:12:03,405
Speaker 6:  fascinating to me is like the stitching is like perfect. Which

1239
01:12:03,405 --> 01:12:05,525
Speaker 4:  Is like, because the cam 'cause the camera isn't moving. Yeah. I didn't

1240
01:12:05,525 --> 01:12:08,725
Speaker 5:  Know you could do that. I thought like you, because it always is like, move

1241
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:12,525
Speaker 5:  the camera. That's what my phone sounds like to me. But it's, it's always

1242
01:12:12,525 --> 01:12:14,445
Speaker 5:  telling me to move the camera. So I'm always like, do I

1243
01:12:14,445 --> 01:12:17,325
Speaker 6:  Think it just tells that Alex that tells you how well people follow directions

1244
01:12:17,325 --> 01:12:18,485
Speaker 6:  on their devices when they're just

1245
01:12:18,845 --> 01:12:19,525
Speaker 5:  Mashing button. Can I just ignore that?

1246
01:12:20,185 --> 01:12:21,565
Speaker 6:  You could just ignore it. Yeah.

1247
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:25,165
Speaker 4:  One Apple should just label all Panorama photos as panoramas. Yeah. That

1248
01:12:25,165 --> 01:12:28,485
Speaker 4:  seems like an easy fix to the solution. But two, the

1249
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:32,245
Speaker 4:  expectation that AI is just gonna munge with reality

1250
01:12:32,905 --> 01:12:34,205
Speaker 4:  is everywhere now.

1251
01:12:34,915 --> 01:12:38,885
Speaker 5:  Well, I don't think the expectation is, the reality is like that, that that's

1252
01:12:38,885 --> 01:12:41,805
Speaker 5:  the reality of the situation. But like, I think people are still, because

1253
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:44,165
Speaker 5:  that's why everybody thought it was a fake. 'cause everybody's like, you're

1254
01:12:44,245 --> 01:12:48,125
Speaker 5:  a liar. You did this on purpose, you used Photoshop or, or Panorama or

1255
01:12:48,285 --> 01:12:51,805
Speaker 5:  whatever. And it's like, no, she just accidentally did it. Yeah. Like,

1256
01:12:52,265 --> 01:12:55,645
Speaker 4:  But even if you, even if you think this is the world's greatest publicity

1257
01:12:55,645 --> 01:12:58,765
Speaker 4:  stunt Yeah. Targeted to a very small community, very

1258
01:12:58,765 --> 01:12:59,005
Speaker 5:  Small group.

1259
01:13:00,185 --> 01:13:03,925
Speaker 4:  It relies on an understanding that AI

1260
01:13:04,085 --> 01:13:06,565
Speaker 4:  exists Mm. And is doing photo stuff. Mm.

1261
01:13:06,565 --> 01:13:07,565
Speaker 5:  That's true. That's true.

1262
01:13:07,735 --> 01:13:11,485
Speaker 4:  Right? It's not like it's either ghosts in the building, like No, no. It's

1263
01:13:11,485 --> 01:13:15,365
Speaker 4:  like, oh, the, the iPhone cameras AI took this

1264
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:19,285
Speaker 4:  completely unbelievable picture and it AI generated you. And

1265
01:13:19,285 --> 01:13:22,005
Speaker 4:  like people will believe that that's true. Yeah. And a lot of people believe

1266
01:13:22,005 --> 01:13:24,725
Speaker 4:  that it's true. Such that other people were debunking it like the whole thing.

1267
01:13:25,145 --> 01:13:28,885
Speaker 4:  And in the meantime it was a totally different lane Yeah.

1268
01:13:29,145 --> 01:13:30,725
Speaker 4:  Of photography. Yeah.

1269
01:13:30,845 --> 01:13:34,485
Speaker 5:  'cause because a lot of the theories were around it was doing that thing

1270
01:13:34,485 --> 01:13:37,525
Speaker 5:  where it chooses the best shot of you and it just happened to assume she

1271
01:13:37,525 --> 01:13:39,165
Speaker 5:  was three different people. Right.

1272
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,565
Speaker 4:  It, the mirror had confused sort of like some sort of like best take. Yeah.

1273
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:46,445
Speaker 4:  But Apple smarty share does not work like this at all. And even Google Best

1274
01:13:46,445 --> 01:13:50,165
Speaker 4:  Take does not work like this at all. Apple smarty share stacks seven frames

1275
01:13:50,165 --> 01:13:52,365
Speaker 4:  in like half a second. She would've had to move her hands so fast.

1276
01:13:53,275 --> 01:13:53,565
Speaker 5:  Just

1277
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:58,485
Speaker 4:  Like, like totally insanely too fast. Like that's why I was like, we gotta

1278
01:13:58,485 --> 01:14:02,045
Speaker 4:  get the original file. There's no way that an iPhone just generate this.

1279
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:04,925
Speaker 4:  'cause I was not thinking about Panorama mode. Yeah. So it's a Photoshop.

1280
01:14:04,925 --> 01:14:08,725
Speaker 4:  We, we might have been able to tell, but the thing that got me was she sent

1281
01:14:08,725 --> 01:14:09,965
Speaker 4:  it to Tom right away. Yeah.

1282
01:14:10,465 --> 01:14:10,685
Speaker 5:  Tom

1283
01:14:10,685 --> 01:14:13,525
Speaker 4:  Reached it's weird. Reached out and she was like, here you go. And that,

1284
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:16,805
Speaker 4:  that like, to me like you are a reporter long enough. Like, oh, there's some

1285
01:14:16,805 --> 01:14:20,645
Speaker 4:  things where if there's a hesitation there. Yeah. It's like you

1286
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:22,565
Speaker 4:  only can get a compressed one then you're like, is

1287
01:14:22,565 --> 01:14:22,965
Speaker 5:  This off the

1288
01:14:22,965 --> 01:14:25,365
Speaker 4:  Record? And then you blame WhatsApp. Like there's all this stuff that usually

1289
01:14:25,365 --> 01:14:27,645
Speaker 4:  happens. Yeah. When you request an original and she was just like, here you

1290
01:14:27,645 --> 01:14:30,885
Speaker 4:  go. Okay. So I was like All. right. There's something here that don don't

1291
01:14:30,885 --> 01:14:34,285
Speaker 4:  understand and the, the panorama. What is interesting, the, the thing that's

1292
01:14:34,455 --> 01:14:38,125
Speaker 4:  truly fascinating to me is that the culture is ready to

1293
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:40,925
Speaker 4:  receive AI fakery as an explanation for anything.

1294
01:14:41,735 --> 01:14:42,025
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1295
01:14:42,325 --> 01:14:44,945
Speaker 4:  And like, I'm just telling the, the what is a photo apocalypse is like well

1296
01:14:44,945 --> 01:14:48,385
Speaker 4:  and truly here because you can tell anyone

1297
01:14:48,935 --> 01:14:52,865
Speaker 4:  that a photo has been AI faked and they, the chances of

1298
01:14:52,865 --> 01:14:56,465
Speaker 4:  them believing you are just steadily going up. Yeah. Even if it doesn't turn

1299
01:14:56,465 --> 01:14:56,945
Speaker 4:  out to be the case.

1300
01:14:56,965 --> 01:14:59,505
Speaker 5:  That's one of my, all my photos now are gonna be fakes. You don't know.

1301
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:00,985
Speaker 4:  They already

1302
01:15:01,045 --> 01:15:04,145
Speaker 5:  Are. They already are. I haven't taken a real photo in 20 years. All. right.

1303
01:15:04,145 --> 01:15:07,545
Speaker 4:  I've got a couple other ones just to go through quickly.

1304
01:15:08,165 --> 01:15:12,035
Speaker 4:  One, this is maybe my favorite story of the year. Windows

1305
01:15:12,215 --> 01:15:15,915
Speaker 4:  has an issue that is just renaming printers to HP LaserJet across the board.

1306
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:18,235
Speaker 5:  The only printer you need.

1307
01:15:18,385 --> 01:15:20,275
Speaker 4:  It's a very good, it's just

1308
01:15:20,555 --> 01:15:20,755
Speaker 5:  Advertising.

1309
01:15:20,825 --> 01:15:24,195
Speaker 4:  It's like, will AI kill us all? Or will the HP smart app

1310
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:29,475
Speaker 4:  worm, its away under literally every computer on the planet and like begin

1311
01:15:29,475 --> 01:15:30,755
Speaker 4:  taking out centrifuges

1312
01:15:30,935 --> 01:15:31,835
Speaker 5:  And buying ink

1313
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:36,235
Speaker 4:  And buying ink. Like the problem isn't paperclips, the problem is in cartridges.

1314
01:15:36,975 --> 01:15:40,795
Speaker 4:  So Microsoft says it's looking into it. It's Windows 10 11 printers being

1315
01:15:41,075 --> 01:15:45,035
Speaker 4:  randomly renamed to HP LaserJet. Some issues related to printer

1316
01:15:45,315 --> 01:15:48,035
Speaker 4:  configurations are being observed on Windows devices which have access to

1317
01:15:48,035 --> 01:15:49,795
Speaker 4:  the store. It's just very good.

1318
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:50,635
Speaker 5:  It's so good.

1319
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:55,395
Speaker 4:  Everyone just has the HP smart app. Now your printer isn an HP LaserJet and

1320
01:15:55,395 --> 01:15:56,595
Speaker 4:  that's, you're gonna like it.

1321
01:15:56,705 --> 01:16:00,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We, we do say buy a laser printer, but we usually say

1322
01:16:00,605 --> 01:16:01,565
Speaker 5:  brother, not not

1323
01:16:02,045 --> 01:16:05,605
Speaker 4:  Official statement. Most printers are being named as HP LaserJet M

1324
01:16:05,605 --> 01:16:09,285
Speaker 4:  1 0 1 dash M 1 0 6. The icons might also be changed.

1325
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:09,765
Speaker 4:  It's

1326
01:16:11,385 --> 01:16:12,045
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's so

1327
01:16:12,045 --> 01:16:15,645
Speaker 4:  Good. It's very good. Then just real quickly,

1328
01:16:15,865 --> 01:16:19,845
Speaker 4:  we are gonna cover Epic VGO in much more detail on the Wednesday show. Sean

1329
01:16:19,845 --> 01:16:23,725
Speaker 4:  Hollister will be on the show. He's been in the courtroom, but this

1330
01:16:23,725 --> 01:16:27,645
Speaker 4:  is really important for this case. Google has gotten himself into an

1331
01:16:27,885 --> 01:16:31,685
Speaker 4:  enormous amount of trouble with this judge for deleting records throughout

1332
01:16:31,685 --> 01:16:31,965
Speaker 4:  this case.

1333
01:16:32,025 --> 01:16:33,605
Speaker 5:  Ooh. That's a no-no. Like an

1334
01:16:33,845 --> 01:16:37,525
Speaker 4:  Enormous amount of trouble. The judge is furious. Last Friday, he said he

1335
01:16:37,525 --> 01:16:41,285
Speaker 4:  would investigate Google personally for quote, intentionally and

1336
01:16:41,285 --> 01:16:45,085
Speaker 4:  systematically suppressing evidence. He called it a frontal assault

1337
01:16:45,105 --> 01:16:48,845
Speaker 4:  on the Fair Administration of justice. And he said, I'm gonna get to the

1338
01:16:48,845 --> 01:16:52,525
Speaker 4:  bottom of who is responsible on my own outside this trial. Yo

1339
01:16:53,045 --> 01:16:53,565
Speaker 4:  I, don Dunno what kind of,

1340
01:16:54,645 --> 01:16:57,805
Speaker 5:  I like, I I've been in, I've, I've been in enough companies that are, that

1341
01:16:58,045 --> 01:17:00,805
Speaker 5:  are like getting lawsuits and stuff. When you're told to retain all your

1342
01:17:00,805 --> 01:17:04,765
Speaker 5:  records that you just never think to not, you're just like,

1343
01:17:04,765 --> 01:17:06,565
Speaker 5:  yeah, and, and my mess is gonna be out there.

1344
01:17:06,665 --> 01:17:09,820
Speaker 4:  And Sundar was asking like, can I set this chat to auto delete? They were

1345
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:13,805
Speaker 4:  deleting stuff left and right. They admitted in court that they were

1346
01:17:13,805 --> 01:17:17,485
Speaker 4:  just deleting stuff. At one point the judge called in Google's

1347
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:20,925
Speaker 4:  general counsel and made him answer to why these policies were, he's furious

1348
01:17:20,925 --> 01:17:24,645
Speaker 4:  about this. That's great. I will investigate this on my own outside this

1349
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,805
Speaker 4:  trial. It's a very funny threat. Like, he's gonna get a magnifying glass,

1350
01:17:27,855 --> 01:17:30,925
Speaker 4:  start walking his ropes off. He's he puts on a leather jacket. Yeah.

1351
01:17:31,425 --> 01:17:32,645
Speaker 5:  Little fedora. And he's like,

1352
01:17:32,645 --> 01:17:36,405
Speaker 4:  Let's go. He's like a seventies bad cop. You know, it's gonna

1353
01:17:36,405 --> 01:17:36,685
Speaker 4:  Your

1354
01:17:36,835 --> 01:17:39,005
Speaker 5:  Driving his old ass car. Exactly.

1355
01:17:39,115 --> 01:17:42,765
Speaker 4:  He's like, he's got a muscle. He's got a GTO and a magnifying glass. He's

1356
01:17:42,765 --> 01:17:46,565
Speaker 4:  like, where are the records? don don't know what that will lead to. But

1357
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,725
Speaker 4:  importantly, he has told the jury,

1358
01:17:50,505 --> 01:17:53,845
Speaker 4:  not that they have to, but they may infer

1359
01:17:54,535 --> 01:17:58,285
Speaker 4:  wrongdoing on the part of Google if there's a question that the missing records

1360
01:17:58,285 --> 01:17:59,605
Speaker 4:  would've answered.

1361
01:18:00,035 --> 01:18:00,325
Speaker 5:  Okay.

1362
01:18:00,415 --> 01:18:03,365
Speaker 4:  Right. So he's, and and that's like a pretty loaded suggestion.

1363
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:07,525
Speaker 5:  I was like that. I mean it's like, well that's fair, but also, Ooh, that's

1364
01:18:07,525 --> 01:18:08,165
Speaker 5:  bad for Google.

1365
01:18:08,495 --> 01:18:12,205
Speaker 4:  Right. So the the idea here is that the, the jury is gonna consider, and

1366
01:18:12,205 --> 01:18:15,685
Speaker 4:  it really, it really seems like Google might lose this case.

1367
01:18:15,915 --> 01:18:19,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah. In a way that maybe at the end of Apple, you know, I I still think

1368
01:18:20,035 --> 01:18:23,885
Speaker 4:  Epic walked away with one important, just the way the legal

1369
01:18:23,885 --> 01:18:26,405
Speaker 4:  system works. They want a bunch of stuff and they want to appeal whatever.

1370
01:18:26,545 --> 01:18:29,885
Speaker 4:  But Apple is like, we just run our business and that's it. Google, there's

1371
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:33,525
Speaker 4:  all this evidence and there's much deleted evidence. All this stuff. It

1372
01:18:33,525 --> 01:18:37,405
Speaker 4:  really seems like epic mounted a much stronger case with Google. Yeah. And

1373
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:41,385
Speaker 4:  now the jury is being sent and they are allowed to

1374
01:18:41,595 --> 01:18:45,515
Speaker 4:  infer whatever Google was hiding was bad. Which is a

1375
01:18:45,515 --> 01:18:48,115
Speaker 4:  just a big deal. It might come to nothing. It might not come to nothing.

1376
01:18:48,305 --> 01:18:52,075
Speaker 4:  It's just worth noting the judge is furious. Like this is the

1377
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:55,155
Speaker 4:  shadiest thing Google has done and the judge is furious about it and he has

1378
01:18:55,155 --> 01:18:55,955
Speaker 4:  told the jury about it

1379
01:18:56,095 --> 01:18:58,995
Speaker 5:  And it's gonna make all the, the appeals really messy to I 'cause I just

1380
01:18:58,995 --> 01:19:01,555
Speaker 5:  assumed they will all be appealed. Whatever the decision is.

1381
01:19:01,615 --> 01:19:05,235
Speaker 4:  Oh, whatever the decision is appealed. It, it all just, what you appeal is

1382
01:19:05,235 --> 01:19:06,035
Speaker 4:  the law. Yeah.

1383
01:19:06,185 --> 01:19:06,475
Speaker 5:  Okay.

1384
01:19:06,535 --> 01:19:09,075
Speaker 4:  So the facts remain the facts. And so

1385
01:19:09,505 --> 01:19:12,995
Speaker 5:  Just, and this is why you don't delete your records. Right? Yeah.

1386
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:14,515
Speaker 5:  'cause this will happen.

1387
01:19:14,965 --> 01:19:18,555
Speaker 4:  Right. But the, an appeals court does not to get, to go back and say,

1388
01:19:19,335 --> 01:19:21,395
Speaker 4:  the jury's finding a fact we wrong.

1389
01:19:21,395 --> 01:19:21,995
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Right.

1390
01:19:22,265 --> 01:19:25,155
Speaker 4:  They get to say that the law is wrong and we should change the law or like

1391
01:19:25,155 --> 01:19:28,675
Speaker 4:  this other thing. Okay. So that's, that's a little, it's a little law schooly,

1392
01:19:28,675 --> 01:19:30,035
Speaker 5:  Technical All. right. I see it. I see the text.

1393
01:19:30,615 --> 01:19:34,355
Speaker 4:  But so here the inference of the jury was you might appeal, this was a wrong

1394
01:19:34,355 --> 01:19:38,155
Speaker 4:  inference to give the jury or whatever, but he didn't, he didn't

1395
01:19:38,395 --> 01:19:40,635
Speaker 4:  instruct them to think one way or another. He said they were just allowed

1396
01:19:40,635 --> 01:19:44,275
Speaker 4:  to, which is a very important instruction. Anyway. I would just say the Epic

1397
01:19:44,755 --> 01:19:48,275
Speaker 4:  v Google case, we're gonna talk about much more with Sean on Wednesday.

1398
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:51,315
Speaker 4:  Get into it. But that was the one that stuck out to me this week is like,

1399
01:19:51,315 --> 01:19:54,355
Speaker 4:  oh, there's something there. All. right. And then the last one I just wanna

1400
01:19:54,355 --> 01:19:58,275
Speaker 4:  call out Alison Johnson, second call for her today has a

1401
01:19:58,275 --> 01:20:01,875
Speaker 4:  big piece as part of our infrastructure package about just 5G

1402
01:20:02,855 --> 01:20:06,235
Speaker 4:  and the fact that it hasn't paid off for anyone.

1403
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:11,045
Speaker 4:  And she, she basically listened to all the big carriers earnings calls

1404
01:20:11,305 --> 01:20:14,125
Speaker 4:  and talk and how they're talking about their investments, what the investors

1405
01:20:14,395 --> 01:20:18,285
Speaker 4:  want. There's nothing there. Like, it's basically like they

1406
01:20:18,285 --> 01:20:21,885
Speaker 4:  might compete with fixed broadband. So you, instead of having

1407
01:20:22,405 --> 01:20:26,325
Speaker 4:  whatever ISP you have, you might get a 5G fixed wireless device. They

1408
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:30,005
Speaker 4:  seem excited about that. They're excited about enterprise customers buying

1409
01:20:30,135 --> 01:20:34,005
Speaker 4:  fixed 5G networks, which is hard 'cause you gotta have an enterprise

1410
01:20:34,005 --> 01:20:37,645
Speaker 4:  sales team, which many of them don't. And then they can do what Verizon is

1411
01:20:37,645 --> 01:20:39,525
Speaker 4:  calling pricing actions. Hmm.

1412
01:20:40,055 --> 01:20:40,405
Speaker 5:  Which

1413
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:44,285
Speaker 4:  Means one thing, I hate it. The action is turning the price

1414
01:20:44,345 --> 01:20:47,165
Speaker 4:  up. That's the action you can take.

1415
01:20:47,745 --> 01:20:51,645
Speaker 5:  You know what we can do? You got faster internet now you pay a hundred dollars

1416
01:20:51,715 --> 01:20:52,685
Speaker 5:  more. Enjoy.

1417
01:20:53,405 --> 01:20:56,285
Speaker 4:  I will remind everyone, we actually got a note this week about Project Jenna

1418
01:20:56,495 --> 01:21:00,405
Speaker 4:  Fivey, the ill faded attempt to turn Dish Network into a mobile

1419
01:21:00,405 --> 01:21:01,285
Speaker 4:  carrier. Still

1420
01:21:01,285 --> 01:21:02,005
Speaker 5:  Technically a,

1421
01:21:02,755 --> 01:21:06,645
Speaker 4:  They they have it. They've, I believe Allison points this

1422
01:21:06,645 --> 01:21:10,405
Speaker 4:  out. They've technically hit their coverage goals, but they've done it by

1423
01:21:10,525 --> 01:21:13,565
Speaker 4:  leasing space on at and t and T-Mobile's network. So they have not actually

1424
01:21:13,565 --> 01:21:16,605
Speaker 4:  built a nationwide wireless network.

1425
01:21:17,445 --> 01:21:18,215
Speaker 5:  It's just Mitchell.

1426
01:21:18,725 --> 01:21:21,375
Speaker 4:  It's just Mitchell. He's out there on the trail.

1427
01:21:22,635 --> 01:21:26,495
Speaker 4:  Our own wonderful Mitchell Clark, who we tried desperately to use Project

1428
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:30,455
Speaker 4:  Gen five sis. We, this whole thing was a boondoggle. Yeah. It

1429
01:21:30,455 --> 01:21:33,455
Speaker 4:  cost a lot of money. It put all these carriers in debt. It consolidated us

1430
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:36,855
Speaker 4:  down from four to three, well, three and project Gen five sis.

1431
01:21:37,875 --> 01:21:40,735
Speaker 4:  And now we're doing pricing actions. Like we should just see it for what

1432
01:21:40,735 --> 01:21:43,935
Speaker 4:  it is. You can read Allison's piece link to it. It is great. It is very

1433
01:21:44,425 --> 01:21:48,375
Speaker 4:  clear-eyed and direct about what has happened in a way that is not

1434
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:50,815
Speaker 4:  just me ranting and raving and like makes the argument really well. It's
