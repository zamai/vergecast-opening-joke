Description: In part 1 of our Vergecast: Future of Music series, Alex Cranz talks with Switched on Pop's Charlie Harding about the trends in music today that make new songs out of old material, and whether it's foreshadowing the future of pop.

2
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:35,840
Speaker 2:  Welcome

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,480
Speaker 3:  To the Vergecast the flagship podcast of the cassettes that you lost underneath

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,680
Speaker 3:  the seat of your first car. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and this is the

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,640
Speaker 3:  beginning of a new series. So for the next three Mondays, we're

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,120
Speaker 3:  gonna be bringing you different stories about the future of music. It's kind

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,080
Speaker 3:  of exactly what it sounds like. We're gonna try to figure out what the future

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,600
Speaker 3:  of music is, but we have a bunch of different ideas about what that might

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,360
Speaker 3:  look like. Our first episode this week comes from the verges managing editor,

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,720
Speaker 3:  Alex Krantz. Hi Alex.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,000
Speaker 4:  Hello, David.

12
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,760
Speaker 3:  What is this episode about? I realize, I know almost nothing about what this

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,880
Speaker 3:  episode is about. You just like disappeared and made podcast.

14
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,840
Speaker 4:  It's it's about the future of music.

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,240
Speaker 3:  Oh, okay. Good. That's perfect.

16
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,080
Speaker 4:  We were looking into like, what about old music what's happening with old

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,800
Speaker 4:  music? Cuz it felt like we were seeing a lot of like remixes and samples

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,040
Speaker 4:  and interpolations and stuff. And as we thought about it more, we were like,

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,960
Speaker 4:  wait a minute, this seems like the future of music might be more related

20
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,640
Speaker 4:  to like the back catalog of music, all the old stuff.

21
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,760
Speaker 3:  I mean, it is kind of true. You listen to music now and it's like every part

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,680
Speaker 3:  of songs now is actually like the drum line from a song from the

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,440
Speaker 3:  1950s.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,880
Speaker 4:  Yes. So we wanted to figure out, is this like just a thing?

25
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,840
Speaker 4:  Is this just randomly happening? What's going on here? Is this on purpose?

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,000
Speaker 4:  Our music executive saying, yes, I need more of this song from the

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,120
Speaker 4:  1950s as a baseline in this little NAS song.

28
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,600
Speaker 4:  So that's what we did. We went and we spoke with Charlie Harding, who

29
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,440
Speaker 4:  is a music journalist. He's a songwriter. And he also

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,840
Speaker 4:  co-host the podcast switched on pop.

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,320
Speaker 3:  One of my favorite podcasts.

32
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,320
Speaker 4:  It's so good. So he felt like the perfect person to talk to about this. And

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,040
Speaker 4:  it was a lot of

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,240
Speaker 3:  Fun. Awesome. All right, take it away. Let's go.

35
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,400
Speaker 4:  Okay. So I have Charlie here. Charlie, you are like a music expert,

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,960
Speaker 4:  especially compared to me, but I think probably compared to most people,

37
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,960
Speaker 4:  is that accurate? Can I say that about you?

38
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,840
Speaker 5:  I report on music. So yeah.

39
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I feel like that's fine. Music

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,240
Speaker 5:  Is an infinitely large vocabulary with many

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,840
Speaker 5:  languages that one must learn. And so I know a few of them,

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,360
Speaker 4:  You know, pop music though.

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
Speaker 5:  I know pop music pretty well.

44
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,720
Speaker 4:  Okay. So we're gonna talk about a couple of different trends that are happening

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,520
Speaker 4:  here in music. And I'm curious about whether this is an indication of the

46
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,400
Speaker 4:  future of music. Great. So the first one I wanna talk about was this article

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,320
Speaker 4:  I read on vulture Sina. Nia will sound older on her

48
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,280
Speaker 4:  new Postmus album. Hmm. So Selena died in 1995

49
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,240
Speaker 4:  and they're using recordings from when she was like 13 to 16

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,120
Speaker 4:  years old. And they're, detuning her voice to

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,960
Speaker 4:  make her quote sound like she stepped out of the booth at 23

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,360
Speaker 4:  years old.

53
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,040
Speaker 5:  This is a obviously very particular and tragic case of

54
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,800
Speaker 5:  the need to revive a voice. But people have been

55
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,720
Speaker 5:  manipulating vocals since the beginning of recorded

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,200
Speaker 5:  music. And I think it's important to contextualize vocal

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,120
Speaker 5:  manipulation and changes as a very age old

58
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,960
Speaker 5:  thing. If you even think about the era of the crooners Sinatra, if you

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,400
Speaker 5:  will. I did it

60
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,160
Speaker 5:  a big part of their technological advancement was

61
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,600
Speaker 5:  microphone technique. It was getting up real close on the microphone and

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,240
Speaker 5:  getting that deep base. When behind you, you have the

63
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,080
Speaker 5:  support of an orchestra. Now that's an auditory illusion. It's

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,920
Speaker 5:  impossible to sing to an entire arena of people with an

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,480
Speaker 5:  orchestra and you're singing. If you didn't have a microphone, you'd have

66
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,960
Speaker 5:  to be belting to be heard. And so that's just an early example of how people

67
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,840
Speaker 5:  sang even Billy holiday, that sort of whiny vocal that you know,

68
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:26,880
Speaker 9:  And

69
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,360
Speaker 5:  A lot of the reason why she had this very constrained vocal sound

70
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,480
Speaker 5:  that is now iconic, was that she needed to make sure to

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,400
Speaker 5:  not make the needle jump as it was recording. If

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,760
Speaker 5:  there were too many fluctuations in the voice, the needle could skip and

73
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,160
Speaker 5:  ruin the recording. And so part of the vocal technique is actually determined

74
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,960
Speaker 5:  by the technological requirements of Billy holidays era

75
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,640
Speaker 5:  in contemporary pop music, vocal manipulation is

76
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,280
Speaker 5:  very common place. Now every major pop star

77
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,240
Speaker 5:  minus one or two uses some amount of vocal tuning

78
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,040
Speaker 5:  to clean up sometimes just, you know, a small error. Sometimes there's auto

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,520
Speaker 5:  tune through an entire vocal performance. That's extremely common.

80
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,480
Speaker 5:  And for creative effect, I think about Miley Cyrus, we can't stop

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,320
Speaker 5:  where you hear this really low manipulated vocal that was

82
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Speaker 5:  taken from the world of chopped screwed music

83
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,680
Speaker 5:  or Billy Isle's bad guy has this low vocal where

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,080
Speaker 5:  it's like, I'm the bad guy. I'm

85
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,680
Speaker 12:  The bad guy.

86
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,000
Speaker 5:  Even Kanye West's entire early catalog of chipmunks. Soul music

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,240
Speaker 5:  is predicated on taking samples and pitching them way up. So they sound like

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,920
Speaker 5:  they're in a different world.

89
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,080
Speaker 5:  You know what I'm saying? When a doctor told me now what you're talking about

90
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,280
Speaker 5:  here is potentially a little bit different, right? Because it's about trying

91
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,400
Speaker 5:  to perfect the voice change the age,

92
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,600
Speaker 5:  certainly I've done this. It's not that hard. I've taken my

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Speaker 5:  three year old's voice and recorded it and then put it through vocal

94
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,840
Speaker 5:  processing to get a sense of like, what might he sound like when he's 12

95
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,480
Speaker 5:  years old, all you have to do is just change the pitch and a setting called

96
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,160
Speaker 5:  format, which is kind of like how, where you place the vowels in your

97
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,960
Speaker 5:  voice that can make an old voice sound young or a young voice sound

98
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,800
Speaker 5:  old. It can change the perceptions of gender and the ways that gender is

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,080
Speaker 5:  stereotypically perceived in the voice. These things are all actually fairly

100
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,160
Speaker 5:  easy to manipulate. And so I'm not surprised that this is a, a way that

101
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,040
Speaker 5:  flees a state may want to update her music. It's a very

102
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,520
Speaker 5:  achievable thing to do. People look to change,

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,080
Speaker 5:  clean up, update voices all the time.

104
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,120
Speaker 4:  Is it kind of like, I think we've seen maybe with Nirvana and some of these

105
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,920
Speaker 4:  older bands, they go and they find like, oh yeah, they did these garage session

106
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,520
Speaker 4:  recordings. And now we're gonna clean 'em up and make 'em sound a little

107
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,160
Speaker 4:  more studio. Is it kind of that same thing, just finding these old,

108
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,840
Speaker 4:  almost lost tracks and just updating them.

109
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,160
Speaker 5:  They're connected. They're slightly different processes. Like when you're

110
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,600
Speaker 5:  trying to clean up bad recordings, a lot of what needs to be done is

111
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,480
Speaker 5:  removing hiss and crackle and trying to

112
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,160
Speaker 5:  separate the instruments in a way where you can actually really mix them

113
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,200
Speaker 5:  with modern mixing techniques. But part of that will certainly

114
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,840
Speaker 5:  be, Hey, this vocal wasn't recorded very well. How can we get the most out

115
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,640
Speaker 5:  of it and using techniques of cleaning tools and plugins that

116
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,400
Speaker 5:  will nicely EQ and compress and do all kinds of things to the voice, to make

117
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,680
Speaker 5:  it the best sounding performance possible. It's very common. The reality

118
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,480
Speaker 5:  though, is that technology has come a long way at recovering bad

119
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,360
Speaker 5:  audio, but every mix engineer is gonna tell you don't fix it in the mix.

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,680
Speaker 5:  Get it good the first time, you know, this as someone who makes a podcast,

121
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,840
Speaker 5:  if someone delivers you bad audio, it takes 10 times as long to deal with

122
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,080
Speaker 5:  their audio. So a lot can be done. Yeah. But it's, it's very hard work.

123
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,240
Speaker 4:  Have we heard of other artists doing the detuning method? Like in

124
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Speaker 4:  Salina's case?

125
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,920
Speaker 5:  I think this is a somewhat unique case. I'm sure there could be other examples

126
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,800
Speaker 5:  out there. But part of what we're talking about

127
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,000
Speaker 5:  is the uncanny valley of relating to the human

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Speaker 5:  voice. You know, humans are immensely tuned into

129
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,640
Speaker 5:  the voice. In fact, our ears are EQD to hear the human voice over. Other

130
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,120
Speaker 5:  sounds makes sense because we wanna be aware of when our parents call for

131
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,040
Speaker 5:  us when there's danger. Yeah. And so we are very good at hearing

132
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,880
Speaker 5:  when voices don't sound right. It's why some people don't like the sound

133
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,520
Speaker 5:  of auto tune. Cause it doesn't sound natural. I think that when you're

134
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,320
Speaker 5:  updating a vocal, getting an old recording that is recorded

135
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,960
Speaker 5:  poorly at a different age to sound contemporary and totally

136
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,640
Speaker 5:  natural is very challenging. Even if it's done

137
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Speaker 5:  properly, could create fan

138
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
Speaker 5:  confusion. I think especially for a living artist, if

139
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,400
Speaker 5:  they were to release a recording of their younger self, I think it would

140
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,040
Speaker 5:  be more likely that they would actually just make it sound like they're younger

141
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,920
Speaker 5:  self and mix it so that maybe it's a little more in tune. It fits

142
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,720
Speaker 5:  in the mix. Well, but you're talking about not just technology, but

143
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,640
Speaker 5:  also aesthetics and people's expectations and culture. There's

144
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,200
Speaker 5:  a lot of reasons why people might not want to hear that recording. You

145
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,320
Speaker 4:  Talked about that confusion. And I was thinking a lot about like Michael Jackson,

146
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,440
Speaker 4:  after he passed away, Sony music released this whole new like album.

147
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,560
Speaker 4:  And there were a couple of songs on it that people were like, this isn't

148
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,600
Speaker 4:  Michael, this doesn't sound like him. I think this is an impersonator,

149
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,720
Speaker 13:  Everybody piece of Michael Jackson,

150
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,920
Speaker 13:  every in the, of Michael Jackson,

151
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,920
Speaker 4:  One fan actually in 2014 sued Sony music

152
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,520
Speaker 4:  because she was like, it's not him. So Sony actually had to pull the songs

153
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,760
Speaker 4:  from streaming services this year to avoid further controversy.

154
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,640
Speaker 5:  Pop music is deeply predicated on a performance of

155
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,120
Speaker 5:  authenticity. People want to believe that the

156
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,880
Speaker 5:  performer is performing their identity in their life. And that a

157
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,560
Speaker 5:  listener can have this parasocial relationship with that person and potentially

158
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,000
Speaker 5:  see their own life in that music. And for that

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,760
Speaker 5:  performance of authenticity to work, you have to believe in the

160
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,440
Speaker 5:  thing. And so in any place where someone is

161
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,640
Speaker 5:  using impersonators and ghost writers, fans frequently become

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,320
Speaker 5:  very suspect of those kind of techniques. Fans have long

163
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,400
Speaker 5:  critiqued, the idea of boardrooms participating in the

164
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,360
Speaker 5:  songwriting process, things being overly commercial. There's a lot

165
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,520
Speaker 5:  of reasons why I think we should challenge some of those assumptions. Yeah.

166
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,000
Speaker 5:  Because it's their age old. There is reason to believe that fans should be

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,440
Speaker 5:  suspect of how is technology potentially

168
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,240
Speaker 5:  manipulating my relationship to that artist that I love

169
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,160
Speaker 5:  technology or potential fake recreations. Like

170
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,400
Speaker 5:  if you're gonna recreate a song that I love or release a new

171
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,040
Speaker 5:  song from someone who has died, like either be like, Hey,

172
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,760
Speaker 5:  we're getting someone else. Who's awesome. Who you really love to perform

173
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,600
Speaker 5:  in the style of that person and be very clear about it or give me an

174
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,240
Speaker 5:  old recording that is mixed in a strange way. One of the

175
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,120
Speaker 5:  earliest examples of what you're talking about in fact that I can recall

176
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,600
Speaker 5:  was the Beatles. When they put out their anthologies

177
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,120
Speaker 5:  found songs that John Lennon had

178
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,280
Speaker 5:  recorded and the three remaining surviving members of

179
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Speaker 5:  the band at that time put out the song real love

180
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,480
Speaker 5:  and free as a bird.

181
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,800
Speaker 5:  And those were kind of like the Beatles final two recordings

182
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,720
Speaker 5:  of the four of them by taking tape of John Lennon that had been left on the

183
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,560
Speaker 5:  floor, writing new verses for Paul to

184
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,440
Speaker 5:  sing in between and sound like they're a band again. And

185
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,040
Speaker 5:  that works because that I think passes the authenticity test

186
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,280
Speaker 4:  Is the intent part of that, that like the intent of the artist is

187
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,040
Speaker 4:  part of that, that desire from fans,

188
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,760
Speaker 5:  The artist's intent is always something that people are questioning

189
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,040
Speaker 5:  about is an estate managing the artist in a

190
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,640
Speaker 5:  way that they intended a great example would be the prince

191
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,320
Speaker 5:  estate. You know, prince was suspect of streaming and limited

192
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,000
Speaker 5:  the amount that his songs were available on streaming services, but

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Speaker 5:  his estate has made his music available on Spotify. And so

194
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,280
Speaker 5:  there is reasons why fans might want to question whether or not that is a

195
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,120
Speaker 5:  thing that he would have done and may want to participate

196
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,000
Speaker 5:  in his music in a way that would be closer to his intent. It

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,200
Speaker 5:  is always a part of the conversation

198
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,440
Speaker 4:  Also adjacent to this is AI voices. Like we

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,240
Speaker 4:  see that happen a lot in films and stuff like that, where they'll

200
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,080
Speaker 4:  recreate the voices is that happening in music where people are like,

201
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,840
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna recreate Judy Garland. Like, are they doing that

202
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,440
Speaker 4:  recreating these? And is that like a viable future

203
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,280
Speaker 4:  for music?

204
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,520
Speaker 5:  This is happening. It is a fairly

205
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,880
Speaker 5:  nascent area of AI research. I'm sure people have been working at for a

206
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,000
Speaker 5:  couple of years, but I don't know of at this point

207
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,880
Speaker 5:  publicly available tools where you can like

208
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,720
Speaker 5:  manipulate someone else's old vocal. But I know that there are firms

209
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,480
Speaker 5:  that are doing this, that are successfully recreating voices

210
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,320
Speaker 5:  off of training sets of that singer. That sound

211
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,280
Speaker 5:  reasonable at this point and could be used for future recordings. And

212
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,840
Speaker 5:  there are reasons why people may want to use those AI recordings.

213
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,320
Speaker 5:  A great example might be, Hey, you finished a track and you're a really busy

214
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,720
Speaker 5:  pop star and all of a sudden you're not available, but you missed one backing

215
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,680
Speaker 5:  note. And we want to recreate that backing note. There's a bunch of different

216
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,000
Speaker 5:  ways you could do that today, but why don't you just like, eh, we'll just

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,920
Speaker 5:  have the AI sing it for you. I could see lots of applications, why people

218
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,840
Speaker 5:  might use these tools in the future, but

219
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,040
Speaker 4:  Using more as tools, not necessarily as like the centerpiece of an album.

220
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,480
Speaker 5:  No, of course not. And yes, someone's going to do it because

221
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,800
Speaker 5:  first of all, someone's gonna do it as an art project because it's interesting

222
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,640
Speaker 5:  art people love making AI. Art is like the conversation that is happening

223
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,600
Speaker 5:  right now. So someone's gonna make the full AI vocal album at some point

224
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,320
Speaker 5:  in which nobody's saying it, and nobody wrote the lyrics like that's gonna

225
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,080
Speaker 5:  happen for sure. There's a lot of precedent for bands continuing

226
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,080
Speaker 5:  on past the, we'll just say availability of their

227
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,680
Speaker 5:  lead singer, whether they've left the group, whether they're deceased, I

228
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,200
Speaker 5:  can think of like queen van Halen Genesis, the grateful dead

229
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,000
Speaker 5:  Nirvana Zappa. They have all continued to

230
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,720
Speaker 5:  perform with other lead singers. Maybe

231
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,640
Speaker 5:  Frank Zappa is one of the really interesting cases. His son dwindles has

232
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,440
Speaker 5:  a project where he performs his father's music Zappa without Zappa. There

233
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,400
Speaker 5:  are cases where fandoms want to continue to engage in the

234
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,280
Speaker 5:  artwork and the music of their favorite bands. And as long as that fandom

235
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,160
Speaker 5:  is around, there's probably a marketplace for this kind of

236
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,480
Speaker 5:  recreation of a voice, but it's gonna have to pass

237
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,440
Speaker 5:  through the lens of culture through these authenticity tests. Do people want

238
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,720
Speaker 5:  to hear this? And so will it be used? Absolutely.

239
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,800
Speaker 5:  How it's gonna be used, I think is gonna be determined by where is the culture

240
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,520
Speaker 5:  at and are we willing and wanting to hear new, especially new

241
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,640
Speaker 5:  material with old voices? We'll see. I think we might definitely hear maybe

242
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,160
Speaker 5:  like remixes and updated lyrics and things that are like

243
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,240
Speaker 5:  mashups and kind of more in the EDM

244
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,720
Speaker 5:  hip hop remix culture. That feels like a very ripe place

245
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,080
Speaker 5:  for AI voices from deceased artists.

246
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,920
Speaker 4:  Well, it's funny you bring up remixes because we are actually gonna talk

247
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,800
Speaker 4:  about that, but first we're gonna take it to a break

248
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,560
Speaker 2:  Fox creative.

251
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,080
Speaker 14:  once you kind of understand what that sounds like, the confidence

252
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,920
Speaker 14:  brushes in I'm Alda August, I

253
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,560
Speaker 14:  go by CHNG the nomad on stage. And I am a DJ producer from Seattle,

254
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,080
Speaker 14:  Washington,

255
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,240
Speaker 1:  Alda captures inspiration wherever. And whenever it strikes

256
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Speaker 1:  using a familiar tool, voice memos on her phone,

257
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,160
Speaker 14:  I'll be in the car and I'll embarrass myself in front of my partner and

258
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,280
Speaker 14:  be like, I, I got a really quick

259
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,560
Speaker 1:  On her song, go away. All that took frustration and rage and turn it into

260
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,200
Speaker 1:  something empowering and cathartic.

261
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,920
Speaker 14:  I was at my line cook job, and

262
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,680
Speaker 14:  another big artist was outed as an abuser.

263
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,120
Speaker 14:  And I was just so sick of hearing all these men

264
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,480
Speaker 14:  in power abusing and manipulating women. I

265
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,360
Speaker 14:  came up with the hook right then and there and sing it to myself

266
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,160
Speaker 14:  in the freezer,

267
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,080
Speaker 2:  Get the outta here. You got five

268
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,120
Speaker 14:  Seconds for drag,

269
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,400
Speaker 14:  whenever I'm at work or playing golf or just spacing out.

270
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,480
Speaker 14:  I find inspiration everywhere. And I never really know when it's going to

271
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,200
Speaker 14:  strike. So I just try to stay open to whatever the next sound or

272
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,280

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,880
Speaker 4:  Okay. And we're back during the break. Charlie was telling me he has a very

277
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,240
Speaker 4:  cool AI remix story. You wanna share.

278
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,200
Speaker 5:  One of the biggest challenges in remixing music is do you

279
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,840
Speaker 5:  actually have the original music available? There was a famous fire that

280
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,760
Speaker 5:  burned down a ton of masters in the world of popular music.

281
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,080
Speaker 5:  One band included was the band green day

282
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,080
Speaker 15:  In my bedroom, staring at the,

283
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,520
Speaker 5:  They lost their masters. And so they, they

284
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,280
Speaker 5:  wanted to do remixes, mash up their music in new and original ways, but they

285
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,600
Speaker 5:  only have the finished final products. You can't change the voice. You can't

286
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,320
Speaker 5:  take the guitars out until they partnered up with an AI company

287
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,840
Speaker 5:  called audio shake, who can do AI

288
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
Speaker 5:  stemming, where they can actually use AI to remove

289
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,480
Speaker 5:  and separate the guitars, the base of the drums, the vocals background instruments,

290
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,640
Speaker 5:  and create them as separate tracks so that you can do new things with them.

291
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,840
Speaker 5:  And green day did that and release one of their songs

292
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,720
Speaker 5:  on TikTok, where they actually just completely removed the guitar so

293
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,640
Speaker 5:  that other people could play guitar. Along with it,

294
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,960
Speaker 15:  Stand alone in my bedroom, staring at the

295
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,280
Speaker 15:  walls,

296
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,440
Speaker 5:  Any sort of guitar hero, mash up competition

297
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,360
Speaker 5:  of your dreams if you're a fan. And so I think that you're gonna see

298
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,960
Speaker 5:  AI tools using you use for all kinds of creative purposes for fan

299
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,440
Speaker 5:  engagement and for putting music

300
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,560
Speaker 5:  in new contexts that you couldn't do in any other way.

301
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,400
Speaker 4:  And I think that like those remixes seem to be one of those things that's

302
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,040
Speaker 4:  really taking off. I know TikTok, we talk a lot about on the Vergecast TikTok

303
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,720
Speaker 4:  is kind of this big engine for, for music right now. It's it's driving

304
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,440
Speaker 4:  music in a way maybe more so than Spotify even. Is that

305
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,400
Speaker 4:  just like a fad, is that, you know, because everybody's

306
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,240
Speaker 4:  got TikTok and the fancy new tools, or is this just like kind of

307
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,960
Speaker 4:  a new future, we're just gonna be getting more and more remixes

308
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,000
Speaker 5:  Remix of culture. And especially the use of interpolations is at an all

309
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Speaker 5:  time high. We're seeing more new music mashed up with older

310
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,560
Speaker 5:  music than we have in the last decade. I've done some reporting that shows

311
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,160
Speaker 5:  that inter interpolations have in fact doubled in the last five years on

312
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,960
Speaker 5:  Billboard's year end hot, 100. You asked me, is this here to stay?

313
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,360
Speaker 5:  I think all of culture is a fad, right? Like at

314
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,320
Speaker 5:  some point we're all gonna be wearing moon boots again, I'm

315
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:48,720
Speaker 4:  So excited.

316
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,840
Speaker 5:  And so at some point, remixes are not gonna be cool, but

317
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,880
Speaker 5:  is this here for a minute, for sure, because TikTok is the biggest,

318
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,760
Speaker 5:  most important social network at the moment. And it's gonna have staying

319
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,520
Speaker 5:  power for how long. I don't know the cycles of power and

320
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,840
Speaker 5:  staying power within social media seem to be

321
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,800
Speaker 5:  increasing in time. And so I think it's gonna be around for

322
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,560
Speaker 5:  a minute. I just, if you ask me what's happening in 50 years, I don't know.

323
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,080
Speaker 5:  I, like I said, I'm gonna be wearing moon boots on the moon and you

324
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,400
Speaker 4:  Be looking

325
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,520
Speaker 5:  Great making music in ways. I can't even imagine. Thank you. Well,

326
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,000
Speaker 4:  You talk about in inter interpolations, how is that different than

327
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,440
Speaker 4:  remixes? Like how, how do we define those two?

328
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,760
Speaker 5:  Sure. If you want to use someone else's song,

329
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,640
Speaker 5:  there are roughly three things that you can do. One is you can make

330
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,440
Speaker 5:  a cover of a song, which is basically, you know, redoing all

331
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,360
Speaker 5:  of the melody and the lyrics with maybe slight variation, but staying

332
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,640
Speaker 5:  really close to the original. You could sample a song where you actually

333
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Speaker 5:  take the original recording and you put it into a new song and you

334
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,720
Speaker 5:  change the context. So you're not singing the same lyrics throughout the

335
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,120
Speaker 5:  entire thing, but you're using the actual recording itself. The last thing

336
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,720
Speaker 5:  you can do is you can interpolate a song, which is that you're going to borrow

337
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,640
Speaker 5:  a musical element from another song. It could be a melody, it could be a

338
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,200
Speaker 5:  lyric. It could be a big part of the vibe in production,

339
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,520
Speaker 5:  and you're going to update it into a new song. And so

340
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,800
Speaker 5:  this has become extremely popular. Recently,

341
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,760
Speaker 5:  young gravy has a song called Betty, get money, never

342
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,800
Speaker 16:  Took a, never take a damn.

343
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,800
Speaker 16:  All I know is chase this

344
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,960
Speaker 5:  Though, which interpolate Rick Asley is never gonna give it up.

345
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,400
Speaker 11:  Gonna give you, gonna let you,

346
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,080
Speaker 5:  Which is great. Cuz if you play that, then I've just Rick rolled all of your

347
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,800
Speaker 5:  listeners. Yes Lato is a great example. Her song,

348
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,680
Speaker 5:  big energy. One of the most fun song last couple years uses both

349
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,000
Speaker 5:  a sample of the Tom Tom club

350
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,120
Speaker 5:  and interpolate Mariah Carrie's fantasy,

351
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,160
Speaker 5:  which had used the same sample, but because Lato uses

352
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,920
Speaker 5:  some of Mariah Carey's lyric she's I interpolating Mariah

353
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,680
Speaker 5:  Carey's version of the Tom Tom club.

354
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,040
Speaker 17:  Hey beach. I could be a fantasy. I could tell you got the

355
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,520
Speaker 17:  energy.

356
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,760
Speaker 5:  That's a very popular interpolation. There's a new interpolation of the song.

357
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,120
Speaker 5:  Blue ABA Diba that David GTA has out

358
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,400
Speaker 5:  there is even a song by Rita aura, which interpolate

359
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,240
Speaker 5:  the Beverly Hills cop theme.

360
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,000
Speaker 11:  It's

361
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,800
Speaker 5:  A very common thing right now that people are taking old

362
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,680
Speaker 5:  hits that are still in the cultural memory. Still interesting, but maybe

363
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,320
Speaker 5:  have faded just a little bit and then updating them and bringing them back

364
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,200
Speaker 5:  because frankly there's no better hook than a song that's

365
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,120
Speaker 5:  already hooked you before. So people like to update them. It's kinda like

366
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,080
Speaker 5:  the Hollywood strategy of rebooting everything. And it all has to do with

367
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,400
Speaker 5:  the cost of marketing marketing. A new film is extremely expensive. People

368
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,880
Speaker 5:  wanna go see things that are familiar and it's easier to market

369
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,920
Speaker 5:  something that is already in the popular consciousness. And so I

370
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,800
Speaker 5:  think the same thing is true of music. There is more competition in music

371
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,920
Speaker 5:  today than there ever has been before. The number of songs released daily

372
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,040
Speaker 5:  a few years ago was 60,000 songs on Spotify. And so I don't even know what

373
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,840
Speaker 5:  the number is updated to today, but you have so much competition when you're

374
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,160
Speaker 5:  putting a song out. So maybe if it connects to another major, hit it, you

375
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,960
Speaker 5:  have a better chance of being remembered.

376
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,160
Speaker 4:  Are the studios doing this intentionally? Is this just the

377
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,440
Speaker 4:  artist being like, I want people to listen to my song, which I totally get.

378
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,280
Speaker 4:  Where is the, the, the kind of drive coming from to do this?

379
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,200
Speaker 5:  I think it's bidirectional clearly listeners like

380
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,040
Speaker 5:  this music because it's performing very well on billboard. People are choosing

381
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,960
Speaker 5:  to go and listen to it. Radio DJs are continuing to play this music cuz

382
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,840
Speaker 5:  it's working at the same time. Music, publishers, music publishers are the

383
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,480
Speaker 5:  people that own the songwriting credit, which is the part that gets interpolated.

384
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,440
Speaker 5:  Music publishers are actively pitching the idea of

385
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,320
Speaker 5:  I interpolations to major artists to continue the

386
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,480
Speaker 5:  lifetime value of their catalog of music.

387
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,880
Speaker 5:  So I spoke recently with hypnosis sounds and primary wave,

388
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,200
Speaker 5:  two of the biggest financially backed music publishers. These are the people

389
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,040
Speaker 5:  who are buying up old catalogs, like paying

390
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,880
Speaker 5:  sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars for old catalogs. They believe

391
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,680
Speaker 5:  that it's a stable financial asset because they can predict streaming revenue

392
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,040
Speaker 5:  off of these songs for a number of years. And they think that they're gonna

393
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,720
Speaker 5:  make money back off of it. And they're also trying to find new

394
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,240
Speaker 5:  markets and new life for that music. They're doing it through

395
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,240
Speaker 5:  biopics, they're doing it through docs. They're getting people to cover those

396
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,760
Speaker 5:  songs, all which increase the value of that catalog, but they're also

397
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,080
Speaker 5:  actively pitching interpolations. They, they literally go through their list

398
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,720
Speaker 5:  of songs, make lists sometimes even produce ideas for songs

399
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,240
Speaker 5:  that then turn into hits that get played on the radio because

400
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,440
Speaker 5:  through the label system, they're able to pitch those ideas. They get them

401
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,120
Speaker 5:  to a major artist and they get remade. One of my favorite examples of this

402
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,960
Speaker 5:  kind of a thing happening was the song higher love, not

403
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,840
Speaker 5:  talking about Steve Winwood. I'm talking about Kigo taking

404
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,000
Speaker 5:  a bonus track from Whitney Houston, covering that

405
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,040
Speaker 5:  song and then updating it with contemporary production.

406
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,080
Speaker 11:  Where's that pile.

407
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,280
Speaker 5:  This is one of those cases where a music catalog company

408
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,360
Speaker 5:  helped facilitate the revival of this

409
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,240
Speaker 5:  body of work. And I think it's an amazing song. I love the new

410
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,480
Speaker 5:  version.

411
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,760
Speaker 4:  So these, these studios who are buying all of these catalogs

412
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:53,680
Speaker 4:  because they want this predictable revenue, because like, I guess

413
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,040
Speaker 4:  music, like all forms of entertainment is not predictable in its revenue.

414
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,200
Speaker 4:  Is this kind of a newer thing in music? Have they been doing this a while

415
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,920
Speaker 4:  that this predictability play?

416
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,960
Speaker 5:  Well, certainly streaming has changed how publishers

417
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,240
Speaker 5:  perceive the lifetime value of their work. Music catalogs

418
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,200
Speaker 5:  have always been valuable and people have made a

419
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,920
Speaker 5:  lot of money off of legacy artists and owning that

420
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,800
Speaker 5:  publishing. That's not new there's AAL

421
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,760
Speaker 5:  story about Paul McCartney telling Michael Jackson, Hey, it's

422
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,320
Speaker 5:  a really good idea to own publishing. Like there's a lot of value in it.

423
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,480
Speaker 5:  And Michael Jackson went behind his back and bought the Beatles cattle off

424
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,360
Speaker 5:  the end. Paul was not so happy about that. So there's always been value

425
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,160
Speaker 5:  in it. What has changed is that streaming provides more predictable

426
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,600
Speaker 5:  revenues. You can see how your revenues are changing literally, you know,

427
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,520
Speaker 5:  day by day and previously you would've had to relied on physical

428
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,440
Speaker 5:  retailers. And of course, if you have a legacy catalog, maintaining shelf

429
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,320
Speaker 5:  space in a physical location is more challenging. When so

430
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
Speaker 5:  much new music is being released on streaming, fandoms are able to

431
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,760
Speaker 5:  continue listening. If you're a boomer and you love boomer music,

432
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,680
Speaker 5:  you're gonna keep listening to that on Spotify. You know, if you're from

433
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,120
Speaker 5:  the greatest generation and you really love listening

434
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,280
Speaker 5:  to the old classics of pop music, you probably couldn't find

435
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,800
Speaker 5:  them at best buy today. But if that's your thing, you can find playlists.

436
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,440
Speaker 5:  You can find them music, you can be engaged with it on streaming in a way

437
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,320
Speaker 5:  that provides some predictability now. And so it's not hard to build

438
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,280
Speaker 5:  out financial forecasts of this is how much money this artist is making over

439
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,240
Speaker 5:  streaming year over year. Is it growing? Is it declining? And you can predict

440
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,880
Speaker 5:  what those the revenues might be, which is all predicated on. Listener behavior

441
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,600
Speaker 5:  is going to be the same in the future as it is today. And we don't know about

442
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,120
Speaker 5:  that, but

443
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,280
Speaker 4:  You've got these companies who are going, they're buying this music and they're

444
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,960
Speaker 4:  saying, okay, I know I can predict this. And then I also know I can

445
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,360
Speaker 4:  get somebody to go do an interpolation. I can go have a whole

446
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,920
Speaker 4:  bunch of let's slow it down. So it'll look, sound great

447
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,960
Speaker 4:  on a movie trailer to know just how dramatic it is.

448
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,600
Speaker 5:  If you wanna be CRAs and think about music as a marketplace, listeners have

449
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,280
Speaker 5:  to want this kind of music in the sixties. The worst thing you could

450
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,200
Speaker 5:  possibly do was to sell out and work with a brand. And now it's like, if

451
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,160
Speaker 5:  you're not working with a brand, you're not a real artist. So ideas around

452
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,480
Speaker 5:  this in culture are gonna change, but listeners are

453
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,120
Speaker 5:  definitely tuning into this music and it's working. And, and so I think

454
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,080
Speaker 5:  you see the suppliers of this music are recognizing, okay, we need to figure

455
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,760
Speaker 5:  out how to supply more of this and do it. Well, all of the publishers

456
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,960
Speaker 5:  I've spoken with work very hard to

457
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,720
Speaker 5:  maintain high quality. Now that obviously is

458
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,040
Speaker 5:  extremely subjective, but they're not just letting their catalog out there.

459
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,840
Speaker 5:  Willy-nilly saying, Hey, go cover this song. Do whatever you want with it.

460
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,760
Speaker 5:  They're trying to connect old songs with new artists where there is a,

461
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,960
Speaker 5:  a really strong, resonant connection that fans are gonna love.

462
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,920
Speaker 5:  They're getting approvals on the songs, the usages,

463
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,080
Speaker 5:  et cetera, et cetera. And hypnosis sounds. For example, told me over email

464
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,960
Speaker 5:  that they usually tell the artists who did the

465
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,840
Speaker 5:  recording originally, that this is gonna happen even when they

466
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,760
Speaker 5:  don't need to, because a lot of these deals are like these publishers just

467
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,880
Speaker 5:  own all of it. So they don't need to get the artist's permission in some

468
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,840
Speaker 5:  cases they do, but they do so anyway, because you don't wanna mess with

469
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,440
Speaker 5:  these legacies, right? If you're going to use old

470
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,320
Speaker 5:  IP, don't mess it up because it's actually gonna potentially hurt the

471
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,600
Speaker 5:  entire value of the overall catalog. So I think people are trying to do this

472
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,200
Speaker 5:  intelligently and do it in a way that builds value

473
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,280
Speaker 5:  rather than dilutes it. So the publisher pitching part

474
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,080
Speaker 5:  of it is definitely important, but I think it's just one part of

475
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,000
Speaker 5:  the marketplace of how we are listening to old hits and new ways.

476
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:39,760
Speaker 5:  Is

477
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,520
Speaker 4:  There an end date for this kind of business model where they, they buy the

478
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,400
Speaker 4:  catalogs, they put 'em on streaming and then they work with a lot of artists

479
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,880
Speaker 4:  and stuff to do remixes to do interpolations. Is there an end date to that?

480
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,920
Speaker 4:  A point where like there just aren't any more artists who can do these songs

481
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,080
Speaker 4:  or there aren't any more artists who you can buy the catalogs from

482
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,320
Speaker 5:  Pop is always turning over. So there will always be new acts coming along,

483
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,880
Speaker 5:  but there are a couple of end dates. One, you have to have a fandom,

484
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,560
Speaker 5:  you know, not a lot of people are currently buying, say

485
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,160
Speaker 5:  John Phillips's music who was one of the biggest pop stars

486
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,840
Speaker 5:  of the 19th century. It's

487
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,080
Speaker 4:  Just me.

488
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,640
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. Okay. That's awesome. I mean, if people still play the SAF phone,

489
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,120
Speaker 5:  that's awesome. But like horn music from that era is not very popular

490
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,120
Speaker 5:  today. We might hear it in marching bands, et cetera, but generally

491
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,320
Speaker 5:  that's not driving pop music. You also have copyright explorations.

492
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,080
Speaker 5:  So at some point all work will enter the public domain, but that is a

493
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,600
Speaker 5:  long period of time, many generations. And I think you're gonna see a lot

494
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,280
Speaker 5:  of music publishers pursuing Disney's strategy, which is

495
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,160
Speaker 5:  maintaining the lifetime of your intellectual property and trying to constantly

496
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:51,080
Speaker 5:  reignite it so that the fandom for that thing grows

497
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,920
Speaker 5:  and at least sustains an ongoing business

498
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,800
Speaker 5:  for each of these mini artist brands.

499
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,640
Speaker 4:  And when all else fails, they will go petition the government to make sure

500
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,560
Speaker 4:  they can hold Mickey mouse forever. Do you think

501
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Speaker 4:  we'll see the music labels doing that as well

502
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,680
Speaker 5:  In the music community. There's probably a mixture of what people want. Some

503
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,200
Speaker 5:  people want, like, let me sample anything. I wanna pay. Certainly the people

504
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,720
Speaker 5:  who own the intellectual property are working to maintain the lifetime value

505
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,280
Speaker 5:  of that in the longest possible way that they can. Yeah. And so

506
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,240
Speaker 5:  certainly I know for a fact there are labels that don't want

507
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,840
Speaker 5:  to believe in, for example, fair use, because they would prefer

508
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,320
Speaker 5:  that in every case, people pay for any instance

509
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,440
Speaker 5:  of recognizing that music, which is why we see an increase in

510
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,160
Speaker 5:  music docs that are actually like owned and operated by the artists.

511
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Speaker 5:  Those are not docs. Those that is artist

512
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,400
Speaker 5:  propaganda. They can be fun. You should watch them enjoy them. That's totally

513
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,080
Speaker 5:  fun, but that's not a documentary, but so many music docs today are sold

514
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,720
Speaker 5:  as a doc. When actually it is a, like someone with complete

515
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,280
Speaker 5:  creative control about how they are being represented.

516
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,800
Speaker 4:  Is there any kind of music trend that you're seeing right now that you think

517
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,720
Speaker 4:  that's the one that's the future of music? Cuz a lot of these we've talked

518
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,800
Speaker 4:  about, you're like, you know what, this is gonna be part of the future. This

519
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,720
Speaker 4:  isn't the fabric of the future of music. Is there any, that's like just stand

520
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,280
Speaker 4:  out to you.

521
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,880
Speaker 5:  I'm not gonna put my Oracle hat on for a very specific reason,

522
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,760
Speaker 5:  which is that I think music is one of the fastest moving media

523
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,400
Speaker 5:  format that the culture around music evolves so

524
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,600
Speaker 5:  quickly. Every time people wanna say all pop music sounds the same. It's

525
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,480
Speaker 5:  like just listen to what pop music sounded like five years ago does not sound

526
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,400
Speaker 5:  the same. It updates and changes. It's very, chameleonic I

527
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,240
Speaker 5:  can't tell you the combination of how pop music is gonna sound, how it's

528
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,800
Speaker 5:  gonna be created and how technology is going to inform it. Because I think

529
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,480
Speaker 5:  it's gonna shift every single year, even when we get to the point

530
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,360
Speaker 5:  where AI is going to perfectly recreate a song, if, and when

531
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,120
Speaker 5:  that happens and create new, interesting music, humans are still gonna participate

532
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,560
Speaker 5:  in music in wild and creative ways that I can't even possibly imagine

533
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,800
Speaker 5:  it's all gonna happen so fast that I just would

534
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,360
Speaker 5:  feel irresponsible to pinpoint like this is the thing that's gonna be around

535
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,320
Speaker 5:  for the next hundred years. I mean, again, I love the za phone, but

536
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,120
Speaker 5:  it's got a very particular place. At one point it was very, very popular.

537
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,800
Speaker 5:  You know, it's like, it's just all gonna change

538
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,880
Speaker 4:  All of these. Interpolations all of these remixes. Are we just kind of,

539
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,720
Speaker 4:  I don't know if it's doomed as the right word they're they're absolute pops,

540
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,720
Speaker 4:  but are we, are we gonna just be in this loop, this endless loop

541
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,480
Speaker 4:  of recall,

542
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,440
Speaker 5:  We definitely seem to be living in the greatest era of nostalgia

543
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,400
Speaker 5:  and that is reflected. I think in all of our media and it particularly

544
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,720
Speaker 5:  is true in popular music. Interpolations are on the rise.

545
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,800
Speaker 5:  It seems like every year there's a new throwback to a previous

546
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,560
Speaker 5:  generation. We are very much into the eighties in disco right now. One of

547
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,200
Speaker 5:  the biggest albums in the last couple years was DPA's future nostalgia. And

548
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,560
Speaker 5:  it is an update to the disco sound

549
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,800
Speaker 7:  Thinking about

550
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,000
Speaker 7:  big change me.

551
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:05,200
Speaker 5:  We are, I think in a nostalgia loop, I maintain that. I think

552
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,160
Speaker 5:  the ideas around pop culture and what's going to be interesting will change

553
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,120
Speaker 5:  and that at some point nostalgia will be frowned upon, but

554
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:17,040
Speaker 5:  we are in it for a minute. There's no doubt about that. I think every

555
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,520
Speaker 5:  musician's secretly hopes for the moment where actually what's gonna happen

556
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,000
Speaker 5:  is we're going to go to the most avant-garde weird thing that's ever been

557
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,880
Speaker 5:  created. And you know, we, we lean on artists like Bjork and other folks

558
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,280
Speaker 5:  to, to help push those sort of boundaries and help change our understanding

559
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,240
Speaker 5:  of what music can sound like. It's always gonna be a push and a pull.

560
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,680
Speaker 4:  Ah, I love it. All right. Well thank you Charlie so much for, for taking
