Description: On today's show: sleep gadgets, AI DJs, and sneaky TVs. Victoria Song joins the show to talk about her experiences with the Eight Sleep mattress pad, the Oura Ring 4, and other sleep gadgets. Can you really measure your way to a better night of sleep? After that, Allison Johnson gives us her take on Spotify's AI DJ, and we wonder exactly how an AI tool is supposed to help us find and listen to music. Finally, Nilay Patel comes on to answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline about the Samsung Frame TVs — and how to figure out whether you need a TV at all.

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,995
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Quantified REM

3
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:10,475
Speaker 2:  Cycles. I'm my friend David Pierce and I am playing

4
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:13,715
Speaker 2:  Batman AUM Shadow on the Quest three.

5
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:18,955
Speaker 2:  I tend to always have one game that I like to play on the Quest,

6
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:22,755
Speaker 2:  usually for just like 15 or 20 minutes at a time in between

7
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:26,675
Speaker 2:  meetings or at night just to kind of move around. I like this better than,

8
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:29,675
Speaker 2:  you know, sitting on the couch playing video games, even though frankly I

9
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:32,755
Speaker 2:  do a lot of that too. This at least kind of gets the blood going in a way

10
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:36,595
Speaker 2:  that I really like. For a long time it was super hot vr then it was

11
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:40,435
Speaker 2:  supernatural when I was feeling like exercise. Then there was a tennis

12
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:44,395
Speaker 2:  simulator that I got strangely into, but I kept hitting the ceiling

13
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:48,235
Speaker 2:  trying to do serves, so that didn't last. And now I'm playing AUM

14
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:52,195
Speaker 2:  shadow. I have loved all of the AUM games over the years. They're

15
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:56,035
Speaker 2:  like the perfect mix for me of lots to do, but pretty

16
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,635
Speaker 2:  straightforward and they don't require me to just wander aimlessly for hours.

17
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:03,075
Speaker 2:  Very much my kind of game. By the way, there's a decent chance you've heard

18
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:06,835
Speaker 2:  ads for this game on this podcast. I've gotten some

19
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:10,195
Speaker 2:  complaints from people who were like too many meta ads in a row and I can

20
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,115
Speaker 2:  only assume they're for ACOM shadow. So trust me, this is

21
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,475
Speaker 2:  not one of those ads. I'm happy to tell you all of the things I hate about

22
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:21,435
Speaker 2:  both this game and the quest in general, but this game's pretty

23
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:24,395
Speaker 2:  great. I'm having a nice time. Anyway, that is not what we're here to talk

24
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:28,235
Speaker 2:  about today. We are here to do two things on the show. First,

25
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:32,395
Speaker 2:  we're gonna talk to V Song about kind of a year of experiments

26
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:35,955
Speaker 2:  in Quantified sleep that she's been doing. She's tried some gadgets,

27
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,675
Speaker 2:  she's tried some more expensive gadgets, she's tried some really expensive

28
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:43,475
Speaker 2:  gadgets and we're gonna talk about whether any of them are

29
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:47,075
Speaker 2:  actually worth it and have made her sleep better. Then we're gonna talk to

30
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,955
Speaker 2:  Alison Johnson about the AI DJ on Spotify and what it means

31
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:54,875
Speaker 2:  to have a computer decide what is good and what you should listen

32
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,955
Speaker 2:  to. She wrote a really great piece about it. I have some thoughts. I actually

33
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:01,155
Speaker 2:  disagree with her in some ways, so we're gonna get into it. We also have

34
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:04,595
Speaker 2:  a question from the hotline to do lots of fun stuff coming up on this episode.

35
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:09,155
Speaker 2:  But first we'll get to that, but I have to go beat up some

36
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:12,355
Speaker 2:  bad guys on the streets of Gotham. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right

37
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:12,515
Speaker 2:  back.

38
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:55,455
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So we talk a lot on this show about the

39
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:59,485
Speaker 2:  idea of tracking yourself and using wearables

40
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:03,045
Speaker 2:  to get data about your biometrics and the whole idea of the quantified

41
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:07,165
Speaker 2:  self, which to be honest is a phrase that I really hate, but

42
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:10,485
Speaker 2:  it just means tracking something in order to be able to do it better.

43
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:15,285
Speaker 2:  The thing we don't talk about as much with that I think is sleep.

44
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:18,965
Speaker 2:  We talk a lot about exercise, we talk some about food and things like that

45
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:22,845
Speaker 2:  and all that stuff is good, but I think If, you wanted to make everyone's

46
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:26,365
Speaker 2:  lives better immediately. Getting everybody better sleep

47
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:30,285
Speaker 2:  would be the way. So V Song on our team has been testing

48
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:34,205
Speaker 2:  a bunch of sleep related gadgets. She's actually been doing this for a long

49
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:37,885
Speaker 2:  time, both as part of testing lots of wearables, but

50
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:41,845
Speaker 2:  also just because like the rest of us she'd like to get more sleep.

51
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:46,205
Speaker 2:  So I figured now would be a super fun time to have her on the show and talk

52
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:49,485
Speaker 2:  through all of this. She's tried some cheap stuff, she's tried some

53
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:52,965
Speaker 2:  absurdly expensive stuff and we're gonna see if any of it is actually worth

54
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,605
Speaker 2:  the money and actually helps you sleep. V song. Hello.

55
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:57,605
Speaker 4:  Hello.

56
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:02,045
Speaker 2:  Okay, so a few weeks ago you were here on the show and I said

57
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:05,965
Speaker 2:  something about how I think sleep tracking is stupid. I don't think I said

58
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:09,125
Speaker 2:  those exact words, but I said something like those exact words and I would

59
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,885
Speaker 2:  say A surprising number of people have had feelings at

60
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:16,845
Speaker 2:  me about that feeling and have told me that I'm wrong. And

61
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:20,765
Speaker 2:  it turns out that you, without even telling me at

62
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:23,805
Speaker 2:  that moment when you could have told me, have been doing all kinds of interesting

63
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,165
Speaker 2:  sleep tracking research over the last several months, So I wanna talk about

64
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:31,005
Speaker 2:  it and I wanna talk especially about the, the thing

65
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:34,725
Speaker 2:  that you tried to do where you tried to convince people that it's not insane

66
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:38,625
Speaker 2:  to spend many thousands of dollars on your bed. But before we get to

67
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,345
Speaker 2:  all of that, I wanna talk about sleep maxing you.

68
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:45,625
Speaker 2:  You brought up in one of your recent stories, this thing that I find really

69
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:49,625
Speaker 2:  fascinating, which is that sleep tracking has become the

70
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,625
Speaker 2:  thing in a, in a way that I can't remember

71
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,265
Speaker 2:  this sort of quantified self trend being

72
00:04:57,315 --> 00:05:01,225
Speaker 2:  mainstream quite like this maybe ever, or at least

73
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:05,225
Speaker 2:  since the like get 10,000 steps craze, right? Sort of took

74
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:09,105
Speaker 2:  over everybody. Like sleep is, it's such a thing, it's

75
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:12,945
Speaker 2:  having such a moment and I'm curious what you make

76
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,345
Speaker 2:  of that. Like how, why do you think sleep has gone viral in the way that

77
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:16,665
Speaker 2:  it has?

78
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:21,185
Speaker 4:  So, I think that we all feel a lot of existential dread

79
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:25,385
Speaker 4:  and there are so many things that are externally out of our control

80
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:29,585
Speaker 4:  at the same time, like you have a lot of really health conscious people at

81
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:33,025
Speaker 4:  this point in time. I attribute that in like my little bubble to

82
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:37,105
Speaker 4:  like all of these devices that Apple Samsung Google say will save your

83
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:41,065
Speaker 4:  life. And you know, these are things you can by and large control,

84
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:45,345
Speaker 4:  sleep, you know, talk to any doctor, they're gonna tell you get a

85
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,265
Speaker 4:  good night's worth of sleep, sleep, eat nutrient dense

86
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:53,185
Speaker 4:  foods, exercise. Every single health professional is gonna tell you

87
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:57,105
Speaker 4:  that If, you can master these three things, your life will be better. Like

88
00:05:57,275 --> 00:06:01,205
Speaker 4:  they, you know, and I think that message really does kind

89
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:04,845
Speaker 4:  of just solidify when you hit your thirties and things

90
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,965
Speaker 4:  start creaking and you have disposable income and you

91
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:12,605
Speaker 4:  just realize, oh man, like sleep actually is pretty

92
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,405
Speaker 4:  important. These doctors, they're actually not lying. If my

93
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:20,285
Speaker 4:  sleep is bad, I feel bad. If my sleep is good, I feel good.

94
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:24,485
Speaker 4:  So it's a very easy way to just

95
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:28,885
Speaker 4:  dramatically improve the things that you can control. Like your anxiety will

96
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:32,525
Speaker 4:  go down If, you sleep well, your health will

97
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,525
Speaker 4:  improve. If, you sleep well, it'll be easier for you to lose weight. If,

98
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,805
Speaker 4:  you sleep well, it'll be easier for you to build muscle If, you sleep well,

99
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:42,165
Speaker 4:  it'll be easier for you to just do literally anything and have better mental

100
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:45,805
Speaker 4:  health. If, you sleep well. So, I think that's kind of where this

101
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:50,005
Speaker 4:  intensity around sleep maxing comes from. And you know, like what

102
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:53,285
Speaker 4:  is sleep maxing? Sleep maxing is literally just buying

103
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:57,445
Speaker 4:  several products to try and hack your sleep, right? So it's,

104
00:06:57,445 --> 00:07:01,205
Speaker 4:  it's like really a convergence of late stage capitalism

105
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:05,005
Speaker 4:  and existential dread shaking hands like that meme in your

106
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,885
Speaker 4:  TikTok shop to tell you like If, you just do this one thing, you might

107
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:12,765
Speaker 4:  sleep a little bit better and feel better while you deal with a bunch

108
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,605
Speaker 4:  of other crap. And So I think that's honestly where it

109
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:20,445
Speaker 4:  comes from and they're not wrong is is the thing I'm gonna

110
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:20,645
Speaker 4:  say.

111
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:24,245
Speaker 2:  Well, and I think it's true. I mean it, it strikes me as you explain those

112
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:28,205
Speaker 2:  three things that eat better, exercise more and sleep more essentially

113
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:32,965
Speaker 2:  sleep better is by far the least

114
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:37,525
Speaker 2:  costly of those three things. Like eating better is hard.

115
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:41,445
Speaker 2:  It like yes, all the tasty foods are bad for you. It's just,

116
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:42,925
Speaker 2:  it's just a fact of the universe.

117
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,765
Speaker 4:  It's hard. It's a thing I struggle with the most.

118
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:49,885
Speaker 2:  It's, it's more expensive, it's more complicated. Like it's very hard to

119
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:53,725
Speaker 2:  eat well, it's also hard to exercise a lot. It just

120
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,925
Speaker 2:  requires a lot of commitment and dedication and the opportunity cost is high

121
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:00,725
Speaker 2:  because I could be sitting on my couch watching television and I'm not

122
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:01,365
Speaker 2:  also

123
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:04,485
Speaker 4:  It's painful. Yeah, it sucks. It's painful. Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:08,565
Speaker 2:  And kudos to you who you get up and do it anyway.

125
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:13,285
Speaker 2:  Sleep has in theory none of those costs.

126
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:17,525
Speaker 2:  Like if I can, I'm going to lie in bed for eight hours at night

127
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:21,205
Speaker 2:  if I can make those eight hours more efficient, that is all upside,

128
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:25,205
Speaker 2:  right? Like it's the only one of those three that in that if getting

129
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,645
Speaker 2:  better sleep has zero downsides,

130
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:31,925
Speaker 4:  It's also enjoyable. Getting a good night's sleep is

131
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:35,645
Speaker 4:  really great. It's the most enjoyable of these three things that you can

132
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:36,245
Speaker 4:  fix your life,

133
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:39,165
Speaker 2:  Right? It would be one thing if like the activity of going to sleep really

134
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:40,725
Speaker 2:  sucked, but like going to sleep is great,

135
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:41,885
Speaker 4:  It's so good.

136
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,965
Speaker 2:  It's not like exercise that way where you feel really good at the end but

137
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:47,365
Speaker 2:  not during sleep is just awesome the whole time.

138
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:50,885
Speaker 4:  It's just great. The whole, like whenever you see someone going to bed and

139
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:53,365
Speaker 4:  they're sleeping you, so they're always like sleeping with a little smile

140
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:57,445
Speaker 4:  on their face, a sleeping baby, good vibes. And like you

141
00:08:57,445 --> 00:09:00,925
Speaker 4:  look at insomniacs, they have bags under their eyes. They generally don't

142
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:04,845
Speaker 4:  look good. So like just culturally speaking, sleep is by far

143
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,045
Speaker 4:  the easiest thing you can do and it's, you know,

144
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:12,605
Speaker 4:  in terms of like effort put into results immediately seen,

145
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:16,925
Speaker 4:  you will immediately feel the effects of good sleep. Whereas you will not

146
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:20,445
Speaker 4:  immediately feel the effects of sticking to a nutritious diet or

147
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:24,365
Speaker 4:  exercising over a long period of time. Like those, those things are all

148
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,365
Speaker 4:  like I, you know, you should do them, they're gonna suck while you do them

149
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:30,805
Speaker 4:  and you have to have delayed gratification. There's none of that

150
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:34,325
Speaker 4:  complicatedness with sleep. Sleep instant gratification.

151
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:38,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it'll feel good literally in hours and you won't have to

152
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:39,885
Speaker 4:  do anything at all.

153
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:43,485
Speaker 2:  It's pretty great. Yeah. So it seems like in in that

154
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:48,165
Speaker 2:  vein of trying to do better with sleep a, there's a lot of snake oil.

155
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:51,325
Speaker 2:  I mostly don't wanna talk about the snake oil, but I think by and large If

156
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,725
Speaker 2:  you see a thing on TikTok in the TikTok shop, you should assume it's nonsense.

157
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:58,125
Speaker 2:  I think that's true of everything definitely including sleep maxing

158
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:02,205
Speaker 4:  Mouth tape. I legitimately that makes me angry.

159
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,205
Speaker 4:  Mouth tape. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah,

160
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,365
Speaker 2:  We're just gonna leave that as aside. But it seems to me there are sort of

161
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:10,245
Speaker 2:  two separate things that the tech

162
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,325
Speaker 2:  industry has to figure out here. One is how to

163
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:17,445
Speaker 2:  successfully tell how you're sleeping, right? Like the, and

164
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:20,085
Speaker 2:  the sleep tracking thing has been happening for forever. The reason we were

165
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,165
Speaker 2:  talking about this a few weeks ago is we were talking about the Oura Ring,

166
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,325
Speaker 2:  like the idea of using some device or another to track

167
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,605
Speaker 2:  your sleep goes back a long ways. So I would assume

168
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:32,325
Speaker 2:  we're pretty good at that. Now are we pretty good at that now?

169
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:37,165
Speaker 4:  We are okay at that now. Okay. So what we are really

170
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:41,045
Speaker 4:  good at is telling when you go to sleep and when you wake

171
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:44,765
Speaker 4:  up the sleep stages, so like the REM sleep, the

172
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:47,965
Speaker 4:  deep sleep, the light sleep dubious,

173
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,005
Speaker 2:  Okay. And that stuff is really important.

174
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:54,445
Speaker 4:  That stuff is important. If, you wanna get more granular or if

175
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,645
Speaker 4:  you're having sleep problems and you're trying to self like figure out like

176
00:10:57,745 --> 00:10:58,645
Speaker 4:  what's going on,

177
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:04,205
Speaker 4:  you know, so aura, they put a lot of research into it, but

178
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:08,045
Speaker 4:  even there only, like our algorithm is like, I think it's 70 to

179
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:11,885
Speaker 4:  80% in agreement with the gold standard,

180
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:15,645
Speaker 4:  which is polysomnography. And that's when you go into a little

181
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:18,405
Speaker 4:  clinic and they put stuff on you and you sleep there for a night and the

182
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:21,725
Speaker 4:  scientists watch you and measure your brainwaves. So that's the clinical

183
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:25,645
Speaker 4:  gold standard. And most consumer grade sleep trackers that are out there

184
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:29,085
Speaker 4:  on the market, we're at best we are getting around

185
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:32,485
Speaker 4:  70%, 70 to 80% in, in that range. Okay. So

186
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:36,965
Speaker 4:  you know, like eh, so we're, we're much better than we used to be. But

187
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:41,205
Speaker 4:  in the grand scheme of things, you do have to really take it as a

188
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:44,645
Speaker 4:  very unsatisfying, oh this is my baseline.

189
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:49,715
Speaker 4:  I probably will know when I have a crappy night of sleep. Yeah. Right?

190
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:53,765
Speaker 4:  But you can from that BA baseline view trends like, oh

191
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:57,405
Speaker 4:  you have a lot of breathing disturbances, maybe you have sleep

192
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:00,965
Speaker 4:  apnea and you should go to a doctor and maybe get

193
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:03,365
Speaker 4:  A-C-P-A-P and see how that

194
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:08,005
Speaker 4:  improves your sleep quality. So like that's kind of the real

195
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:12,005
Speaker 4:  thought process behind sleep tracking as well as like

196
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:15,965
Speaker 4:  another really valuable thing is having a sleep routine. So

197
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:19,725
Speaker 4:  something that a sleep tracker can do is help you build that sleep routine

198
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:23,685
Speaker 4:  by going, you regularly go to sleep at this time and wake up at this time.

199
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:27,845
Speaker 4:  Good job buddy. You are super consistent with that, right? Or

200
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:31,045
Speaker 4:  you know, if you're just really having crappy sleep and you see that you

201
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:34,085
Speaker 4:  wake up a ton of times in the night and you go, aha, that is the 3:00 AM

202
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:38,485
Speaker 4:  cat is angry at standard time and that kibble

203
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:42,125
Speaker 4:  is not coming at the time that they are used to. So they screamed and woke

204
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,245
Speaker 4:  me up. Like you can view patterns and trends kind of easily in that way.

205
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:49,045
Speaker 4:  It just, it's not super automatic, right? Because you have to tag

206
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:53,325
Speaker 4:  like Angry Cat, like some of my sleep tracking devices, it's

207
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:57,165
Speaker 4:  literally got an angry cat tag. And I can tell you they wake

208
00:12:57,165 --> 00:13:00,525
Speaker 4:  me up quite frequently because they're angry. But I don't need a sleep tracker

209
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:03,925
Speaker 4:  for that. 'cause obviously the cat is hitting me in the face and whatnot.

210
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:04,445
Speaker 4:  So,

211
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:08,165
Speaker 2:  Well So I, that's been the challenge with me with sleep tracking for forever,

212
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:12,165
Speaker 2:  right? Which is, I think the idea that it tells you when you went

213
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,765
Speaker 2:  to bed and when you woke up is nothing

214
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:20,325
Speaker 2:  like I know that I don't, it's, it's like, it's like if

215
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:23,085
Speaker 2:  the only thing a fitness tracker could tell me was that I went for a walk,

216
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:27,245
Speaker 2:  like I don't need that. That's, that's not helpful. But I will

217
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:30,605
Speaker 2:  say to the credit of these devices, I think the thing you just said about

218
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:33,445
Speaker 2:  these kind of macro trends that it can give back to you.

219
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:38,405
Speaker 2:  One thing that happened to me very recently was my wife and I got a sleep

220
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:41,765
Speaker 2:  number bed a few years ago. We went from trying to

221
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:45,725
Speaker 2:  perpetually compromise on firmness to just being like, we need a bed

222
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:49,685
Speaker 2:  with two different firmness. So we got a sleep number bed, it's fine, we

223
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:52,405
Speaker 2:  got like the cheapest crappiest one, it's fine, but it does the thing we

224
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:55,925
Speaker 2:  need it to do and it gives me like a sleep score every morning. And I think

225
00:13:57,105 --> 00:14:01,005
Speaker 2:  the sleep score is mostly meaningless generally speaking. But one thing it

226
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:04,445
Speaker 2:  did for me over time was it said, Hey David, just

227
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:08,445
Speaker 2:  FYI your sleep scores tend to be the best when you go to bed about 11 and

228
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:11,805
Speaker 2:  you wake up about six 30. And it was just like that, just that one thing.

229
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:14,925
Speaker 2:  It was like, okay, this seven and a half hour window of sleep

230
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:19,885
Speaker 2:  seems to be what you need in order to be successful. And that

231
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:22,805
Speaker 2:  was, so it was one of those things I like never really paid attention to,

232
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:27,165
Speaker 2:  but was so helpful that like a, that's about the amount of sleep I need

233
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:31,445
Speaker 2:  to be a successful functioning adult, but also this

234
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:35,365
Speaker 2:  window actually kind of works was very helpful. And I'm

235
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:38,405
Speaker 2:  like that that alone is like, okay, we've now you've done something for me

236
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:39,845
Speaker 2:  that I would not have done on my own.

237
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:44,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's, that's honestly the thing about self quantification is that

238
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:48,005
Speaker 4:  it takes a really long time to tell you something useful. Yeah, that's so

239
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:51,005
Speaker 4:  true. And sometimes the stuff that it points out to

240
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:55,565
Speaker 4:  you is gonna be super obvious to everyone else, but to yourself you're like,

241
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:57,805
Speaker 4:  oh, I never really thought about that. Oh, I never really paid attention

242
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:01,325
Speaker 4:  to that. So on the surface it's all really dumb,

243
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:05,565
Speaker 4:  but one thing that they show time and time again is that logging these things

244
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:08,885
Speaker 4:  will make you more aware of them. So like, I personally

245
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:13,325
Speaker 4:  hate calorie tracking, I hate logging food. I

246
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:17,245
Speaker 4:  also have learned a lot about logging my food over time. Like I am just

247
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:20,245
Speaker 4:  like, oh, I was extremely protein deficient. I thought I was getting enough

248
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:23,845
Speaker 4:  protein. No I wasn't. Hmm. Oh, I tend to like

249
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:27,885
Speaker 4:  stress eat. Oh wow. That like when you have to log all the things that you're

250
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:31,645
Speaker 4:  stress eating, you will be more aware of those habits. So that's

251
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:35,885
Speaker 4:  primarily the benefit of sleep tracking. Even if on the surface you

252
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:38,285
Speaker 4:  look at it and you're just like, well, duh.

253
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:42,245
Speaker 2:  Like yeah. I had one the other night where my, my sleep score was 14

254
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,925
Speaker 2:  because I, I went to bed and I got up

255
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:50,045
Speaker 2:  at two o'clock with a toddler who didn't wanna go back to sleep and I spent

256
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:52,885
Speaker 2:  the whole rest of the night in his room and it's like, yeah, thanks bed.

257
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,725
Speaker 2:  I got a notification that I got a 14. Like that's how that thank you. Great.

258
00:15:56,835 --> 00:16:00,325
Speaker 2:  Cool. Helpful. Which brings me to the second thing that I think is,

259
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,605
Speaker 2:  is complicated and interesting in this space right now is step one

260
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:08,565
Speaker 2:  is like figure out how you're doing, right? And step two is make it better.

261
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:12,805
Speaker 2:  And I think the challenge with a lot of these devices, all these

262
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,845
Speaker 2:  wearables, and this is the thing we've talked about many times is the the

263
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:19,445
Speaker 2:  so what the, like what do I do about this thing? Right? And like

264
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:24,325
Speaker 2:  you've seen this on the Apple watch where it'll like prompt you to go for

265
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:27,285
Speaker 2:  a walk at the end of the night to hit your goals. And sometimes that's good

266
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:30,605
Speaker 2:  and sometimes I'm like, shut up. I don't wanna go for a 61 minute walk at

267
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:34,085
Speaker 2:  10:00 PM to hit my goals A BRI walk. Yeah. Like, I'm good. Thank you Apple.

268
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:39,365
Speaker 2:  But I think the, the trick with sleep is figuring out how to make

269
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:43,125
Speaker 2:  things better. And I think this is what brings us to v's.

270
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:47,005
Speaker 2:  Adventures in $5,000 mattresses. Let's just, just

271
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,725
Speaker 2:  explain this thing to me that you've been sleeping on for the last few months.

272
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:54,285
Speaker 4:  I've been sleeping on the Eight Sleep Pod four Ultra. I have

273
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:58,405
Speaker 4:  previously tested the Eight Sleep Pod two Pro cover. And

274
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:02,205
Speaker 4:  basically this is a smart mattress cover.

275
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:05,885
Speaker 4:  It's not even the mattress. The mattress is my mattress that I spent

276
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:10,125
Speaker 4:  a good amount of money on because I really do think

277
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,605
Speaker 4:  you should invest in sleep. Oh, I agree. Clearly

278
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:16,765
Speaker 2:  A good couch and a good mattress are like the two grownup purchases

279
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:19,885
Speaker 2:  I think are worth all of the outrageous amounts of dollars you will spend

280
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:20,085
Speaker 2:  on them.

281
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:24,365
Speaker 4:  I I, I personally spent seven years in Japan sleeping on

282
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:28,205
Speaker 4:  a really cheap futon. And I actually got several

283
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:32,565
Speaker 4:  musculoskeletal like pain to the point where my doctor sat me down

284
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:36,445
Speaker 4:  in Japan and in Japanese was just like, Victoria Sun, you need

285
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:37,725
Speaker 4:  to buy an actual mattress.

286
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:39,725
Speaker 2:  So,

287
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,165
Speaker 4:  You know, that was a huge life lessons for me. So take

288
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:47,645
Speaker 4:  this into context that when I was saying, you know, I was willing to

289
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,245
Speaker 4:  test and seriously consider a

290
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:53,845
Speaker 4:  $4,700 mattress for

291
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:56,285
Speaker 4:  not mattress but mattress cover.

292
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:57,445
Speaker 2:  Right? Not even a

293
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:01,485
Speaker 4:  Mattress. Not even a mattress, a cover with a, a base

294
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:05,045
Speaker 4:  at the bottom so the base will elevate. So you can use that

295
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:09,285
Speaker 4:  manually and be like, hey, I feel like being comfy while I read. And so it'll

296
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:13,165
Speaker 4:  elevate you in that way. But the more like sleep maxing bits of it is that

297
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:16,765
Speaker 4:  there is like a special position where it slightly elevates

298
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:17,445
Speaker 4:  your feet

299
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:22,885
Speaker 4:  for sleep position and supposedly the AI in this

300
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:26,605
Speaker 4:  thing will adjust the position of the bed while you're sleeping to minimize

301
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,405
Speaker 4:  snoring. I have woken up while it's been moving the bed.

302
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:33,565
Speaker 4:  Oh no. To make my spouse stop snoring. I was

303
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:35,845
Speaker 2:  Just about to say, who's the snorer in the bed, which is, it's

304
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:39,405
Speaker 4:  Not me. I have quantifiable proof in our marriage that I am not the one

305
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:43,365
Speaker 4:  snoring. Okay. So haha. So you know, you know, this can be great fodder

306
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:47,325
Speaker 4:  or not in your marriage to be like, I am not

307
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:51,085
Speaker 4:  the snore, you sir are the snore. But you know, I have

308
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:55,245
Speaker 4:  actually woken up while this bed has been adjusting and watched

309
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:59,245
Speaker 4:  as they're snoring dramatically lessened. And just like in a sleep adult

310
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:03,045
Speaker 4:  state going like, oh, you mean I don't have

311
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:06,525
Speaker 4:  to like smack you and be like, wake up, you're snoring. It's woken me up.

312
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:10,565
Speaker 4:  I can just go like, oh, this is a fever dream going back to sleep and whatnot.

313
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,005
Speaker 4:  So that is one thing that it does. But the thing that they're most famous

314
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:18,005
Speaker 4:  for doing, I certainly buried the s lead, is that it adjusts

315
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:21,685
Speaker 4:  the temperature, right? So there's tubing inside of this

316
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:25,605
Speaker 4:  smart mattress and water runs through it from this hub. And

317
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:30,205
Speaker 4:  I am perpetually cold So I like to crank it

318
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:33,965
Speaker 4:  up and it's warm and it's toasty and I fall asleep so quickly.

319
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,725
Speaker 4:  Normally I like tossing and turning. Wait. All

320
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:40,165
Speaker 2:  Right, let's just confession time here on The Vergecast left to your own

321
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,645
Speaker 2:  devices. What's the thermostat at when you're sleeping

322
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:48,045
Speaker 4:  Warm, like in the winter? Minimum 75.

323
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:51,725
Speaker 4:  Wow. Oh my God. I I I need to be

324
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:56,085
Speaker 4:  toasty. I need to be warm. I need a heavy blanket year round.

325
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,405
Speaker 4:  Like I get cold so easily and if I'm cold, I don't fall asleep.

326
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,445
Speaker 4:  So, I need to be toasty.

327
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,965
Speaker 2:  I'm the opposite. I used to get in trouble when I was a kid because I would

328
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:10,365
Speaker 2:  sleep with a window open in like the dead of winter

329
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:14,605
Speaker 2:  because for me it's like cold face, giant blanket.

330
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:18,485
Speaker 2:  That's, that's the life that's where I want to be. But then getting out of

331
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,925
Speaker 2:  bed is awful. These like

332
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:23,805
Speaker 4:  The worst. Yeah, no, no, I, I don't, I don't, I don't mess around with

333
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,725
Speaker 4:  cold stuff. I like to be warm. Toasty, snug is a bug in the fetal

334
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:31,445
Speaker 4:  position. That's me, my, my spouse. However, like this summer,

335
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:35,605
Speaker 4:  like, I think the max cold setting you can go on this bed is negative 10

336
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:39,485
Speaker 4:  and they were just like negative 10. I wanna

337
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,405
Speaker 4:  sleep on a slab of ice. I'm living this penguin life.

338
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:47,485
Speaker 4:  And honestly they can do that on their side of the bed. I can be

339
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:51,485
Speaker 4:  in toasty heaven and they can be in ice cold hell. and we

340
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:52,925
Speaker 4:  can both be super happy about that.

341
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:56,045
Speaker 2:  Wait, but there, there's something interesting in that though because I think

342
00:20:56,585 --> 00:21:00,525
Speaker 2:  on the one hand we have lots of science at this point about like

343
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:03,565
Speaker 2:  optimal temperatures for getting good sleep and things you mentioned like

344
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:08,245
Speaker 2:  the the position your body should be at to not snore, So I can imagine

345
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:12,725
Speaker 2:  in some world that like what this mattress pad ought to do for you is

346
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,365
Speaker 2:  optimize all of it automatically and be like, no, trust me, I un I know what

347
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:19,525
Speaker 2:  is required to get it does. Oh it does do that. Okay. Because I was gonna

348
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:22,805
Speaker 2:  say, giving you a lot of buttons and knobs might actually not be helpful,

349
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:24,885
Speaker 2:  but it will attempt to solve these problems for you.

350
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,805
Speaker 4:  Okay. Yeah. No, it has this AI feature which is locked behind a subscription,

351
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:32,245
Speaker 4:  which is why everyone's like, are you crazy? And yes, actually

352
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,445
Speaker 2:  To be fair, I do think a subscription mattress is just in principle

353
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:40,005
Speaker 2:  ridiculous. Even though I, I sort of understand why it exists. It is in principle,

354
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:40,605
Speaker 2:  it's ridiculous

355
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:45,165
Speaker 4:  In principle, subscribing to your mattress is ludicrous.

356
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:48,445
Speaker 4:  And I think I wrote that in my review. It is absolutely batshit insane,

357
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:52,205
Speaker 4:  ludicrous, but you're not even subscribing to the mattress, you're subscribing

358
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:56,125
Speaker 4:  to the mattress cover. So it's absolutely bonkers,

359
00:21:56,845 --> 00:22:00,525
Speaker 4:  honky tonk insane. But at the same time, I cannot

360
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:04,165
Speaker 4:  lie, I have been sleeping so well. Even when

361
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:08,325
Speaker 4:  external circumstances in this world are crazy, I sleep

362
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:09,965
Speaker 4:  like a baby that's

363
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:13,765
Speaker 2:  So If. you have that mode on it, it will attempt to balance all the temperature

364
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:17,805
Speaker 2:  and, and space and adjustments of the positioning.

365
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,245
Speaker 2:  It'll try to just do all that for you.

366
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:23,085
Speaker 4:  It does all of that for you. And then when you look it up in the app in the

367
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:26,885
Speaker 4:  morning, it's so proud. It's like autopilot made four adjustments last

368
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:30,565
Speaker 4:  night to help you sleep longer. So like I, I look at it and it's like these

369
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:33,965
Speaker 4:  micro adjustments to temperature So I need to be very toasty to fall asleep,

370
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:37,725
Speaker 4:  but to stay asleep, I apparently need to sleep cooler. Mm. So

371
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:41,645
Speaker 4:  it'll do that. It'll adjust during the middle of the night to the temperature

372
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:45,405
Speaker 4:  to help me stay asleep. And the longer you test

373
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:49,285
Speaker 4:  this stuff, the better it gets. And to the point where I'm just like,

374
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:53,205
Speaker 4:  this is a joke. My god. Like all my other corroborating sleep

375
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,125
Speaker 4:  tracker data has basically set my sleep has been

376
00:22:56,635 --> 00:23:00,605
Speaker 4:  spectacular for the last six months. And I am putting on

377
00:23:00,605 --> 00:23:04,445
Speaker 4:  muscle, I am losing fat at, at the same time. It is just, it's,

378
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:08,365
Speaker 4:  I wake up like I wake up at 4:30 AM

379
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:11,805
Speaker 4:  now feeling completely rested because I go to bed at like

380
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:14,485
Speaker 4:  an insane grandpa time, like

381
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:19,095
Speaker 4:  9 39, 9 30 or whatever. And I'm

382
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:22,095
Speaker 4:  out here. I just pop out of bed in the mornings a lot of times just like,

383
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:26,015
Speaker 4:  hi, I'm super rested. Time to go on a run, which I

384
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:29,855
Speaker 4:  never thought was possible for me. It's like I am, I

385
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:33,615
Speaker 4:  have a history of insomnia. I don't fall asleep easily.

386
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:38,175
Speaker 4:  I previously in the past and I have the data to back it up, I have had really

387
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:41,655
Speaker 4:  crappy sleep scores. So it's, it's just

388
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:45,925
Speaker 4:  wild to see that and to feel the improvement in my life and

389
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,725
Speaker 4:  then think this is

390
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:51,325
Speaker 4:  $4,799 and comes with

391
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:55,405
Speaker 4:  a $300 per year subscription or something along those

392
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:59,365
Speaker 4:  lines. So really testing this, my whole thing has just been

393
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:02,765
Speaker 4:  like, how much is a good night's

394
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:06,805
Speaker 4:  sleep worth? How much is the best night's sleep worth to me?

395
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:10,485
Speaker 2:  Well, so let, let's actually separate those questions, right, because I think

396
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:15,005
Speaker 2:  If, you look at the eight sleep thing as kind of the very

397
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:18,685
Speaker 2:  end of a spectrum, right? Which is like, it is, it is doing the most and

398
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:19,965
Speaker 2:  it is charging the most,

399
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:23,725
Speaker 4:  It's actually doing the middle sleep number has like

400
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:27,445
Speaker 4:  $10,000 beds. Do they really? So this being they do, oh my god. So this being

401
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:30,765
Speaker 4:  modular and fitting on your existing mattress is actually kind of like

402
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:34,765
Speaker 4:  mid high spectrum. Okay. If not the, the craziest end of the spectrum.

403
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,725
Speaker 2:  All right. So we'll put that at like a seven out of 10 sleep number. Yeah.

404
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:41,245
Speaker 2:  I can't even fathom with, I don't EI don't wanna know because I can't afford

405
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:44,965
Speaker 2:  it and I don't wanna know. But I'm curious, like I, I remember, I don't even

406
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:47,925
Speaker 2:  know if these are still really a thing, but there was this run of like sleep

407
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:51,405
Speaker 2:  tracking apps and there were the gadgets that would sit on your bedside table

408
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:55,005
Speaker 2:  that would try to do this. And have we gotten anywhere with those? Like are

409
00:24:55,005 --> 00:24:57,085
Speaker 2:  can these approximate some of the stuff you're talking about?

410
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:02,125
Speaker 4:  Some of them can, like I actually really liked the Amazon halo

411
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,965
Speaker 4:  rise, which is rare for me because all of the Amazon Halo products I hated

412
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,165
Speaker 4:  with like a burning passion.

413
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:09,445
Speaker 2:  You and everybody else that turns out,

414
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:13,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah, me and every, that was not special. That was not a hot tank. But that

415
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:17,205
Speaker 4:  I, I liked this bedside lamp that gently woke you up with

416
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:22,445
Speaker 4:  light because that's actually quite effective. I've tested a bunch of these.

417
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:26,605
Speaker 4:  It's really effective to wake up with light. So smart light's

418
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:30,565
Speaker 4:  really great If, you hate alarms, they just come on, you wake up kind of

419
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:33,405
Speaker 4:  naturally. 'cause that's just how circadian rhythms and your brain works.

420
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:38,325
Speaker 4:  I actually liked that. It's sleep tracking. My cat got in

421
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:42,045
Speaker 4:  the way. So, I got a lot of really inaccurate results. So when you have these

422
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:45,885
Speaker 4:  non-invasive, non-invasive in, in the sense that they're not on

423
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:49,685
Speaker 4:  your body in any way on the nightstand, they can be very

424
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:53,685
Speaker 4:  hit or miss. They, they can be great If, you sleep alone,

425
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:58,165
Speaker 4:  don't have pets, don't have a bed partner. That can be

426
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:02,085
Speaker 4:  cool I guess, right? But you know, there this is an option. It's

427
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:05,885
Speaker 4:  there. I've tested the Withing sleep, which is like a little

428
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:09,965
Speaker 4:  mattress that you stick under your mattress. So it's like a little pad that

429
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:11,805
Speaker 4:  you stick under your mattress. Oh right.

430
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:14,765
Speaker 2:  It looks like a little heating pad kind of deal, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah,

431
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:15,245
Speaker 2:  yeah. Okay.

432
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:18,485
Speaker 4:  Super affordable. I think that's a really great budget option. If, you want

433
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:22,365
Speaker 4:  to track your sleep, but you are like, these

434
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:26,125
Speaker 4:  people are crazy. I'm not spending thousands of dollars on this

435
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:29,325
Speaker 4:  mattress that does all of these things and which is totally valid. I think

436
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:32,925
Speaker 4:  you are probably fiscally very responsible if that's your reaction,

437
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:36,165
Speaker 2:  But every morning you wake up feeling a little smug about your decisions.

438
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:40,005
Speaker 4:  I, yeah, I feel so good waking up on this mattress.

439
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,885
Speaker 4:  Let me tell you, I I hate that nobody hates this more than me.

440
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:46,445
Speaker 4:  I hate this the most. For me personally,

441
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:50,285
Speaker 2:  I think this goes on the list of like never try the really expensive thing

442
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:51,325
Speaker 2:  because once you know

443
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:52,765
Speaker 4:  You can't go back,

444
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:55,165
Speaker 2:  It's you can't go back. It's like, it's the recommendation I always give

445
00:26:55,165 --> 00:26:57,685
Speaker 2:  with headphones. Like If, you don't wanna buy a really nice pair of headphones,

446
00:26:57,775 --> 00:27:01,005
Speaker 2:  don't ever try a really nice pair of headphones. Don't 'cause it will ruin

447
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:02,845
Speaker 2:  everything else for you. And I feel like this is the same thing.

448
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:06,525
Speaker 4:  You can't miss what you don't know. A hundred percent. That's a hundred percent

449
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,365
Speaker 4:  it. There's, yeah, so there are

450
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:14,165
Speaker 4:  cheaper versions of those things. I actually think the smart home

451
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:17,925
Speaker 4:  is really great If. you want to just hack it and have stuff that is

452
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:23,125
Speaker 4:  multifunctional. Because the other problem with a lot of the stuff is it's

453
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,845
Speaker 4:  very one, one dimensional, one function. It does one thing.

454
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:30,965
Speaker 4:  Smart lights, you can program them so you can wake up naturally that way.

455
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,925
Speaker 4:  That's great. It can really help with you setting a routine

456
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:39,205
Speaker 4:  smart thermostat. You can, it is not gonna stop your

457
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:42,845
Speaker 4:  marital problems and, and fights over what temperature of the thermostat

458
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:46,765
Speaker 4:  is, but you can schedule it so you know that that can help

459
00:27:46,785 --> 00:27:50,565
Speaker 4:  create a much more inviting sleep environment for you.

460
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:54,565
Speaker 4:  So those, those are all much more affordable hacks that have

461
00:27:54,565 --> 00:27:58,525
Speaker 4:  multifunctional purposes that I personally have used and

462
00:27:58,535 --> 00:27:59,725
Speaker 4:  found to be good.

463
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:05,085
Speaker 4:  Does it beat this expensive bed? No. No it does not.

464
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:08,925
Speaker 4:  But at the same time it is really about what

465
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:13,665
Speaker 4:  is it worth to you and how good

466
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:17,225
Speaker 4:  do you want to feel after your night of sleep. Totally. And you know,

467
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:21,625
Speaker 4:  I, I have sleep problems so it means a lot to me. But If

468
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:25,385
Speaker 4:  you are someone who sleeps like the dead on the crappiest Ikea

469
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:29,545
Speaker 4:  mattress. You don't need this stuff. You're good. You're Gucci, right? Like

470
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:33,385
Speaker 4:  So I it, it is, I I definitely understand the

471
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:37,305
Speaker 4:  criticism and I'm just sitting there alongside you nodding my head

472
00:28:37,305 --> 00:28:41,265
Speaker 4:  and going, yes, yes you are, you are completely correct. I agree with you

473
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:42,745
Speaker 4:  a hundred percent. At the

474
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:45,545
Speaker 2:  Same time though, yeah, if you're listening to this and you are desperately

475
00:28:45,545 --> 00:28:48,805
Speaker 2:  looking for a reason to buy this, here it is.

476
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:52,965
Speaker 2:  This is not like buying a really fancy pair of running shoes

477
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:56,805
Speaker 2:  you might never have. Or like over-investing in workout

478
00:28:56,805 --> 00:29:00,285
Speaker 2:  equipment that you're never gonna use. This'll work. This is like, you just

479
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,325
Speaker 2:  put this on your bed and it will start doing things in the same way that

480
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:07,285
Speaker 2:  sleep has that it's, it's happening anyway. Like

481
00:29:07,465 --> 00:29:10,725
Speaker 2:  adding something like this into the repertoire

482
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:15,325
Speaker 2:  just helps. It's just, it's just gonna help. This is why like the,

483
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:19,445
Speaker 2:  I want the version of this that is like 60% is good and 20% of the

484
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:22,725
Speaker 2:  price because it's like same. That's the one that it's like, just give me

485
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:25,085
Speaker 2:  the magic pillow and everything will be fine. You know what I mean? Like

486
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:25,645
Speaker 2:  that's the dream.

487
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:29,845
Speaker 4:  Oh, speaking of magic pillows, many, many, many years ago I tested

488
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:34,125
Speaker 4:  a smart pillow, which was the most insane thing because it

489
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:38,085
Speaker 4:  had a speaker inside of the pillow. No. So it would track your sleeping

490
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:42,245
Speaker 4:  and your snoring 'cause there's a microphone in there and then it would

491
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:45,925
Speaker 4:  wake you up to your music inside the pillow. It was one of the most

492
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:49,805
Speaker 4:  ridiculous pieces of sleep tech I've ever tested. But yeah,

493
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:53,765
Speaker 4:  another thing I tested was the Oslo Sleep Buds was gonna ask you about that,

494
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:57,285
Speaker 4:  which is the Bose sleep buds resurrected. They had a lot of, a lot of people

495
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:01,165
Speaker 4:  who are fans of those. And it's really great

496
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:05,125
Speaker 4:  If, you have a noisy environment. 'cause that's the one thing that this

497
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:09,125
Speaker 4:  bed can't solve, right? It can't solve If. you live

498
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:12,645
Speaker 4:  in a city and your neighbor upstairs loves to practice

499
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:16,285
Speaker 4:  salsa at 3:00 AM in the morning. Or in my case, if

500
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:20,605
Speaker 4:  Hackensack loves to send garbage trucks outside of your house

501
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,085
Speaker 4:  at exactly 5:00 AM and you're just like, oh,

502
00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:29,045
Speaker 4:  I'm awake now having these buds in your ear,

503
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:34,045
Speaker 4:  can it, it can muffle a lot of the noise. So I. I used to be

504
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:38,285
Speaker 4:  a religious user of that. My, my spouse is a religious user of not the,

505
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:42,285
Speaker 4:  not the PO ones 'cause those once again very expensive or the

506
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:46,285
Speaker 4:  Oslo ones are expensive, but he has the cheaper anchor sound core,

507
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:50,285
Speaker 4:  which allows them to play their true crime podcast, which

508
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:53,805
Speaker 4:  why you wanna go to bed. Listening to murder is a thing I don't necessarily

509
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:57,285
Speaker 4:  understand, but it works for them. So they do that,

510
00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:01,885
Speaker 4:  they love it, it falls out of their ear, which we

511
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:05,845
Speaker 4:  don't love. But the Bose design is very good for side

512
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:09,445
Speaker 4:  sleepers. I don't feel discomfort. They don't fall out of my ear

513
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:13,045
Speaker 4:  pretty great. Okay. Those will apparently come with sleep tracking

514
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:17,125
Speaker 4:  sometime in 2025. So yeah, we're, we're out here, we're sleep

515
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:20,125
Speaker 4:  maxing, we're just sleep maxing and just trying to figure it out.

516
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:24,125
Speaker 2:  The earbuds are one that I have always felt like could be more

517
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:26,805
Speaker 2:  than they are. So I'm, I'm actually encouraged to hear that they're gonna

518
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:29,325
Speaker 2:  do some sleep tracking stuff with it. Because like, one thing you and I have

519
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:32,885
Speaker 2:  heard a lot of over the years is people saying like, the, the ears are a

520
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:36,445
Speaker 2:  really interesting place to do wearables stuff. And especially if you're

521
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:39,885
Speaker 2:  gonna start to think about like, how do I, you know, gently help you go to

522
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:42,685
Speaker 2:  sleep and gently help you wake up. Like that's a thing you can do with a

523
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:46,525
Speaker 2:  thing in your ears. Like, I dunno if it can help you not snore

524
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:49,925
Speaker 2:  or fix the temperature, probably not. But there's like little things

525
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,885
Speaker 2:  that if you're just doing like a tracker you probably can't do.

526
00:31:55,025 --> 00:31:58,485
Speaker 2:  But If, you have this device that is just gonna sit in your ears all night.

527
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:01,885
Speaker 2:  It feels like there's more you could do. So maybe there's, maybe there is

528
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:03,765
Speaker 2:  a roadmap of interesting stuff to come there.

529
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,685
Speaker 4:  Especially for like helping you fall asleep because I think that's

530
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:11,445
Speaker 4:  something that a lot of people have issues with is just falling asleep,

531
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:15,805
Speaker 4:  figuring out ways to fall asleep. So staying asleep,

532
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:20,685
Speaker 4:  it's a, it's a valuable thing because I have tried the smart

533
00:32:20,695 --> 00:32:24,645
Speaker 4:  alarm clocks. I've tried the Hatch Restore that

534
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:28,525
Speaker 4:  TikTok made me try it. It's on my nightstand. And that,

535
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,685
Speaker 4:  you know, just having a sleep partner doesn't really work out well

536
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:36,605
Speaker 4:  for me. Yeah. Like the, the light. Great. Love that. Waking

537
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:37,165
Speaker 4:  up. How

538
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:40,645
Speaker 2:  Does it feel to know that you and my 1-year-old son have the same alarm clock?

539
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:43,725
Speaker 2:  Is that, is that good? Is that cool? He loves, yeah, it works great for him.

540
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:46,245
Speaker 4:  He sleeps like a baby. So honestly,

541
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:52,055
Speaker 4:  honestly, I'm, I'm trying to, I'm trying to live that life, so it

542
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:52,855
Speaker 4:  makes me feel great.

543
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:56,175
Speaker 2:  That's good. All right, before we let you go, any other, any other sleep

544
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,535
Speaker 2:  gadgets on your mind? Anything else you've been looking at or trying or hoping

545
00:32:59,535 --> 00:32:59,935
Speaker 2:  to try?

546
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:05,195
Speaker 4:  Honestly, I'm just going to reiterate one last time that

547
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:09,275
Speaker 4:  you should invest in your sleep in, in whatever way

548
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,315
Speaker 4:  and don't cheap out on it.

549
00:33:13,195 --> 00:33:16,645
Speaker 4:  Sometimes the right decision is to buy a $5,000

550
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:19,525
Speaker 4:  mattress cover. Sometimes that is the right decision.

551
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,525
Speaker 2:  This is where we were gonna land because the verges editorial policies

552
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:27,045
Speaker 2:  dictate that you don't get to keep this thing at some point.

553
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:31,285
Speaker 2:  This beautiful device that has changed your life is going to leave your house.

554
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:33,885
Speaker 2:  What happens then? Can you go back?

555
00:33:34,785 --> 00:33:38,205
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna buy it. Yeah, but I, it's, it's either gonna be a long-term

556
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:42,765
Speaker 4:  sleep testing control device so that I can test it for sleep trackers,

557
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:43,325
Speaker 4:  right?

558
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:44,805
Speaker 2:  For journalism, everyone,

559
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:48,805
Speaker 4:  For journalism purpose, for journalism, for journalism purposes, or

560
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:53,085
Speaker 4:  you know, just have to buy the thing because I can't go

561
00:33:53,085 --> 00:33:56,925
Speaker 4:  back and you know, like if it was just a simple matter of

562
00:33:56,955 --> 00:34:00,365
Speaker 4:  also returning it and knowing that that's what it was gonna be, that'd be

563
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:04,205
Speaker 4:  cool. But because this has my biological material

564
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:08,125
Speaker 4:  on it, they will not necessarily return it. Right. They will destroy it.

565
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,485
Speaker 4:  And then that just feels like e-waste. So

566
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:15,665
Speaker 4:  I'll figure out a way, I'll figure out financing.

567
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:20,185
Speaker 4:  I will do long-term test tracking. But this is one of the things

568
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,985
Speaker 4:  where, yeah, I'm just gonna have to buy it honestly,

569
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:27,425
Speaker 4:  if it comes, comes down to it. And that's just,

570
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:31,915
Speaker 4:  it has a huge impact on my life. Yeah. My, my sleep quality is so much better.

571
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:36,075
Speaker 4:  You can think I'm crazy. All you like, I'll figure it out.

572
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:39,795
Speaker 4:  I I'll figure it out. My husband does not agree with me, but I'll figure

573
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:40,115
Speaker 4:  it out.

574
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:41,875
Speaker 2:  So that's their problem, not

575
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:45,595
Speaker 4:  Yours. That's their problem, not mine. I will be figuring this out and I

576
00:34:45,595 --> 00:34:48,315
Speaker 4:  will be paying a absurd subscription. So

577
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:52,195
Speaker 2:  That's how they get, you don't test it unless you're willing to buy it. People,

578
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:52,635
Speaker 2:  I'm

579
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:55,675
Speaker 4:  Not, those are the rules proud of my life choices, but they are mine.

580
00:34:55,965 --> 00:34:59,555
Speaker 2:  These are the things we do for our audience. V we spend outrageous amounts

581
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,195
Speaker 2:  of money on beautiful nights of sleep.

582
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:05,715
Speaker 4:  You know, I'm winning. So there you go.

583
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:08,515
Speaker 2:  All right v thank you as always.

584
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:10,195
Speaker 4:  Thanks for having me.

585
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:14,275
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna

586
00:35:14,275 --> 00:35:15,835
Speaker 2:  talk about music. We'll be right back.

587
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:33,745
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back If. you use Spotify, I'm sure you know

588
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:37,705
Speaker 2:  the DJ feature. You click on it, it has this AI

589
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:41,505
Speaker 2:  generated voice that greets you and then it plays you music. And

590
00:36:41,505 --> 00:36:45,065
Speaker 2:  that's the idea. It is supposed to be a, a sort of constantly updated

591
00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:49,065
Speaker 2:  AI curated playlist of music that you'd like.

592
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:53,745
Speaker 2:  I love this feature. I listen to it all the time. I think the voice bit

593
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:57,645
Speaker 2:  is kind of weird, but I think the idea that I can just

594
00:36:57,645 --> 00:37:01,325
Speaker 2:  sit down and essentially press play and have something play music for me

595
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:04,965
Speaker 2:  that I'm going to like, is very powerful. Alison Johnson

596
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:08,605
Speaker 2:  on our team feels slightly differently. She has also been testing

597
00:37:09,305 --> 00:37:13,125
Speaker 2:  ai, DJ stuff, has a lot of thoughts and I figured

598
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:16,885
Speaker 2:  it, it, we just need to hash this out. I'm also working on a big story about

599
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:20,925
Speaker 2:  what the best music app is because I'm sort of over Spotify and

600
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:24,125
Speaker 2:  trying to find something else and finding something else is a challenge.

601
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:28,125
Speaker 2:  So I'm hoping Allison can help me talk through this one piece of it

602
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:32,245
Speaker 2:  and try to make sense of things. Let's just get into it. Alison, hello.

603
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:33,125
Speaker 5:  Hello.

604
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:36,725
Speaker 2:  I should tell everybody that I'm interrupting a day off for you to do this

605
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:40,805
Speaker 2:  So I and everyone listening owe you a great debt of gratitude.

606
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:45,445
Speaker 5:  I'm happy to be here. I get to talk to another adult before a

607
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:48,045
Speaker 5:  little bit before I go to the Children's Museum. So

608
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:52,515
Speaker 2:  This is, I'm I'm happy to, I'm happy to do it. So real

609
00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:56,315
Speaker 2:  quick, I wanna talk about AI DJs But. first, I want know kind of

610
00:37:56,465 --> 00:38:00,395
Speaker 2:  your theory of the case about Spotify's AI

611
00:38:00,415 --> 00:38:03,675
Speaker 2:  DJ in particular. This is very clearly a thing you have been thinking about

612
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:07,395
Speaker 2:  a lot and there's a lot of interesting context, but you've, you've come to

613
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,475
Speaker 2:  a conclusion about these things and I wanna know what that is.

614
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:13,475
Speaker 5:  Yeah, so Spotify, like every other

615
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:17,515
Speaker 5:  tech company with an app has been shoving

616
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,395
Speaker 5:  AI into everything over the past year. And

617
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:25,915
Speaker 5:  the one that caught my eye recently is this AI dj, which is

618
00:38:26,295 --> 00:38:30,235
Speaker 5:  not actually new, it's been around like a year, but it just kind of

619
00:38:30,235 --> 00:38:33,715
Speaker 5:  popped up in my feed and I was like, sure, I'll try this

620
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:37,765
Speaker 5:  weird thing. And, and right outta the gate, it's just so strange.

621
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:40,605
Speaker 5:  'cause it, it talks to you, it goes, Hey Allison,

622
00:38:41,795 --> 00:38:45,245
Speaker 5:  blah, blah, blah. They kinda launch into a like DJ

623
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:47,285
Speaker 5:  spiel about what they're gonna play

624
00:38:48,985 --> 00:38:52,845
Speaker 5:  and then, you know, it gets into the music and not surprisingly

625
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:56,885
Speaker 5:  in any way, it's all stuff that I really like

626
00:38:57,115 --> 00:39:01,045
Speaker 5:  because what company has more data about what

627
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,565
Speaker 5:  music I like to listen to than Spotify. Yeah.

628
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:08,605
Speaker 5:  I was just kinda like, what is this? And I try, I listened to it, I like

629
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:12,525
Speaker 5:  kept with it for a day and like off

630
00:39:12,525 --> 00:39:16,365
Speaker 5:  and on throughout a week just to be like, what is going on

631
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:16,605
Speaker 5:  here?

632
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:21,485
Speaker 2:  But you don't like that you just described such a good thing what you just,

633
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,845
Speaker 2:  and this, this is why I think this is so interesting and why I wanna talk

634
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:26,765
Speaker 2:  about it, what you just said. I just, I'm just gonna say it back to you is

635
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:31,245
Speaker 2:  you, you clicked on a thing that greeted you by name and then played a bunch

636
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:34,405
Speaker 2:  of music in a row that you really like and this feels like a problem.

637
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:38,805
Speaker 5:  Terrible. Yeah, no. So here here's the thing,

638
00:39:40,475 --> 00:39:44,205
Speaker 5:  kind of the, the flip side is that we have a local radio

639
00:39:44,205 --> 00:39:47,845
Speaker 5:  station in Seattle, K-K-E-X-P that

640
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:51,325
Speaker 5:  I've, I've listened to forever, since before I moved to Seattle.

641
00:39:52,665 --> 00:39:56,445
Speaker 5:  And it's just kind of like a daily habit. It's on

642
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:59,525
Speaker 5:  in the background all the time. It's on in the car. And

643
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:04,245
Speaker 5:  I don't know if it's a Seattle thing or a me thing or what it is, but

644
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:07,925
Speaker 5:  the osmosis of like, you, you get, you have these like

645
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:11,605
Speaker 5:  parasocial relationships with the DJs that kind of start you like

646
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:15,565
Speaker 5:  have your favorite DJs. And then the weird thing in Seattle is like,

647
00:40:15,595 --> 00:40:19,325
Speaker 5:  I'll be out on the bike path and I'll see Kevin Cole going

648
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:23,165
Speaker 5:  the other direction after his show. I'm like, oh, they're, they're real

649
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:26,445
Speaker 5:  humans. They're out here just like we are.

650
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:30,525
Speaker 2:  And I feel like in, in Seattle, like a very musicy town that counts as like

651
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:33,005
Speaker 2:  an actual celebrity setting. Like that's, that's legit.

652
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:36,045
Speaker 5:  Oh, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. The whole rest of my bike ride, I was like, oh

653
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:37,845
Speaker 5:  my God, Kevin Gold was going on the bike.

654
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:43,245
Speaker 5:  So that's, that's kind of like the background where I,

655
00:40:43,415 --> 00:40:46,685
Speaker 5:  maybe I bring a little more skepticism to it where I'm like,

656
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:51,045
Speaker 5:  you know, I, to me a a radio DJ is like

657
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:55,245
Speaker 5:  a real person and I have favorite radio DJs

658
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:59,365
Speaker 5:  and yeah, hearing, hearing this, which is just an

659
00:40:59,365 --> 00:41:03,245
Speaker 5:  imitation of that, just like maybe I

660
00:41:03,245 --> 00:41:06,125
Speaker 5:  was just not gonna like it right out of the gate. But

661
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:09,245
Speaker 5:  that's my bias I brought to it, I guess.

662
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:13,685
Speaker 2:  So I, this is part of why I wanted to talk about this because I think

663
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:17,885
Speaker 2:  trying to figure out what feels wrong about the AI

664
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:21,725
Speaker 2:  DJ actually feels like a really useful sort of metaphor for all

665
00:41:21,725 --> 00:41:25,005
Speaker 2:  of ai. And I think this is a lot of what you were getting at in this piece.

666
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:28,885
Speaker 2:  And I think why it struck me too, there's this question of, okay, is it

667
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:33,485
Speaker 2:  a bad thing that it is pretty much exclusively playing music? I

668
00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:37,165
Speaker 2:  definitely for sure am going to like, like for me, I was listening to my

669
00:41:37,165 --> 00:41:40,765
Speaker 2:  DJ all morning and I mean, it is just down the middle

670
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:45,205
Speaker 2:  David Bait, right? Yeah. One of it was like, there, there was this guy I

671
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:49,085
Speaker 2:  found who was doing like punk rock covers of old songs on

672
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:52,045
Speaker 2:  TikTok. And then I listened to a bunch of his stuff on Spotify and it was

673
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:54,605
Speaker 2:  just like, what if we just played nine of his songs in a row? I was like,

674
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:58,045
Speaker 2:  great, I'm in, let's do it. Yeah, Let's go. And then, and then there was

675
00:41:58,045 --> 00:42:01,845
Speaker 2:  a bunch of like Cynthia eighties pop

676
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:05,725
Speaker 2:  music, which Spotify like you said, has immense knowledge of the

677
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:09,365
Speaker 2:  fact that that is music I'm always gonna like, and so it, it was like

678
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:12,685
Speaker 2:  a no skips playlist for an hour and a half and I got to the end and I was

679
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:15,765
Speaker 2:  like, was did I, did I get anything out of any of that? Like could I tell

680
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:18,725
Speaker 2:  you what songs it played? It was just sort of music. So there's the question

681
00:42:18,725 --> 00:42:22,205
Speaker 2:  of like, is that the right thing? And then there's the question of like,

682
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:26,085
Speaker 2:  is this, is this product even a good idea? And that goes back to

683
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:30,045
Speaker 2:  the, like, it's a, it's a person quote unquote talking

684
00:42:30,145 --> 00:42:34,125
Speaker 2:  to you, quote unquote as it goes. And there, there is

685
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:37,925
Speaker 2:  this thing about this, this thing is obviously trying to

686
00:42:38,435 --> 00:42:42,325
Speaker 2:  seem like a person. And I think one of the things we're seeing about AI

687
00:42:42,405 --> 00:42:46,325
Speaker 2:  a lot is AI that is trying to seem like a person. And, and I

688
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:49,885
Speaker 2:  think in some ways this is just the most sort of n

689
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:54,085
Speaker 2:  nakedly straightforward version of that. And it rubs

690
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:56,725
Speaker 2:  me the wrong way too. And I can't figure out if it's just because it's not

691
00:42:56,725 --> 00:42:59,485
Speaker 2:  very good or if it's because it's the wrong idea.

692
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:03,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's, I mean, it's pretty convincing. Like, it,

693
00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:06,925
Speaker 5:  it just sounds like a person talking to you.

694
00:43:08,265 --> 00:43:12,045
Speaker 5:  And I think, like I, to me it just

695
00:43:12,045 --> 00:43:15,965
Speaker 5:  feels like this is not somewhere I need ai. Like

696
00:43:16,165 --> 00:43:19,765
Speaker 5:  I am good with Spotify putting together a playlist for me.

697
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:23,605
Speaker 5:  You know, I use the playlist feature, the AI

698
00:43:24,005 --> 00:43:27,765
Speaker 5:  playlist feature quite a bit where I'm like, I wanna hear

699
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:31,845
Speaker 5:  upbeat jazz. There can't be any lyrics because I'm writing

700
00:43:31,965 --> 00:43:35,325
Speaker 5:  a blog, you know? And like it spits out a playlist and it's great.

701
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,485
Speaker 2:  Which is also AI by the way. Yeah.

702
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:37,725
Speaker 5:  That is,

703
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:41,245
Speaker 2:  It's, it's a different flavor of it that is still very much ai

704
00:43:41,545 --> 00:43:45,365
Speaker 5:  And, and I'm totally good with that. I am like, do not

705
00:43:45,705 --> 00:43:49,565
Speaker 5:  try to insert a human into this interaction, you know? Right.

706
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:53,565
Speaker 5:  It's, it's a very like, transactional, like this is fine.

707
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:58,445
Speaker 5:  So that's where, where I think I am just weirded out by the DJs.

708
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:02,245
Speaker 5:  Like we have human DJs, we have people

709
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:06,525
Speaker 5:  If, you wanna listen to the radio, you can do that. Like why, who

710
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:10,245
Speaker 5:  is asking for this? It feels, I put it in the box of who was asking for this.

711
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:15,325
Speaker 2:  No, I I think that's totally right. And I think I made a lot of fun of Apple

712
00:44:15,325 --> 00:44:19,125
Speaker 2:  music when Apple Music came out and they had, you know, beats won and

713
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,885
Speaker 2:  all of these celebrity driven radio stations

714
00:44:22,885 --> 00:44:26,805
Speaker 2:  essentially is like, and and my theory then was like, who

715
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:30,765
Speaker 2:  wants this? Right? Like in a, I have a library full of

716
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:34,925
Speaker 2:  infinite music, why am I gonna spend two

717
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:38,325
Speaker 2:  hours a week listening to like whatever John Mayer feels like playing?

718
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:43,525
Speaker 2:  I was wrong about that for, I think exactly the reason

719
00:44:43,545 --> 00:44:47,205
Speaker 2:  you're describing that there is a lot of time

720
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:51,265
Speaker 2:  that I just want what I want. Right.

721
00:44:51,265 --> 00:44:54,545
Speaker 2:  Which is like a giant library full of music and I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna

722
00:44:54,545 --> 00:44:57,465
Speaker 2:  be like, I would like to listen to the Wicked soundtrack, please. Yeah, go

723
00:44:57,465 --> 00:45:00,505
Speaker 2:  listen to the Wicked soundtrack. Great. Right. That, that is better than

724
00:45:00,505 --> 00:45:04,465
Speaker 2:  the radio. And then there's all the way on the other side there is the like,

725
00:45:04,655 --> 00:45:08,545
Speaker 2:  just expand my brain a little bit. Right?

726
00:45:08,545 --> 00:45:12,145
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I think that AI is not doing

727
00:45:12,145 --> 00:45:15,785
Speaker 2:  successfully at all. Yeah. And, and, and this goes back to the like, is it

728
00:45:15,785 --> 00:45:19,025
Speaker 2:  right to just play me songs that I like a bunch of times in a row? I think

729
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:23,625
Speaker 2:  that that is such an easy win if your goal is to just get people

730
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:27,545
Speaker 2:  to keep listening, but it doesn't feel good. Yeah.

731
00:45:27,545 --> 00:45:30,025
Speaker 2:  Like in, in a way that, like you, you, you talked about, you know, some of

732
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:33,905
Speaker 2:  the stuff you've gotten from KEX exp as like meaningful stuff and you

733
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:36,865
Speaker 2:  like remember the experience and it feels cool and you feel like part of

734
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:39,905
Speaker 2:  community. I don't think it's possible to get any of that from this AI stuff.

735
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:43,745
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's exactly it. And the, the

736
00:45:44,545 --> 00:45:48,465
Speaker 5:  metaphor I landed on is like, listening to Kxp

737
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:52,185
Speaker 5:  is sort of like a well-rounded meal. Like there's stuff I really like,

738
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:56,345
Speaker 5:  there's stuff I am sort of into, there's stuff I, I just straight

739
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:59,305
Speaker 5:  up do not like, but it's, it feels like

740
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:04,465
Speaker 5:  a balanced experience. And the AI DJ is

741
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:08,185
Speaker 5:  just straight up feeding me like all this stuff I like, I'm like,

742
00:46:08,985 --> 00:46:12,545
Speaker 5:  I love M and mss. I don't want to eat m and MSS all day long. You know, like,

743
00:46:12,545 --> 00:46:16,305
Speaker 5:  like you, you get a stomach ache eventually that,

744
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:19,785
Speaker 5:  and that's just kind of how it feels to me. And there is like, yeah,

745
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:23,545
Speaker 5:  it, it just, it hits different, there's like, I hear

746
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:28,825
Speaker 5:  tears for fears come on in the grocery store and I'm like,

747
00:46:28,935 --> 00:46:32,665
Speaker 5:  well they know that a woman in her late thirties

748
00:46:32,805 --> 00:46:36,265
Speaker 5:  is probably shopping is gonna love this and they're right.

749
00:46:36,845 --> 00:46:40,745
Speaker 5:  But then my, you know, favorite DJ plays it on KXP

750
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:45,425
Speaker 5:  'cause she really loves it. I'm like, oh, this is, it just, it, it's

751
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:46,505
Speaker 5:  more meaningful I think.

752
00:46:47,495 --> 00:46:51,425
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The one part of it I have trouble with is the, is

753
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:55,425
Speaker 2:  it good to play me stuff that I hate side of things. Right. Because I

754
00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:57,625
Speaker 2:  think, and you made this case a little bit in your piece and I think it,

755
00:46:57,695 --> 00:47:01,385
Speaker 2:  it's been a thing for you of like the, the percentage of

756
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:05,305
Speaker 2:  things that I hear from these DJs or whatever that I actively don't like

757
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:09,865
Speaker 2:  is good and important and yeah, there's part of me that sort of intellectually

758
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:13,065
Speaker 2:  understands that, but then part of me that's like, well a,

759
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:17,305
Speaker 2:  that's the time when I turn off the radio. Right? Yeah.

760
00:47:17,845 --> 00:47:18,065
Speaker 5:  Or,

761
00:47:18,645 --> 00:47:22,465
Speaker 2:  Or b what if it just only played things that

762
00:47:22,545 --> 00:47:26,345
Speaker 2:  I liked and then I'm back to the a i DJ thing that it's like, again,

763
00:47:26,345 --> 00:47:29,105
Speaker 2:  you can see how you get there, right? Where it's like if we just keep playing

764
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,765
Speaker 2:  songs that you like, you're, you, you won't turn the thing off.

765
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,885
Speaker 2:  And so what responsibility does it have to

766
00:47:36,995 --> 00:47:40,565
Speaker 2:  just inject randomness into your life

767
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:44,845
Speaker 2:  in even on the grand likelihood that you're gonna hate it. And

768
00:47:44,985 --> 00:47:48,525
Speaker 2:  in a weird way, I feel like this is something we're not dealing with at all

769
00:47:49,305 --> 00:47:52,325
Speaker 2:  in the rest of ai, but it's the kind of question we're gonna have to have

770
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:56,205
Speaker 2:  all the time when we get to things like all of these sort of information

771
00:47:56,445 --> 00:47:59,285
Speaker 2:  retrieval services and the way that we think about generating images and

772
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:02,925
Speaker 2:  texts. Like should it write you a bad email one out of 10 times just to like

773
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:04,885
Speaker 2:  keep you on your, just to feel

774
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,165
Speaker 5:  I don't wear reel. Yeah. Yeah. There's a weird like

775
00:48:09,325 --> 00:48:13,245
Speaker 5:  personalization echo chamber I think that you can get into

776
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:17,775
Speaker 5:  and it's, I don't know, maybe like, there's times

777
00:48:17,885 --> 00:48:21,615
Speaker 5:  when I'm like, yeah, I wanna be in the echo chamber of music. I like,

778
00:48:21,895 --> 00:48:25,695
Speaker 5:  I don't feel like, you know, eating my

779
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:28,975
Speaker 5:  vegetables today, I just wanna hear the stuff I like.

780
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:34,255
Speaker 5:  But I think it's like, that's probably different for every person and I think

781
00:48:34,255 --> 00:48:38,135
Speaker 5:  there's a different limit of like, when do I feel like, okay,

782
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:42,055
Speaker 5:  I've, I should probably listen to something else and like

783
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:46,095
Speaker 5:  get, get something else mixed in here and then I don't

784
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:49,855
Speaker 5:  know, then when I go back to listening to washed out or whatever I'm doing,

785
00:48:50,085 --> 00:48:53,575
Speaker 5:  it's like, it sounds great. I'm like, yeah, I I love this.

786
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:58,015
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I I like the m and m's analogy a lot, right? It's like, it's good to

787
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:01,695
Speaker 2:  have comfort food. Yeah. But If you only eat comfort food. Like comfort food

788
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:04,775
Speaker 2:  is comfort food because you don't eat it all the time. That is kind of the

789
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,575
Speaker 2:  point. Right,

790
00:49:05,765 --> 00:49:07,015
Speaker 5:  Exactly. Yeah.

791
00:49:07,555 --> 00:49:11,175
Speaker 2:  Do you think that's something AI can get better at? Like is there someone

792
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:14,055
Speaker 2:  at Spotify who can tweak that algorithm to make that work?

793
00:49:14,935 --> 00:49:18,895
Speaker 5:  I think it, I mean it probably could, but some, you know,

794
00:49:18,895 --> 00:49:22,775
Speaker 5:  someone commented on the article and it

795
00:49:22,775 --> 00:49:26,335
Speaker 5:  really resonated with me that when a human plays

796
00:49:26,335 --> 00:49:30,295
Speaker 5:  something that you don't like, they like it, like they have

797
00:49:30,575 --> 00:49:34,455
Speaker 5:  a reason for playing it and you kind of like weigh it differently in

798
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:37,775
Speaker 5:  your head and you kind of give it a chance maybe more than, than if this

799
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:42,095
Speaker 5:  robot, like, I'm, I'm like more offended when the robot plays something I

800
00:49:42,095 --> 00:49:46,015
Speaker 5:  don't like, I'm like, excuse me, where

801
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:47,055
Speaker 5:  did you come up with this?

802
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:51,015
Speaker 2:  That's so true. Yeah. Well and there's a sense of like, you, the robot

803
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:55,175
Speaker 2:  should know. Yeah, yeah. Right. Like you, you dumb ass Spotify

804
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:59,335
Speaker 2:  dj. Yeah. You know everything about what I like, why are you

805
00:49:59,335 --> 00:49:59,735
Speaker 2:  playing me

806
00:49:59,735 --> 00:50:03,575
Speaker 5:  This? Yeah. Get out of here with this. It tried to do that. There was, I

807
00:50:03,575 --> 00:50:07,335
Speaker 5:  turned it on the other day and it was like, here are some songs that are

808
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:11,135
Speaker 5:  shaping rock music right now. And I was like, absolutely not.

809
00:50:11,435 --> 00:50:15,015
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm good. Just, just play the stuff I wanna hear.

810
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:20,495
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it is, I don't know, again, I keep coming back to this question of

811
00:50:20,495 --> 00:50:24,455
Speaker 2:  like, can we can better AI get closer to

812
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:27,565
Speaker 2:  these things? I think I'm just so stuck on this question of like what is

813
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:32,365
Speaker 2:  necessary for humans to do and, and I

814
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:36,325
Speaker 2:  think that the point our comments was making about having someone say

815
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:40,085
Speaker 2:  that they like this to you is really powerful. I mean, we talk to people

816
00:50:40,085 --> 00:50:43,925
Speaker 2:  all the time about like recommendation systems and, and like we,

817
00:50:43,925 --> 00:50:47,045
Speaker 2:  we think about this with like buying guides and all this stuff, right? Like

818
00:50:47,355 --> 00:50:51,165
Speaker 2:  someone you trust liking something is an incredibly

819
00:50:51,235 --> 00:50:54,445
Speaker 2:  good predictor of whether you're going to like that thing because you're

820
00:50:54,445 --> 00:50:57,005
Speaker 2:  more likely to like that thing because you like the person who recommended

821
00:50:57,005 --> 00:51:00,885
Speaker 2:  it. Like there there is some wild human nature thing

822
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:05,005
Speaker 2:  inside of that that I think you just can't replicate with a computer.

823
00:51:05,465 --> 00:51:09,045
Speaker 2:  And it's true of like the Netflix algorithm and everything else, right? Even

824
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:12,925
Speaker 2:  if it puts the perfect thing at the top, I'm still probably

825
00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:15,925
Speaker 2:  more likely to like the thing that you told me to watch than the thing that

826
00:51:15,925 --> 00:51:19,085
Speaker 2:  Netflix told me to watch. Even if statistically Netflix is right. You know

827
00:51:19,085 --> 00:51:22,805
Speaker 2:  what I mean? Yeah. And So I, I wonder to some extent

828
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:26,845
Speaker 2:  if it's a matter of Spotify and everyone else doing this

829
00:51:26,845 --> 00:51:30,725
Speaker 2:  kind of thing, just totally barking up the wrong tree. Or if it's like,

830
00:51:31,095 --> 00:51:35,045
Speaker 2:  maybe if the voice was 10% more convincing, I wouldn't even

831
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:38,285
Speaker 2:  know. Yeah. And it would start to feel like a person. I feel

832
00:51:38,285 --> 00:51:42,045
Speaker 5:  Like there's a, you feel the intention behind it

833
00:51:42,285 --> 00:51:45,525
Speaker 5:  a little bit. Like when I hear something on the radio,

834
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:49,965
Speaker 5:  it's maybe something I don't like, like the there's a person playing it,

835
00:51:50,075 --> 00:51:54,005
Speaker 5:  it's their job to curate music and, and they

836
00:51:54,005 --> 00:51:57,525
Speaker 5:  like it. The intention behind the Spotify

837
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:02,925
Speaker 5:  ai DJ is a little murkier where it's like, I think

838
00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:06,845
Speaker 5:  you just want me to keep using Spotify. You know? Yeah.

839
00:52:06,985 --> 00:52:10,765
Speaker 5:  Or it's like, I, I just can't shake that feeling of like, this is

840
00:52:10,885 --> 00:52:14,805
Speaker 5:  a, this a robot, it's a convincing robot. You are

841
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:18,965
Speaker 5:  basically like the voice of, I don't know, a corporate

842
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:22,885
Speaker 5:  entity like that. Like that's not at the front of my

843
00:52:22,885 --> 00:52:26,365
Speaker 5:  mind when I'm listening to it, but I think it's somewhere in the back where

844
00:52:26,425 --> 00:52:29,805
Speaker 5:  I'm sort of like, I don't quite trust the

845
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:33,725
Speaker 5:  intentions, like when it's trying to introduce me to, but whatever's coming

846
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:37,645
Speaker 5:  next in rock music, I'm like, well, are they

847
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:40,845
Speaker 5:  sponsored or are they just like,

848
00:52:42,145 --> 00:52:45,525
Speaker 5:  did a human pick these? Like, I, I just don't know where it's coming from.

849
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,445
Speaker 5:  It, it feels a little, yeah, it feels murkier, I think.

850
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:52,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then ironically, I think there are probably similar questions worth

851
00:52:52,285 --> 00:52:56,245
Speaker 2:  asking about a lot of radio DJs. True. But it, it feels different

852
00:52:56,275 --> 00:53:00,125
Speaker 2:  even when it's not Right. And I think that that thing is really

853
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:04,085
Speaker 2:  important. And like for Spotify, I think If, you rewind a bunch

854
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:07,805
Speaker 2:  of years. Spotify and everybody else always talked about we

855
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:11,685
Speaker 2:  need this sort of human computer combo to do this stuff

856
00:53:11,685 --> 00:53:15,365
Speaker 2:  really well. And I think my experience at least was,

857
00:53:15,655 --> 00:53:19,525
Speaker 2:  there was a long time where Spotify's curated playlists were

858
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:23,445
Speaker 2:  where I did the vast majority of my listing. Oh yeah. And it was, it

859
00:53:23,445 --> 00:53:27,325
Speaker 2:  was a mix of like, you know, rap Caviar was like the biggest playlist

860
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:31,085
Speaker 2:  on Planet Earth, and it was, it was a person, they had a ton of machine help.

861
00:53:31,235 --> 00:53:34,805
Speaker 2:  They get all kinds of listening data. They get all kinds of like, you know,

862
00:53:34,805 --> 00:53:38,765
Speaker 2:  quantitative and qualitative data about the songs themselves. And, but ultimately

863
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:41,645
Speaker 2:  they're putting the thing together. And I feel like

864
00:53:42,535 --> 00:53:46,425
Speaker 2:  Spotify probably most of all, but to some extent kind of all of these

865
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:50,625
Speaker 2:  media services of any kind have just leaned further and further and further

866
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:54,825
Speaker 2:  into the machine. And maybe the

867
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:58,785
Speaker 2:  right answer is just like a human face on the machine. Like Right.

868
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:03,105
Speaker 2:  The cynical answer is they hire a DJ to just say the

869
00:54:03,105 --> 00:54:06,225
Speaker 2:  words to you instead of Yeah. A machine saying the words to you.

870
00:54:06,885 --> 00:54:10,745
Speaker 2:  But it, it does feel like that combination is

871
00:54:10,745 --> 00:54:13,665
Speaker 2:  being lost. And I think part of the reason I wanted to talk to you about

872
00:54:13,665 --> 00:54:16,905
Speaker 2:  this is, I, I'm curious about your own music habits, because I was thinking

873
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:20,865
Speaker 2:  about my own after reading your story, and I spend a shocking amount of my

874
00:54:20,865 --> 00:54:24,545
Speaker 2:  time in the, like, daily mixes that Spotify

875
00:54:24,615 --> 00:54:28,505
Speaker 2:  does. It has like six of them. One of mine is always country. One of mine

876
00:54:28,725 --> 00:54:31,945
Speaker 2:  is always like movie soundtracks, which is awesome. 'cause that's why I listen

877
00:54:31,945 --> 00:54:35,745
Speaker 2:  during work all day. Like it rips, it's great. But I spend a lot of time

878
00:54:35,745 --> 00:54:39,665
Speaker 2:  in those. And that's ai. There's no person involved in that. That is the

879
00:54:39,945 --> 00:54:43,865
Speaker 2:  computer curating music for me. But that's not like I get to

880
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:46,825
Speaker 2:  the end of those playlists and I couldn't tell you anything about them. They're

881
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,585
Speaker 2:  just kind of the noise I have on during the day. Yeah. And

882
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:54,385
Speaker 2:  reading your article, I was like, oh, I need to go back to listening to the

883
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:57,985
Speaker 2:  radio in the car just as like a new kind of sensory

884
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:01,905
Speaker 2:  experience for music because I had all, all music is background noise

885
00:55:01,905 --> 00:55:04,945
Speaker 2:  to me now in a way that I kind of hate. And I think Spotify has done that

886
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:05,145
Speaker 2:  to me.

887
00:55:05,695 --> 00:55:09,545
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. That's, it's funny because like, I feel like that's a big

888
00:55:09,545 --> 00:55:13,145
Speaker 5:  reason why we all signed up for Spotify was like,

889
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:17,705
Speaker 5:  whoa, the algorithm is really good and you're gonna find stuff that

890
00:55:17,925 --> 00:55:21,545
Speaker 5:  you actually like. And that was like kind of a, in a

891
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:25,665
Speaker 5:  groundbreaking concept at the time. And I, I do

892
00:55:25,665 --> 00:55:29,585
Speaker 5:  find a lot of music I like through recommended stuff on Spotify,

893
00:55:31,365 --> 00:55:35,345
Speaker 5:  but yeah, it is, it is a different, like, you, you do get

894
00:55:35,455 --> 00:55:35,745
Speaker 5:  into

895
00:55:37,265 --> 00:55:41,085
Speaker 5:  the too many m and ms situation, or at least I do pretty

896
00:55:41,085 --> 00:55:45,045
Speaker 5:  quickly because I will just happily keep

897
00:55:45,045 --> 00:55:48,445
Speaker 5:  listening to my Yeah. Eighties inspired

898
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:52,445
Speaker 5:  since pop like bands. And then,

899
00:55:54,075 --> 00:55:57,845
Speaker 5:  yeah, it, it, it feels good to like, there, there's a couple of

900
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:02,725
Speaker 5:  DJs I I like a lot on KXP and I think one,

901
00:56:03,225 --> 00:56:07,125
Speaker 5:  one of the things they do is play the songs that I didn't

902
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:11,045
Speaker 5:  realize I wanted to hear, and they feel kind of out of left field.

903
00:56:11,145 --> 00:56:15,005
Speaker 5:  And there's like, love the Spotify algorithm

904
00:56:15,145 --> 00:56:19,045
Speaker 5:  for what it does, but then I do want it, it's

905
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:22,365
Speaker 5:  like gratifying when I hear something, I'm like, I had no idea

906
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:26,525
Speaker 5:  that I needed to hear Stevie Wonder like as much

907
00:56:26,545 --> 00:56:30,285
Speaker 5:  as I did. And, and you hear it on the radio, it's like, that was perfect.

908
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:34,325
Speaker 5:  I, I feel like it just, it just comes down to feeling like

909
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:39,045
Speaker 5:  there is something there with ai and there Spotify's had a

910
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:43,005
Speaker 5:  lot of success with it. I think they're kind of leaning

911
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:46,485
Speaker 5:  into that, is getting to a point of like,

912
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:51,125
Speaker 5:  well, yeah, the AI was good, but I didn't wanna like talk

913
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:54,885
Speaker 5:  to the ai. Like, it wasn't the AI that I was here for.

914
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:59,085
Speaker 5:  I was here because the AI was helping me get to good music

915
00:56:59,195 --> 00:57:03,125
Speaker 5:  that I like. It's not the entity I wanna be

916
00:57:04,085 --> 00:57:07,805
Speaker 5:  interacting with. And I don't, it's, it's like such a cringey moment

917
00:57:07,805 --> 00:57:11,605
Speaker 5:  right now where everybody's like, you know, you log on Instagram,

918
00:57:11,755 --> 00:57:14,925
Speaker 5:  it's like, do you wanna interact with ai? And I'm like,

919
00:57:15,585 --> 00:57:17,565
Speaker 5:  no. I wanna see what my friends are doing.

920
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:22,005
Speaker 2:  I know, I, I have come to the point where I'm like, I think we, we need to

921
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:25,885
Speaker 2:  get to the point where we think of ai. Like we think of, you know, TCP

922
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:29,965
Speaker 2:  ip, like crucial infrastructure to how all of this

923
00:57:29,965 --> 00:57:32,765
Speaker 2:  works. And if it works correctly, you should never, ever, for one second

924
00:57:32,765 --> 00:57:36,525
Speaker 2:  have to think about it. Right. Like, yeah. I, I don't, I don't spend

925
00:57:36,845 --> 00:57:40,685
Speaker 2:  time thinking about packet loss on the internet anymore because it works

926
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:44,405
Speaker 2:  now. Yeah. But that's not the point of any of it. All of it enables other

927
00:57:44,405 --> 00:57:48,165
Speaker 2:  stuff. And I, I think right now we are, we are at a moment where

928
00:57:48,905 --> 00:57:52,525
Speaker 2:  AI is like the main character and what, what it should be is like the

929
00:57:52,585 --> 00:57:56,085
Speaker 2:  camera. You know what I mean? Yeah, exactly. It's, I don't know, it's a bad

930
00:57:56,285 --> 00:57:59,845
Speaker 2:  metaphor, but I I am, I'm, I'm totally with you. So now that you've been

931
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:03,285
Speaker 2:  messing with this way of music consumption, what do you feel like is the

932
00:58:03,285 --> 00:58:06,805
Speaker 2:  right answer? How are you gonna do your own music to make sure you're getting

933
00:58:06,805 --> 00:58:07,565
Speaker 2:  the right kind of diet?

934
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:12,205
Speaker 5:  I feel like I have a pretty, I mean, our, our use case is

935
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:16,205
Speaker 5:  kind of weird in that like, I can't listen to songs with lyrics during

936
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:19,045
Speaker 5:  the day fair. And when I'm writing So, I have a movie,

937
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:20,565
Speaker 2:  Soundtracks, it's the only way movie

938
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:21,725
Speaker 5:  Soundtracks is good. I like

939
00:58:21,725 --> 00:58:24,885
Speaker 2:  That The Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack for like five years was all

940
00:58:24,885 --> 00:58:25,645
Speaker 2:  I wrote too. Oh God.

941
00:58:25,645 --> 00:58:28,605
Speaker 5:  It's amazing. Oh my God, if everything I start writing sounds is like super

942
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:32,365
Speaker 5:  epic and like, you'll know I've been putting on the parts

943
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:33,205
Speaker 5:  of the Caribbean

944
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:34,485
Speaker 2:  Cannot recommend it

945
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:37,765
Speaker 5:  Enough. Yeah, yeah. So, I have like kind of my,

946
00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:42,285
Speaker 5:  my genre for when I'm writing and working during the day. I think probably

947
00:58:42,305 --> 00:58:45,685
Speaker 5:  in there there's even a little room to experiment. Like I've listened to

948
00:58:45,685 --> 00:58:48,805
Speaker 5:  the same like coffee table jazz playlist

949
00:58:49,645 --> 00:58:50,405
Speaker 5:  probably a hundred times.

950
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:55,925
Speaker 5:  But then, yeah, it's like when the working day is over, I kind of like,

951
00:58:56,445 --> 00:59:00,405
Speaker 5:  I like having KXP on while I'm doing the dishes and while I'm in

952
00:59:00,405 --> 00:59:04,365
Speaker 5:  the car picking up my kid. And yeah. It doesn't feel

953
00:59:04,465 --> 00:59:07,285
Speaker 5:  as like, I don't need everything to be a banger. I don't know,

954
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:12,245
Speaker 5:  like maybe in different situations I'm a little more like, okay,

955
00:59:12,285 --> 00:59:15,405
Speaker 5:  I wanna listen to whatever it is right now, but

956
00:59:16,475 --> 00:59:20,365
Speaker 5:  sort of feels like a nice way to unplug from the day

957
00:59:20,505 --> 00:59:24,445
Speaker 5:  and, and hear a person hear some, probably a lot of songs I'll

958
00:59:24,445 --> 00:59:24,605
Speaker 5:  like.

959
00:59:25,355 --> 00:59:28,825
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think there's something to the kind of

960
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:32,505
Speaker 2:  unoptimized ness of that that is really,

961
00:59:33,335 --> 00:59:37,275
Speaker 2:  I don't know, encouraging and, and compelling in

962
00:59:37,275 --> 00:59:40,275
Speaker 2:  a way that listening to a playlist of things that are sort of ruthlessly

963
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:44,195
Speaker 2:  constructed for your oral pleasure is like,

964
00:59:44,215 --> 00:59:47,915
Speaker 2:  eh, you do, you get to the point where you're like, okay, this is, these

965
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:51,875
Speaker 2:  are great songs and I'm, I'm kind of over it. Yeah. But then the, the like

966
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:54,635
Speaker 2:  the peaks and valleys of like, oh my God, I love that song.

967
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,555
Speaker 2:  Versus what is this trash that they're playing for me for the next three

968
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:02,915
Speaker 2:  minutes Is it's, it is, it's just so hard to replicate. And I think we're

969
01:00:02,915 --> 01:00:06,555
Speaker 2:  gonna see a lot of companies and products try to emulate that.

970
01:00:08,415 --> 01:00:11,155
Speaker 2:  I'm not sure it's possible, I just don't know. If, you can do that with computers

971
01:00:11,215 --> 01:00:14,955
Speaker 2:  in a way that people doing people things is Yeah.

972
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:18,915
Speaker 2:  Gonna keep working like that. So should everyone listen to KEX exp, like,

973
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:22,195
Speaker 2:  is the move here? Find your own local radio station or just get into KEX

974
01:00:22,195 --> 01:00:23,275
Speaker 2:  exp and it'll solve all your problems.

975
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:27,595
Speaker 5:  I think it is. IKXP is streaming worldwide

976
01:00:27,815 --> 01:00:28,235
Speaker 5:  online.

977
01:00:30,195 --> 01:00:33,395
Speaker 5:  I am not a paid spokesperson for KX exp. I just really like it.

978
01:00:34,815 --> 01:00:38,515
Speaker 5:  But yeah, no, I, that was the really amazing thing about this

979
01:00:39,355 --> 01:00:42,595
Speaker 5:  comments on this article are people chiming in like, yeah, I have this station

980
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:46,675
Speaker 5:  and you know, shout out to the station in Milwaukee

981
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:50,435
Speaker 5:  or wherever you are. And they're, they're out there. It was, it was really

982
01:00:50,435 --> 01:00:54,035
Speaker 5:  gratifying to hear that people have their favorite indie

983
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:57,515
Speaker 5:  radio stations in, in our super

984
01:00:57,625 --> 01:01:01,435
Speaker 5:  optimized super Spotify time. So

985
01:01:01,465 --> 01:01:02,755
Speaker 5:  that was great to hear. Yeah.

986
01:01:03,115 --> 01:01:06,995
Speaker 2:  I will say the one other thing I would add in, in terms of like places

987
01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:10,715
Speaker 2:  to go for this kind of thing is YouTube is a surprisingly

988
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:15,115
Speaker 2:  rich place for people basically just doing radio.

989
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:19,195
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like, I think a lot of people know lo-Fi Girl and stuff like that,

990
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:22,915
Speaker 2:  which is a thing I really like for sort of the, the

991
01:01:23,165 --> 01:01:27,035
Speaker 2:  right vibe. But new music, I, I use it sort of

992
01:01:27,035 --> 01:01:30,755
Speaker 2:  as a mood setting thing, which I'm very happy to outsource. Like

993
01:01:30,955 --> 01:01:34,115
Speaker 2:  I don't need to know what the songs are called. I just want, I trust them

994
01:01:34,135 --> 01:01:37,115
Speaker 2:  to sort of make me feel the way that I'm looking for. But there are also

995
01:01:37,185 --> 01:01:41,075
Speaker 2:  lots of people out there doing really interesting mixes of like

996
01:01:41,075 --> 01:01:44,275
Speaker 2:  different kinds of genres and doing all kinds of really long

997
01:01:44,765 --> 01:01:48,515
Speaker 2:  radio DJ sets essentially. And there's tons of great

998
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:52,675
Speaker 2:  radio to do there. But I also would encourage people to go poke

999
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:56,635
Speaker 2:  around on the sort of endlessly streaming YouTube stations. Yeah.

1000
01:01:56,915 --> 01:01:58,395
Speaker 2:  'cause there's, there's some very cool stuff out there.

1001
01:01:58,865 --> 01:01:59,795
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Awesome.

1002
01:02:00,195 --> 01:02:03,435
Speaker 2:  I think we, we all need a little more of the like weird random discovery

1003
01:02:03,615 --> 01:02:04,635
Speaker 2:  in our lives. It's

1004
01:02:04,635 --> 01:02:07,715
Speaker 5:  Good. Eat your vegetables. Don't eat m and ms all day. As much

1005
01:02:07,715 --> 01:02:11,035
Speaker 2:  As I hate to say it, John Mayer's Apple Music radio station is very good.

1006
01:02:11,305 --> 01:02:14,835
Speaker 2:  It's very good. It's like I, I like

1007
01:02:14,835 --> 01:02:18,795
Speaker 2:  John Mayer a lot against my will, but here we're, this is just,

1008
01:02:18,795 --> 01:02:20,205
Speaker 2:  this is just what happened. He

1009
01:02:20,205 --> 01:02:24,005
Speaker 5:  Is a good musician. It's he he is like undeniable. However you feel

1010
01:02:24,005 --> 01:02:24,885
Speaker 5:  about him. Yeah,

1011
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:28,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, exactly. You this, this is, this is where I've landed. All right. Give

1012
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:31,245
Speaker 2:  us a music recommendation then. I'm gonna let you leave. We're, while we're

1013
01:02:31,245 --> 01:02:33,325
Speaker 2:  telling people to listen, what should everybody go listen to? Oh

1014
01:02:33,395 --> 01:02:33,685
Speaker 5:  Gosh.

1015
01:02:36,735 --> 01:02:40,455
Speaker 5:  I just heard, oh, Sudan archives. I

1016
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:44,735
Speaker 5:  saw her at a festival. I hear her on KXP all the time.

1017
01:02:44,985 --> 01:02:48,575
Speaker 5:  She's a Cincinnati girl like I am. Check her out.

1018
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:50,455
Speaker 5:  I, I love everything she's doing.

1019
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:54,855
Speaker 2:  Love that. I have been listening to Casey Musgraves nonstop for like two

1020
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:57,815
Speaker 2:  weeks. So it's probably good for me to go and branch equipment.

1021
01:02:57,845 --> 01:02:59,735
Speaker 5:  This will be good. Let's switch it up

1022
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:03,015
Speaker 2:  Allison, go have fun at the Children's Museum. Thank you as always.

1023
01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:03,895
Speaker 5:  Thanks.

1024
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:08,455
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

1025
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:10,575
Speaker 2:  take a question from The Verge cast hotline. We'll be right back.

1026
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:27,855
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the hotline as always. The number is

1027
01:04:27,855 --> 01:04:31,615
Speaker 2:  8 6 6 VERGE one one. The email is vergecast at The Verge

1028
01:04:31,675 --> 01:04:34,935
Speaker 2:  dot com. We love all of your questions and we try to answer at least one

1029
01:04:34,935 --> 01:04:38,575
Speaker 2:  on the show every week. Thank you to everybody who has reached out with thoughts

1030
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:42,135
Speaker 2:  about how we should be covering politics and the next Trump

1031
01:04:42,135 --> 01:04:45,535
Speaker 2:  administration and just the next four years of life in America.

1032
01:04:46,915 --> 01:04:50,375
Speaker 2:  We have a lot to think about. It's been really great to hear your thoughts

1033
01:04:50,435 --> 01:04:54,055
Speaker 2:  on what you do and don't want us to talk about and do and don't care about

1034
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:57,895
Speaker 2:  yourselves and how we as The Verge can make this stuff

1035
01:04:57,895 --> 01:05:01,415
Speaker 2:  make sense both kind of in our world but in a broader world. Thank you to

1036
01:05:01,415 --> 01:05:04,495
Speaker 2:  everybody who's reached out. But this week we do not have a question about

1037
01:05:04,495 --> 01:05:08,455
Speaker 2:  that. We have a question about one of the true central

1038
01:05:08,485 --> 01:05:11,615
Speaker 2:  tenants of The Vergecast and that is the Frame tv.

1039
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:13,035
Speaker 2:  Let's hear it.

1040
01:05:15,135 --> 01:05:18,485
Speaker 6:  It is Pete from North Carolina. I need some advice on the frame tv.

1041
01:05:19,225 --> 01:05:23,205
Speaker 6:  I'm probably not a normal TV buyer in that I'm almost 40 and I've never bought

1042
01:05:23,205 --> 01:05:25,725
Speaker 6:  a tv. The only reason I'm in the market now is that we had some inclement

1043
01:05:25,725 --> 01:05:29,685
Speaker 6:  weather out here recently and our old TV that was going on like 20 years

1044
01:05:29,705 --> 01:05:33,565
Speaker 6:  old got a piece of a window throw in. So what I'm looking at is

1045
01:05:33,665 --> 01:05:37,525
Speaker 6:  the only place in our house for a TV is the main room up on the mantle

1046
01:05:37,525 --> 01:05:40,805
Speaker 6:  place. It's pretty central and I hate the idea of having a big

1047
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:45,005
Speaker 6:  empty black void staring at the room, especially with our little kids 'cause

1048
01:05:45,005 --> 01:05:48,725
Speaker 6:  they're just gonna demand that some sort of cartoon is played on it. It's

1049
01:05:48,725 --> 01:05:52,525
Speaker 6:  also well used to be next to a big window that is getting

1050
01:05:52,525 --> 01:05:56,325
Speaker 6:  repaired. And so it gets a lot of light and

1051
01:05:56,755 --> 01:06:00,645
Speaker 6:  between that, it kind of seemed like the Frame TV or

1052
01:06:00,645 --> 01:06:04,565
Speaker 6:  something like it would be a good fit so that it's not getting too much glare

1053
01:06:04,785 --> 01:06:08,645
Speaker 6:  and when it's off it's not just begging for something to be

1054
01:06:08,645 --> 01:06:09,125
Speaker 6:  turned on.

1055
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:14,035
Speaker 6:  So that being said, I see

1056
01:06:14,245 --> 01:06:17,115
Speaker 6:  50 55 inch TVs on Best Buy

1057
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:21,995
Speaker 6:  for like 200 to $300 while the frame TV

1058
01:06:22,175 --> 01:06:25,955
Speaker 6:  is over a thousand. Can I justify paying that much

1059
01:06:26,295 --> 01:06:29,515
Speaker 6:  for something that hopefully will look nice?

1060
01:06:30,335 --> 01:06:33,955
Speaker 6:  Is that a good trade off? Is the Frame TV actually what I want in the middle

1061
01:06:33,955 --> 01:06:37,795
Speaker 6:  of my main room that I'm gonna be looking at all the time? I

1062
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:40,115
Speaker 6:  would love any advice you can gimme. Thanks. Bye.

1063
01:06:41,275 --> 01:06:45,045
Speaker 2:  When someone asks the question, is the frame TV actually what I want? There

1064
01:06:45,045 --> 01:06:47,525
Speaker 2:  is only one person to bring in and a Snee Patel. Hi Neli.

1065
01:06:48,165 --> 01:06:49,585
Speaker 7:  I'm just gonna answer that question

1066
01:06:51,095 --> 01:06:54,225
Speaker 7:  with a statement which is that Hollywood is doomed

1067
01:06:56,435 --> 01:07:00,305
Speaker 7:  embedded in that question. If, you listen to it carefully is

1068
01:07:00,305 --> 01:07:03,265
Speaker 7:  the complete destruction of the film and TV industry as we know it.

1069
01:07:03,765 --> 01:07:04,225
Speaker 2:  Say more,

1070
01:07:05,045 --> 01:07:09,015
Speaker 7:  Pete, you don't want a tv, you're 40 years old, you've gone your entire

1071
01:07:09,015 --> 01:07:12,975
Speaker 7:  life without purchasing a TV and I'm yours

1072
01:07:12,975 --> 01:07:16,415
Speaker 7:  got broken. And you're like, I should have a TV in this space because you

1073
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:19,975
Speaker 7:  think you need a TV and maybe you watch it sometimes and you don't want your

1074
01:07:19,975 --> 01:07:23,535
Speaker 7:  kids to watch cartoons on tv. So you're gonna buy something else

1075
01:07:23,755 --> 01:07:26,895
Speaker 7:  out of obligation to cultural norms.

1076
01:07:27,595 --> 01:07:31,535
Speaker 7:  And you're actively looking to spend money on a TV

1077
01:07:31,535 --> 01:07:35,495
Speaker 7:  whose picture quality sucks to prioritize how

1078
01:07:35,495 --> 01:07:39,245
Speaker 7:  it looks when it's turned off. It is just

1079
01:07:39,445 --> 01:07:43,285
Speaker 7:  a little, it's a little hop from there to not having a

1080
01:07:43,285 --> 01:07:46,885
Speaker 7:  tv. I don't know how more clearly I can say this, Hollywood is doomed.

1081
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:50,285
Speaker 7:  People don't wanna watch the TVs, they wanna watch TikTok.

1082
01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:56,045
Speaker 2:  I mean it is, it is true in a way that I had never really thought about

1083
01:07:56,045 --> 01:08:00,005
Speaker 2:  until you said that, that you are just assumed to have a television.

1084
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:03,445
Speaker 2:  Like we watch a lot of HGTV in our house and one of the things that drives

1085
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:07,285
Speaker 2:  me the most crazy is whenever they stage the houses at the

1086
01:08:07,445 --> 01:08:10,805
Speaker 2:  end, they're always beautiful and perfect and well set up. And you always

1087
01:08:10,805 --> 01:08:13,005
Speaker 2:  sit there and go, well where's the TV gonna go? They're gonna have to flip

1088
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:15,540
Speaker 2:  all this around 'cause they're gonna have to have a TV because you have to

1089
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:15,980
Speaker 2:  have a tv.

1090
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:20,975
Speaker 7:  I it, I'm the, the fact that people will spend money, I'll answer the

1091
01:08:20,975 --> 01:08:24,775
Speaker 7:  actual question with the Frame tv, but I'm just embedded in this question,

1092
01:08:24,915 --> 01:08:28,255
Speaker 7:  in this thought process is the end of the assumption

1093
01:08:28,845 --> 01:08:32,305
Speaker 7:  that everyone's gonna watch TV and once you break that assumption,

1094
01:08:32,755 --> 01:08:34,505
Speaker 7:  everything goes to hell. The

1095
01:08:34,505 --> 01:08:38,105
Speaker 2:  Description is kind of, I have a space on a wall where I'm supposed to put

1096
01:08:38,145 --> 01:08:42,105
Speaker 2:  a tv, not I want a tv. That is kind of the premise of this question.

1097
01:08:42,105 --> 01:08:42,545
Speaker 2:  You're right.

1098
01:08:42,895 --> 01:08:44,665
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Put up, hang up a picture,

1099
01:08:46,245 --> 01:08:46,705
Speaker 7:  you're gonna,

1100
01:08:46,845 --> 01:08:49,265
Speaker 2:  But what If, you bought a thousand dollars TV that let you hang up all the

1101
01:08:49,265 --> 01:08:49,585
Speaker 2:  pictures,

1102
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:53,025
Speaker 7:  Right? Can I? You sure may. Maybe that's what you want and you should spend

1103
01:08:53,025 --> 01:08:56,555
Speaker 7:  the money on that. Right? But if what you want

1104
01:08:57,055 --> 01:09:00,035
Speaker 7:  is to sometimes watch tv,

1105
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,755
Speaker 7:  you should spend $200 on a 55 inch TV and put it on a roller stand

1106
01:09:04,855 --> 01:09:08,795
Speaker 7:  and roll it into the garage and then roll it back out when you wanna

1107
01:09:08,795 --> 01:09:12,075
Speaker 7:  watch tv. Like, and you will quickly find that maybe you never wanted to

1108
01:09:12,075 --> 01:09:15,795
Speaker 7:  watch TV at all. And I, I just as a person who has

1109
01:09:15,925 --> 01:09:19,195
Speaker 7:  giant expensive TVs and wants to watch movies on them,

1110
01:09:20,475 --> 01:09:24,275
Speaker 7:  I every single day think, boy this TV

1111
01:09:24,295 --> 01:09:28,185
Speaker 7:  is off most of the time. Like we don't have it on all the time.

1112
01:09:28,305 --> 01:09:31,345
Speaker 7:  I have friends and family that keep their TVs on 24 7.

1113
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,945
Speaker 7:  Fine. That's another way to go. But it doesn't sound like that's what Pete

1114
01:09:34,945 --> 01:09:38,345
Speaker 7:  wants to do. No, the reason I'm always ranting and raving about the Frame

1115
01:09:38,365 --> 01:09:42,275
Speaker 7:  TV is that the TV of it is

1116
01:09:42,495 --> 01:09:45,795
Speaker 7:  pretty compromised, right? It's a, it's a very old panel. It doesn't have

1117
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:49,515
Speaker 7:  local dimming backlight. It's not Samsung's latest l CD tech.

1118
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:52,555
Speaker 7:  It doesn't have Dolby vision, which is a Samsung choice.

1119
01:09:53,895 --> 01:09:57,715
Speaker 7:  It Prince Tieszen like I I'm just sorry. Yeah. Right. Like it's all, it's

1120
01:09:57,715 --> 01:10:01,515
Speaker 7:  all this stuff, but it has the matte finish and it has

1121
01:10:01,515 --> 01:10:05,075
Speaker 7:  the art store and you can put a frame on it and you can hang it on the wall

1122
01:10:05,255 --> 01:10:09,235
Speaker 7:  and people prioritize how it looks way over the picture

1123
01:10:09,235 --> 01:10:12,435
Speaker 7:  quality. Right. Or the how the TV of it works.

1124
01:10:13,095 --> 01:10:16,835
Speaker 7:  And that's, and that's fine. I'm just saying it's just a short hop to the

1125
01:10:16,835 --> 01:10:19,595
Speaker 7:  next thing. So Pete, what I recommend is you really feel like you need to

1126
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:23,315
Speaker 7:  have a Mac finished TV showing a picture. There are now much cheaper

1127
01:10:23,715 --> 01:10:26,955
Speaker 7:  rifts on a Frame TV from a bunch of companies.

1128
01:10:27,675 --> 01:10:31,595
Speaker 7:  TCL has one, ENS has one, right? Like everyone knows

1129
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:34,715
Speaker 7:  this is the market and I think the the prices will come down the Frame TV

1130
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:38,795
Speaker 7:  itself is whatever, like the Art store, same thing has done a great job with

1131
01:10:38,795 --> 01:10:42,555
Speaker 7:  the art store. They have spent a lot of time and energy

1132
01:10:42,555 --> 01:10:46,355
Speaker 7:  making the deals and getting the licenses and da da da. But are you gonna

1133
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:49,635
Speaker 7:  pay $50 a month for the art store If? You're not. Then you should just get

1134
01:10:49,635 --> 01:10:52,715
Speaker 7:  another matte finished TV that can be framed of which now there are several

1135
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:55,475
Speaker 7:  and put up a picture of your family or something.

1136
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:59,515
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Ironically, Pete I think is coming into this thinking. He's, he's kind

1137
01:10:59,515 --> 01:11:03,035
Speaker 2:  of like really trying to decide which is the best TV to buy, which like would

1138
01:11:03,155 --> 01:11:07,035
Speaker 2:  make him Neli people. He's actually my people. He's like, I I don't care

1139
01:11:07,035 --> 01:11:10,595
Speaker 2:  about my tv, I just need to have one. Right. Like I think if you're starting

1140
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:14,565
Speaker 2:  from a 20-year-old tv, frankly the Frame TV is probably gonna

1141
01:11:14,565 --> 01:11:18,005
Speaker 2:  look great. The the 20-year-old panel you had on your wall, it's probably

1142
01:11:18,005 --> 01:11:21,965
Speaker 2:  a big upgrade to even the Frame tv. But I do think you're right that clearly

1143
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:26,285
Speaker 2:  the, the goal is not I want the best television. Is it the Frame tv?

1144
01:11:26,285 --> 01:11:28,845
Speaker 2:  Like I don't think anyone is arguing that it's that, and that's not what

1145
01:11:28,845 --> 01:11:30,085
Speaker 2:  Pete wants either. Yeah.

1146
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:33,325
Speaker 7:  If, you wanna spend a thousand dollars on a TV at So Crate you should buy

1147
01:11:33,365 --> 01:11:34,525
Speaker 7:  a 55 inch ole.

1148
01:11:34,735 --> 01:11:38,645
Speaker 2:  Right. But I think if, if, if the question is like, how do I solve this specific

1149
01:11:38,645 --> 01:11:42,485
Speaker 2:  problem that I have, it seems like the cheapest riff on the frame TV

1150
01:11:42,985 --> 01:11:44,045
Speaker 2:  is probably what you're after

1151
01:11:44,265 --> 01:11:47,645
Speaker 7:  Or get What's that? Samsung's easel tv. These are all expensive. Hell Oh

1152
01:11:47,645 --> 01:11:51,485
Speaker 7:  yeah. Get that LG Suitcase tv. I'm not

1153
01:11:51,485 --> 01:11:53,125
Speaker 7:  kidding. That's actually, you don't want a tv.

1154
01:11:53,235 --> 01:11:54,445
Speaker 2:  That might be the Solve It,

1155
01:11:54,905 --> 01:11:58,485
Speaker 7:  Buy the TV that goes in a suitcase and put it on the kitchen table once a

1156
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:01,365
Speaker 7:  month when you wanna watch a movie. Like yeah, there are, there are just

1157
01:12:01,435 --> 01:12:05,085
Speaker 7:  many, many more ways to solve the problem of sometimes

1158
01:12:05,265 --> 01:12:08,965
Speaker 7:  we all want to sit around a screen, get a projector and

1159
01:12:09,035 --> 01:12:10,045
Speaker 7:  hang up a Bedsheet

1160
01:12:10,065 --> 01:12:13,925
Speaker 2:  So I had the projector thought, but I think the place it sits in

1161
01:12:13,925 --> 01:12:16,485
Speaker 2:  Pete's house where it's like a space that gets a lot of light and is kind

1162
01:12:16,485 --> 01:12:20,405
Speaker 2:  of screwy. That might be, that might undo the projector, but, but I

1163
01:12:20,405 --> 01:12:24,285
Speaker 2:  think the, the TV you can put away theory here in some

1164
01:12:24,285 --> 01:12:25,845
Speaker 2:  way is actually maybe the solution.

1165
01:12:26,035 --> 01:12:29,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I looked it up, I'd forgotten what it's called. It's the LG Stand By

1166
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:30,005
Speaker 7:  Me Go.

1167
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:37,175
Speaker 7:  It's a 27 inch tv. It's in a, you know, it's something like a, one of those

1168
01:12:37,175 --> 01:12:41,015
Speaker 7:  like James Bond metal briefcases. It's expensive, it lists

1169
01:12:41,075 --> 01:12:43,855
Speaker 7:  it over a thousand, I bet on Black Friday. It gets really cheap.

1170
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:49,715
Speaker 7:  Buy a Smart Monitor. I have a 40 inch Samsung smart

1171
01:12:49,715 --> 01:12:53,595
Speaker 7:  monitor that I bought for $300. Throw that in a closet. Like,

1172
01:12:53,655 --> 01:12:56,915
Speaker 7:  I'm just saying, there are many, many more ways to solve this problem

1173
01:12:57,705 --> 01:13:01,085
Speaker 7:  or buy a cheap frame tv. But I, I've just, every time I get this question

1174
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,965
Speaker 7:  out, I hear from people who are like, I want a TV

1175
01:13:04,965 --> 01:13:08,765
Speaker 7:  that looks good when it's off and I'm constantly coming back to it is

1176
01:13:08,795 --> 01:13:11,965
Speaker 7:  just a tiny jump to I don't need this at all.

1177
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:16,445
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah. I mean, it makes me think, do you remember that CESA

1178
01:13:16,445 --> 01:13:20,285
Speaker 2:  few years ago where LG had that rollable TV that you like pulled up out of

1179
01:13:20,285 --> 01:13:24,045
Speaker 2:  a case? Like that's the kind of thing we all need

1180
01:13:24,425 --> 01:13:27,765
Speaker 2:  is like, I just, I wanna be able to hide that behind a bunch of books and

1181
01:13:27,765 --> 01:13:30,845
Speaker 2:  then pull it out, unroll it and watch a movie and then put it away. And I

1182
01:13:30,845 --> 01:13:34,725
Speaker 2:  think like that's the sort of thing that would be great. And I think

1183
01:13:34,725 --> 01:13:37,245
Speaker 2:  the, the thing about Pete's question I keep thinking about is, is if I put

1184
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:41,005
Speaker 2:  this TV here, my kids will want something on it. And like, I'm sure

1185
01:13:41,105 --> 01:13:44,965
Speaker 2:  you feel that, but like, oh God, do I feel that I would love to be

1186
01:13:44,965 --> 01:13:48,125
Speaker 2:  able to, I hide the remote now because if he can't find the remote,

1187
01:13:49,065 --> 01:13:52,285
Speaker 2:  I'm like, oh, sorry, I can't find the remote. But he, he goes, he just points

1188
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:56,205
Speaker 2:  at the tv, which is at his eye level and is like, put it on

1189
01:13:56,785 --> 01:13:57,805
Speaker 7:  And it would be,

1190
01:13:58,035 --> 01:14:01,925
Speaker 2:  It's, I, there there is more and more appeal to putting the TV away

1191
01:14:02,075 --> 01:14:02,845
Speaker 2:  than ever. For

1192
01:14:02,845 --> 01:14:06,445
Speaker 7:  Me it's all, it's all fun and games until they get iPads,

1193
01:14:06,965 --> 01:14:10,085
Speaker 7:  that problem instantly resolves the second the iPad or the Chromebook is

1194
01:14:10,085 --> 01:14:14,045
Speaker 7:  delivered. Right. For better and for worse. Even things that I've tried to

1195
01:14:14,045 --> 01:14:17,005
Speaker 7:  turn into, like this is a a TV thing,

1196
01:14:17,865 --> 01:14:21,725
Speaker 7:  the ERAS tour, we're gonna watch this on the tv. She instantly figured out

1197
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:25,165
Speaker 7:  how to get it on Disney Plus, right? Like everything moved yesterday. I walked

1198
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:28,405
Speaker 7:  into our kitchen and she was listening to music on her iPad speakers

1199
01:14:29,145 --> 01:14:32,805
Speaker 7:  in a house where she's surrounded by speakers can just

1200
01:14:32,975 --> 01:14:36,125
Speaker 7:  speak into the void to ask a music service to start playing

1201
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:40,125
Speaker 7:  and knows how to use airplay. I've taught my 6-year-old how to use airplay,

1202
01:14:40,615 --> 01:14:43,845
Speaker 7:  still listening to music on her iPad speakers. What are we gonna do about

1203
01:14:43,845 --> 01:14:44,525
Speaker 7:  this? Yeah, I,

1204
01:14:44,885 --> 01:14:48,725
Speaker 2:  I bought a whole Sonos system and my wife listens to podcasts out of the

1205
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:52,605
Speaker 2:  speaker on her phone and it will never, ever stop making me crazy. Mine

1206
01:14:52,605 --> 01:14:56,205
Speaker 7:  As well. I'm just saying, Pete, buy what you buy, what you want, buy what

1207
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:59,725
Speaker 7:  fits your budget, buy most people just prioritize size.

1208
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:05,045
Speaker 7:  All TVs are bright. I'm gonna call out Casey Newton here. Casey asked me

1209
01:15:05,045 --> 01:15:08,725
Speaker 7:  on TV to buy and I told him and then he bought a Frame TV and I said, how's

1210
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:11,725
Speaker 7:  the picture? And he was like, it's so bright. And that was the end of that

1211
01:15:11,725 --> 01:15:12,245
Speaker 7:  conversation.

1212
01:15:14,395 --> 01:15:16,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And that, that's, that's

1213
01:15:16,285 --> 01:15:18,085
Speaker 2:  Fine. Casey is also my people when it comes to

1214
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:21,365
Speaker 7:  TVs. Yeah. We're talking about this in early November, so we're just a few

1215
01:15:21,365 --> 01:15:24,885
Speaker 7:  days away from Black Friday so that the Frame TV will go on. Huge sale always

1216
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:28,565
Speaker 7:  does Last year's frame tv, which is fine. They're

1217
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:32,245
Speaker 7:  Samsung spends no money developing these. It's the same TV every year and

1218
01:15:32,245 --> 01:15:36,205
Speaker 7:  they just collect huge margins on them last year's Frame TV will

1219
01:15:36,205 --> 01:15:39,645
Speaker 7:  go on even deeper sale. And then you've got the new class of

1220
01:15:40,355 --> 01:15:43,805
Speaker 7:  competitors, right? You've got the High Sense Canvas tv,

1221
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:48,245
Speaker 7:  the T-C-L-N-X-T, frame tv, the next frame tv.

1222
01:15:49,265 --> 01:15:52,765
Speaker 7:  Amazon has the, the Fire TV Omni, which has adaptive

1223
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:56,725
Speaker 7:  brightness and art. There's just a lot of these and they're all gonna go

1224
01:15:56,725 --> 01:16:00,645
Speaker 7:  on sale on Black Friday and it's, it's worth just looking at them and

1225
01:16:00,645 --> 01:16:03,805
Speaker 7:  thinking, will this solve my problem of it's there.

1226
01:16:04,945 --> 01:16:06,405
Speaker 7:  That's the problem you're trying to solve.

1227
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:10,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I just looked it up. By the way, the 55 inch Omni TV currently on sale

1228
01:16:10,665 --> 01:16:14,365
Speaker 2:  for $369, like this is, this is a cheaper

1229
01:16:14,365 --> 01:16:17,885
Speaker 2:  problem to solve than a thousand dollars for mtv. However you choose to solve

1230
01:16:17,885 --> 01:16:21,165
Speaker 2:  it, you can do it for less than a thousand dollars for mtv. I feel pretty

1231
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:21,565
Speaker 2:  good about that

1232
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:25,725
Speaker 7:  And I'm a hundred percent confident that they'll be even cheaper on

1233
01:16:25,725 --> 01:16:26,085
Speaker 7:  Black Friday.

1234
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:29,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, there we go. That's just the way it goes. Awesome. All right, I hope

1235
01:16:29,325 --> 01:16:32,405
