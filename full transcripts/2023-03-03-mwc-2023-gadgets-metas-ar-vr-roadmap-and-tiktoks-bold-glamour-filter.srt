00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,960
Speaker 4:  Hello and welcome to the flagship podcast, mobile

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,720
Speaker 4:  World Congress.

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,240
Speaker 1:  Did we get that? That one, is that, is that a sponsorship? We got?

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,200
Speaker 4:  What we're getting is a letter about how we're not that from

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,120
Speaker 4:  the Europeans, but Mobile World Congress is great. There's a, there's a

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,840
Speaker 4:  Senate, there's a 5G Senate and then there's a house of Mid-Range Android

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,320
Speaker 4:  funds. Every once a year they come together. I don't know why it's called

28
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,520
Speaker 4:  Mobile World Congress. Anyway, I'm your friend Eli Alex Kranz is here.

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,760
Speaker 1:  I'm your friend who also doesn't know why it's called Mobile World Congress.

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,160
Speaker 1:  Sorry.

31
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,320
Speaker 4:  It is a very European name. Richard Lawler is here.

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,920
Speaker 5:  I'm here. I did not vote for any of this representation.

33
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,560
Speaker 4:  I saw a very rude tweet this week that was like Mobile Congress is

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,680
Speaker 4:  hilarious. It's thousands of companies coming together to compete with Apple,

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,280
Speaker 4:  which does not attend. And I want to say one that is

36
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,200
Speaker 4:  inaccurate and I'll explain why. Two, I lulled like, I definitely just laughed

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,840
Speaker 4:  cuz there's like a, there's an internal truth to it. Like if you live in

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,760
Speaker 4:  an insular apple world, like that's the most true thing you've ever heard.

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,800
Speaker 4:  And it's very funny. And then everyone else is like, no, but we're companies

40
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,040
Speaker 4:  like we build the networks. You, you need us to

41
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,400
Speaker 4:  exist for the iPhone to work

42
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,400
Speaker 5:  Your iPhone uses all of these things.

43
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,040
Speaker 4:  Actually I was entertained. It was very funny and it, and it's like very

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,840
Speaker 4:  small way. But Mobile World Congress was this week. If you don't know,

45
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,000
Speaker 4:  I have no idea why you're listening to this show, but welcome all are welcome

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,720
Speaker 4:  here. Now I will explain to you what Mobile World Congress or MWC is.

47
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,680
Speaker 4:  This is the podcast you've chosen to listen to. Mwc we've been going to for

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,400
Speaker 4:  years and years. The CS is a show. I think everybody who is

49
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,520
Speaker 4:  in and around tech is familiar with. It's the big trade show in the United States

50
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,640
Speaker 4:  where God only knows what happens there anymore. Samsung shows up,

51
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,840
Speaker 4:  they're like, now the fridge has a 47 inch TV built into it. They're, ooh,

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,160
Speaker 4:  ah. Then there's Effa, which is the European version of that thing.

53
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,520
Speaker 4:  If A, and then there's M W C, the World

54
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,040
Speaker 4:  Congress, which for a minute I would say Richard

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,000
Speaker 4:  was like the most important trade show of them all because it is the mobile

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,880
Speaker 4:  phone trade show and it's gigantic. It's in Barcelona. We all

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,360
Speaker 4:  have gone over the years like literally thousands and thousands of companies

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,000
Speaker 4:  from around the world. This is where 3G was debuted, it was our

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,200
Speaker 4:  4G was debuted, it's our 5g. Like this is that show.

60
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,200
Speaker 4:  And what's interesting is well the iPhone kind of won. Like that's why that

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,080
Speaker 4:  joke is funny, right? Like the iPhone won in a meaningful way but

62
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,960
Speaker 4:  the show is is back, right? It's like post Covid back in full

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,240
Speaker 4:  force and kind of like a lot of things happened there.

64
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,600
Speaker 5:  Yeah, back in the days of G P R S, it was a whole different story.

65
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. This is a show where it's like Intel's gonna show up with Ymax.

66
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,480
Speaker 4:  Wow. And it was like, are they right? Like it's a show where these battles

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,280
Speaker 4:  happen. It's where Windows Mobile made it debut. Windows

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,000
Speaker 4:  Mobile 6.5 actually for like old heads who are listening to this one, remember

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,080
Speaker 4:  this when we were all at in gadget and like Steve Bomber was like, here's

70
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,880
Speaker 4:  Windows Mobile 6.5 and all they had done

71
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,480
Speaker 4:  to compete with the iPhone was they took old janky Windows mobile

72
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,000
Speaker 4:  and they added a honeycomb shaped launcher to the home screen.

73
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,640
Speaker 4:  And people were like, it's over. Microsoft's defeated

74
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,560
Speaker 4:  the iPhone. Like that's M W C. There's, there's an a

75
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,400
Speaker 4:  number of amazing Sony Erickson, I I, the history here is great. Again, if

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,320
Speaker 4:  you're an old head, a lot of amazing things that happened to Barcelona,

77
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,000
Speaker 5:  What didn't work, the, the list of things that did not work is something

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,400
Speaker 5:  that we could go on for literally hours. But what we saw this year,

79
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,520
Speaker 5:  John Porter was there at the show at M W C. He handled all all of these phones,

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,840
Speaker 5:  some of these laptops, these other mobile devices. He noticed a trend of

81
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,560
Speaker 5:  seeing kind of the things that you could see in future phones. Each phone

82
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,320
Speaker 5:  kind of had its own distinctive thing. We had something like this. Hm. MD

83
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,120
Speaker 5:  now makes these phones so they call Nokia's. So they've got this G 22

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,080
Speaker 5:  that costs less than $200 and it's designed specifically so that you can

85
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,160
Speaker 5:  fix it. You could replace the battery, they say in around five minutes you

86
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,920
Speaker 5:  could swap out the screen in under 20 minutes and they're gonna have a partnership

87
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,800
Speaker 5:  with i Fixit to sell replacement parts. So if that's something that you've

88
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,240
Speaker 5:  been looking for, I want a phone that I can actually work on myself,

89
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,360
Speaker 5:  replace and keep for probably as long as the software updates

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,320
Speaker 5:  keep going. You might have that option with this phone that is actually going

91
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,720
Speaker 5:  to be coming out this year or actually coming out now in this next week or

92
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,200
Speaker 5:  so. But

93
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,880
Speaker 1:  It's, it's not a fair phone. It's, it's a little more complex.

94
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,360
Speaker 1:  It's got like water resistance. It's not waterproof but it's

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,920
Speaker 1:  got water resistance, which is one of the things they always said, oh your

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,040
Speaker 1:  phone can't be repairable otherwise it won't be water resistant. And like

97
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,920
Speaker 1:  watchmakers are like, that's not true. We've done this for a very long time

98
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,360
Speaker 1:  and phone makers are like, oh maybe we can catch up that one. Like that was

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,040
Speaker 1:  kind of the one that I was really excited about. Is it weird to be really

100
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,320
Speaker 1:  excited about a phone just because I can replace the battery?

101
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean at, at this point replace the battery and phone is like a deeply

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,200
Speaker 4:  political act, right? You're like, you know like if, if you made the movie

103
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,680
Speaker 4:  pump up the volume again in 2023, right? Instead of

104
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,520
Speaker 4:  broadcasting Pirate radio, Christian Slater would be in his basement like

105
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,880
Speaker 4:  doing an iPhone repair kiosk. You know the cops would come to each.

106
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,840
Speaker 4:  But if anyone is listening and wants to reboot the movie, pump up the volume

107
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,680
Speaker 4:  with Christian Slater is a rogue teenage iPhone repairman. I can write that

108
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,840
Speaker 4:  script in maybe an hour.

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,320
Speaker 1:  Christian Slater will still be playing the teenager.

110
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,040
Speaker 5:  If only this were the peak of streaming, we could get a 20 episode series

111
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,000
Speaker 4:  Out of that. I can't believe I missed it. How did I only come to us now?

112
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,040
Speaker 4:  So the the Nok story, it is really interesting. This week Nokia is

113
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,560
Speaker 4:  split effectively into two companies. They license the old Nokia name to

114
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,160
Speaker 4:  this company H M D, which is making handsets this handset's. Very cool.

115
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,240
Speaker 4:  The best part is that I fix it is selling a repair kit with it. And you should

116
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,880
Speaker 4:  go look at this picture on our side, pull your car over and go look at the

117
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,040
Speaker 4:  picture. There's, I believe I fix it called this these smudger.

118
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,120
Speaker 4:  That's the tool that you use to crack open the screen, you know like little

119
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,720
Speaker 4:  plastic wedge to get in there. The smudger that comes with this phone, it

120
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,680
Speaker 4:  looks like a pocket knife. It right? It looks like you should be able to

121
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,400
Speaker 4:  like quickly flip it out and then something. I love it

122
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,520
Speaker 4:  like it's perfect. I think more phone repair tools should look

123
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,600
Speaker 4:  vaguely dangerous.

124
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,600
Speaker 1:  Yes, a hundred percent. I think people would be more into repairability

125
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,960
Speaker 1:  if the tools look vaguely dangerous

126
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,400
Speaker 5:  And they're all color matched

127
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,120
Speaker 4:  And they're all color matched. The whole thing's great. I looked at the,

128
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,920
Speaker 4:  I was like is that a knife nuts a smudger. It also

129
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,640
Speaker 4:  comes with these like guitar pick the whole thing's fun. So that's great.

130
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,440
Speaker 4:  But that's HMDs Nokia. Yeah. And so they're still, you know, this is

131
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,280
Speaker 4:  like the classic thing you do when you have a legendary brand. Polaroid is

132
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,480
Speaker 4:  like the example. You sell the brand off for parts, you let people license

133
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,280
Speaker 4:  it. You just squeeze all the money outta the brand equity until

134
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,760
Speaker 4:  you're done. Nokia kind of doing that and handsets, right? Like whatever,

135
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,240
Speaker 4:  we're gonna let this Chinese company make handsets. HMD is doing something

136
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,800
Speaker 4:  kind of cool here but it's still operating at the very low end of the market,

137
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,720
Speaker 4:  right? This is $150 handset. Okay? But cool comes with comes with

138
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,400
Speaker 4:  the weird smudger knife on the other side there's

139
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,480
Speaker 4:  the Nokia that actually remains as Nokia, which is the

140
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,440
Speaker 4:  networking equipment manufacturer. They make the 5G base stations

141
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,120
Speaker 4:  and the cell towers and the software that connects it all together. And their

142
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Speaker 4:  big news at MWC was people think we still make phones so our

143
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,880
Speaker 4:  solution is to change our logo to something ridiculous

144
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,040
Speaker 1:  Real Kia.

145
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,800
Speaker 4:  So I think the Kia thing worked. Do

146
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,480
Speaker 5:  You, in case you don't know Kia changed their logo and now people are trying

147
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,800
Speaker 5:  to Google the K in car. Is it that they're looking for,

148
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,480
Speaker 4:  Wait, let's just, let's just back this up. Let's ba back it up. Let's

149
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,480
Speaker 4:  separate the two words that sound the same from each other. Nokia,

150
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,600
Speaker 4:  the 5G equipment company changed its logo. Yes. And then what

151
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,560
Speaker 4:  we all, all immediately started talking about was Kia the car company,

152
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,720
Speaker 4:  which admittedly is just a confusing transition but makes

153
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,240
Speaker 4:  perfect sense because Kia changed its logo

154
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,120
Speaker 4:  I think last year to something much more angular and stylish

155
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,240
Speaker 4:  and everyone thinks it says K N. So then we have,

156
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,000
Speaker 4:  we have run stories. Other people have run stories that people see the

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,520
Speaker 4:  cars, they think the cars look cool cause new Kia cars, a lot of them look

158
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,480
Speaker 4:  cool and then they start Googling k n car. I'm telling you

159
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,360
Speaker 4:  this is a gigantic victory for Kia, right? Like in

160
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,680
Speaker 4:  the boardrooms of Kia when they're like, did the logo redesign work?

161
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,240
Speaker 4:  They're like, yes, everyone is talking about our logo.

162
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,760
Speaker 4:  And now if you know something about cars you are waiting to

163
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,720
Speaker 4:  jump out of a bush when someone's like, what's that can car to be like that's

164
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,640
Speaker 4:  a Kia. And then you then you have a five minute conversation about their

165
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,920
Speaker 4:  logo. Like I'm, I'm telling you this all worked. The earned media for Kia

166
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,720
Speaker 4:  off the charts, everyone's talking about Kia's, the Kia logos. I'm

167
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,400
Speaker 4:  assuming they do not like talking about the Kia Boys, the gang of TikTok

168
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Speaker 4:  Thieves fair, how to steal Hyundai and Kia

169
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,040
Speaker 4:  cars very easily. That seems like a less good

170
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,520
Speaker 4:  outcome for them. This is true by the way, it's Kia boys with a z. We've

171
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,440
Speaker 4:  written about that. I think we talked about them last week, didn't we? We

172
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,080
Speaker 4:  did. Anyhow, so the Kia logo I think like worked really well cuz

173
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,800
Speaker 4:  it was like a consumer and you can probably argue with me about this.

174
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,040
Speaker 1:  I, I would absolutely argue with you cuz I, I rode in

175
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,800
Speaker 1:  one of those Kias with a K and I was just like, what off brand

176
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,800
Speaker 1:  nonsense is my friend bought for a car and now I'm sitting in

177
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,160
Speaker 1:  it and am I going to die?

178
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,720
Speaker 4:  To be fair, that's what people have thought about Kia for a decade.

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,960
Speaker 1:  Yeah I I was like why did she meet from Kia to whatever this

180
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,440
Speaker 1:  is? She's got the worst taste in cars. And then I think like

181
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,800
Speaker 1:  Andy or someone wrote the story and I was like, oh,

182
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,240
Speaker 1:  oh she's just with Kia still.

183
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,160
Speaker 5:  Okay maybe it's not a dub for Kia.

184
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,760
Speaker 4:  See you see what I'm saying? This it worked. It's a seared in

185
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,960
Speaker 4:  your brain and now the next time someone's like what's a can car? You've

186
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,200
Speaker 4:  got a whole story about Kia to tell and now you've talked about Kia for five

187
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,520
Speaker 4:  minutes. I'm telling you this work

188
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,160
Speaker 5:  For them. And we did on the podcast and now Nok which is not the company

189
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,200
Speaker 5:  that makes Nok phones, although there is a company that makes Nok phones.

190
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,720
Speaker 5:  There is another company that is still Nok, that is the old Nokia that does

191
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,960
Speaker 5:  not make phones and wants people to know that it does not make phones. And

192
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,320
Speaker 5:  so they did not change their name to something that is other than Nokia,

193
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,920
Speaker 5:  which is still on phones that are coming out now. They just changed the way

194
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,200
Speaker 5:  the logo

195
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,480
Speaker 4:  Looks to make it look more like the Kia logo.

196
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,320
Speaker 1:  No key

197
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,400
Speaker 4:  But so it's, go look at it, they've removed most of the vertical

198
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,360
Speaker 4:  stems from the letters. There's no other way to describe this logo. Like

199
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,760
Speaker 4:  imagine the word Nokia and then be like what if we just remove

200
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,080
Speaker 4:  most of the vertical lines Save for the eye. Yeah.

201
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,040
Speaker 4:  So you get something that looks very much like vo Shia

202
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,760
Speaker 4:  and it's gonna be printed on cell towers around the world. Cuz that's what

203
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,200
Speaker 4:  they make. They make cell towers and software and like, you know like quarter

204
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,160
Speaker 4:  zip fleece vests, like enterprise stuff and you're not even getting at

205
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,720
Speaker 4:  that moment where like that car looks cool, what's K N and Google it. It's

206
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,040
Speaker 4:  just gonna be like, what is that weird enterprise company? And you're going

207
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,280
Speaker 4:  to continue riding the escalator at the airport.

208
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,680
Speaker 1:  It looks like, you know when you're watching a movie

209
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,040
Speaker 1:  and the alien picks up their little alien phone and they start typing

210
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,840
Speaker 1:  to other aliens with their alien language. It looks like the alien

211
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,480
Speaker 1:  languages.

212
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,600
Speaker 4:  That's what they were going for.

213
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,840
Speaker 1:  I liked your pronunciation though. That feels like the right pronunciation.

214
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,560
Speaker 4:  That's, it's very finished. Anyhow, that was like the other big news. It's

215
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,920
Speaker 4:  like the biggest story is like Nokia rebrand. It was like the first thing

216
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,400
Speaker 4:  was snatched.

217
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,440
Speaker 5:  That was not the biggest news. Not, not the most I important news.

218
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Speaker 4:  All right, what else you got

219
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,920
Speaker 5:  Richard? The Motorola riser.

220
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,480
Speaker 4:  Oh my

221
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,200
Speaker 5:  God, the riser. The only phone that we want to discuss from M W C, it is

222
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,960
Speaker 5:  not called the riser or it has not been called that yet, but it should be.

223
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,840
Speaker 5:  Everyone agrees. Motorola showed off rollable screen devices. We, we saw

224
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,360
Speaker 5:  a laptop and we saw a phone from Lenovo both using the same technology,

225
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,440
Speaker 5:  neither one with a release date or price or anything like that. But they

226
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,720
Speaker 5:  look like real devices look like something that we could see in the near

227
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,280
Speaker 5:  and near future.

228
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,520
Speaker 4:  So this is a thing that Lenovo does on the regular, right? So

229
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,480
Speaker 4:  the short version of the history here, Motorola was a company that

230
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,400
Speaker 4:  existed then they tried to compete with Samsung, it's in

231
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,280
Speaker 4:  Go so great. Then Google bought Motorola in order to regain

232
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,800
Speaker 4:  some control over the Android ecosystem. Then Samsung

233
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,160
Speaker 4:  made the software on its phone. So ridiculous. This is a true

234
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,600
Speaker 4:  story that Andy Rubin at CES was like, what are you doing to my precious,

235
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,680
Speaker 4:  precious android bring it back to reality. And Samsung said, we'll

236
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,120
Speaker 4:  do it if you sell Motorola and don't compete with us directly. This is a

237
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,000
Speaker 4:  true story. So then Google sold Motorola to Lenovo and then

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,520
Speaker 4:  later on bought HTC and that's fine. I don't, that's,

239
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,360
Speaker 4:  it's a little weedsy there. But ever since Lenovo has bought Motorola,

240
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,680
Speaker 4:  they roll out kind of like on the regular, like pretty interesting

241
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,320
Speaker 4:  concept devices, both laptops and phones to show that they sell

242
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,880
Speaker 4:  hardware shops and then some of them come out and some of 'em don't. So they

243
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
Speaker 4:  show off this phone, which we will discuss whether or not it is called the

244
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,760
Speaker 4:  Riser, but they show off this phone. That is so cool. So it's a

245
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,000
Speaker 4:  rollable phone, it's not a foldable phone. So it's a little more

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,920
Speaker 4:  Squareish Richard. And then when you unlock it or you

247
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,560
Speaker 4:  go to watch a YouTube video or something, the screen rolls out, it extends

248
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,440
Speaker 4:  to become 16 by nine, which is just cool as hell in my

249
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,120
Speaker 5:  Opinion. Yeah, like it goes IMAX mode essentially. Like suddenly you have

250
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,680
Speaker 5:  an ultra wide screen now to watch your videos or whatever. Just when you

251
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,640
Speaker 5:  need that extra space on the laptop if you, if you want your spreadsheets

252
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,560
Speaker 5:  and everything on the screen and you gotta see all your rows. Okay, now,

253
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,520
Speaker 5:  now I need extra space. I think, I think we talked about this what a couple

254
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,280
Speaker 5:  weeks ago where we've said on the plane you're gonna extend your super tall

255
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,040
Speaker 5:  laptop screen. Yeah, they're chasing that market. They, they are,

256
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,200
Speaker 5:  they're following exactly what what we're saying. But the, the phone is something

257
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,160
Speaker 5:  that in your pocket, it's just gonna be the same as any other phone. But

258
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,320
Speaker 5:  then suddenly when you need some extra space, there you go. And it's not

259
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,200
Speaker 5:  super thick or has a hinge necessarily like we've seen from these foldable

260
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,440
Speaker 5:  foams and at least from the demos it, it looks cool.

261
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah it looks really cool the, when the screen is retracted because

262
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,200
Speaker 4:  it's a rollable, it's curved around the back. So you can use

263
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,920
Speaker 4:  the rear of the screen is like a selfie camera with the rear

264
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,360
Speaker 4:  camera, which I think rules and then you can get like status updates, all

265
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,240
Speaker 4:  this other stuff there. This is the part of the phone cycle now

266
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,160
Speaker 4:  where it seems like the hardware technology of

267
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,080
Speaker 4:  Rollie bendy flexible screens is not yet mature. It's obviously

268
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,480
Speaker 4:  not shipping in any particular volume outside of Samsung, but it's mature

269
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,280
Speaker 4:  enough that we can see what the product should look like and the ideas are

270
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,520
Speaker 4:  getting a little more sensible as opposed to, I dunno, a couple years ago

271
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,280
Speaker 4:  when we're like, which way should the phones fold? And the answer is like

272
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,080
Speaker 4:  exactly one way and it's whatever Samsung wants, right? But now it's like,

273
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,960
Speaker 4:  oh this is a lot cooler. Like I can see this thing where it's like a

274
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,880
Speaker 4:  more compact than regular phone, but then you turn it sideways to watch a

275
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,480
Speaker 4:  YouTube video and the screen rolls out. That just rules like yeah

276
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,800
Speaker 4:  that's awesome. This

277
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,600
Speaker 1:  Feels like the phone that I would want to own. Unlike a lot of the Samsung

278
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,880
Speaker 1:  ones, the Samsung ones all feel like drawbacks. It's either like, okay you

279
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,440
Speaker 1:  have a little fat square that'll not fit in your pocket particularly well

280
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,320
Speaker 1:  or you have a really long skinny square that will not, you'll have a really

281
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,880
Speaker 1:  long skinny rectangle that won't fit in your pocket particularly well. And

282
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,800
Speaker 1:  this looks like it will fit a little better. Yeah. But also just be cooler

283
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,520
Speaker 1:  and you'll feel like a fancier person using

284
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,400
Speaker 5:  It. And I think that's where, where they're getting the, the wind kind of

285
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Speaker 5:  is that this feels like, this seems like something that will feel cool to

286
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,240
Speaker 5:  use. And they've brought back the razor, which was probably the coolest phone

287
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,960
Speaker 5:  of, of all time by by percentage of the phones that were available

288
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,720
Speaker 5:  versus the razor at that time. It was by far the coolest cooler

289
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,320
Speaker 5:  than anything else has ever been. The revamped foldable screen razor, which

290
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,200
Speaker 5:  they're going to bring out another device and might bring to the US hopefully

291
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,200
Speaker 5:  hasn't really recaptured that, but this rollable screen it, it kind of gets

292
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,920
Speaker 5:  there. Yeah.

293
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,000
Speaker 4:  So everyone is calling this thing the riser, which does not

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,560
Speaker 4:  appear to be its official name. Motorola is calling it the Motorola

295
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,240
Speaker 4:  Rollable, which is fine. I mean it rolls right off the tongue. Motorola,

296
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,880
Speaker 4:  yes, just try saying it. Hit pause on podcast right now and just go Motorola

297
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,720
Speaker 4:  rollable, look to your partner. Just say it. We'll

298
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,200
Speaker 1:  Wait right in the eye when you say

299
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,120
Speaker 4:  It. Motorola rollable, it's great and I love it. The riser is a cooler

300
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,000
Speaker 4:  name and so they should go with that. Then on top of that, as Richard

301
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Speaker 4:  was saying, Motorola did a couple years ago

302
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,400
Speaker 4:  put out a rebooted version of the razor phone, the classic

303
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,880
Speaker 4:  razor as a folding screen, mid-range Android phone.

304
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,480
Speaker 4:  Do y'all remember this? They went nuts with this launch. They influencer

305
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,960
Speaker 4:  parties, la the whole, they were like, we're back baby.

306
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,000
Speaker 4:  Everybody wants to flip open a razor and drive around in Miatas

307
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
Speaker 4:  or whatever. It's, they think the cool kids do and it just,

308
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,160
Speaker 4:  it flopped like total flopped. Like

309
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:42,960
Speaker 1:  It was a bad

310
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,240
Speaker 4:  Phone. I mean they ran into all the problems that every mid-range Android

311
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,480
Speaker 4:  phone runs into, which is the carriers loaded it with Bloatware. The processor

312
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,560
Speaker 4:  was slow, the camera was mediocre. It didn't have iMessage.

313
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,440
Speaker 5:  It was a Verizon exclusive at first, wasn't it?

314
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,400
Speaker 4:  I think so, yeah.

315
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,200
Speaker 5:  I hate to see it.

316
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,880
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's,

317
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,880
Speaker 1:  The display was kind of crummy on it too, if I remember correctly.

318
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,880
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it was just a bad phone. Yeah, like all the money was in the

319
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,560
Speaker 4:  folding and I don't think that they quite understood that

320
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,440
Speaker 4:  the target market for extremely fashionable phones also cares a lot about

321
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,350
Speaker 4:  iMessage, bump bump and then, and then you're like, oh, and the camera's

322
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,790
Speaker 4:  bad and the screen's a little shitty and the battery's not great. So they're

323
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,830
Speaker 4:  making a third version or Or you on three

324
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,350
Speaker 5:  I, yeah, I think so. I think this will be be number three or four. I, I don't

325
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,190
Speaker 5:  know. I don't know. I've lost count at this point. I

326
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,710
Speaker 4:  Just want to give you the quote from the CEO of Lenovo.

327
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,670
Speaker 4:  This is to cnbc, yang Wonking says to

328
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,790
Speaker 4:  cnbc, I think it's much better.

329
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,790
Speaker 1:  That's some confidence

330
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,270
Speaker 1:  he's willing to put go on the record saying that. That's real confidence.

331
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,030
Speaker 4:  How is the fuck? I think it's much better not, I know

332
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,150
Speaker 1:  Hedge is bats

333
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,670
Speaker 5:  That that's a real rim. We've got like two more blackberries to release

334
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,430
Speaker 5:  type of

335
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,830
Speaker 4:  Vibe. So then we went and asked Motorola

336
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,910
Speaker 4:  one Motorola officially refers to the CEO is yy.

337
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,790
Speaker 4:  Oh wow. Two Ys great. I mean that's, I can't get enough of that.

338
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,150
Speaker 4:  And then they said we're committed to foldable space

339
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,190
Speaker 4:  dedicated to expanding the Razor franchise soon. Stay tuned. So there is

340
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,910
Speaker 4:  another razor coming and the CEO of Lenovo thinks

341
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,030
Speaker 4:  it is much better.

342
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,990
Speaker 1:  Everyone invests that. That's, that's some like real optimism.

343
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,470
Speaker 4:  Yeah. What else happened at nbc Richard?

344
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,670
Speaker 5:  We saw other cool films. We saw Real me and I think they're

345
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,710
Speaker 5:  kind of corporate partners showing off phones that have really fast charging

346
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,430
Speaker 5:  240 wat fast charging in the real me GT three that you'll be able to buy

347
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,270
Speaker 5:  outside of China, although not in the us you'll be able to kind of plug

348
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,350
Speaker 5:  these phones and, and get half charge or full charging in just a few minutes.

349
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,950
Speaker 5:  And these are are real phones that people will actually be able to buy. Again,

350
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,750
Speaker 5:  not not where I live, but somewhere we saw one plus with

351
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,790
Speaker 5:  it, its active cooling phone that they say take several degrees

352
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,390
Speaker 5:  off. So when you're doing gaming on your phone, it won't overheat

353
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,670
Speaker 4:  And Trevor's always doing.

354
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,710
Speaker 5:  Of course it's a problem. Everyone, it's a problem we, we've all had and

355
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,950
Speaker 5:  they finally fixed it. They're launching a foldable later, later this year.

356
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,950
Speaker 5:  Honor has foldable. They they

357
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,910
Speaker 4:  Were just, this is what I mean about the technology is it's not mainstream,

358
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,790
Speaker 4:  it's just hit the part of the technology curve

359
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,870
Speaker 4:  where you can get it. Yeah. Right. And like that's an, it's just an important

360
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,990
Speaker 4:  thing to recognize. This is not limited to

361
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,470
Speaker 4:  a $2,100 Samsung flagship

362
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,950
Speaker 4:  concept phone. Now it's like, well you can just get it. So honor's gonna

363
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,470
Speaker 4:  make one and that's a, it is just, it's important to note that that's where

364
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,710
Speaker 4:  we are with these flexible screens.

365
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,670
Speaker 5:  And I think honors honors looks kind of cool that like you can have it sit,

366
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,230
Speaker 5:  you can use it partially folded. It looks, looks a little like the Motorola

367
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,550
Speaker 5:  mpx I'm saying they could put a physical keyboard on there.

368
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,230
Speaker 4:  It would be better. I see what you're saying.

369
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,400
Speaker 5:  We, we'll get there. But I, I think that was just the kind of the vibe of

370
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,760
Speaker 5:  the show that you had all of these different approaches. You can see the

371
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,960
Speaker 5:  technology coming and we'll, we'll have some, we'll have some of these other

372
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,480
Speaker 5:  things on phones that even, even we can use with this ridiculously fast charging

373
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,120
Speaker 5:  with more ways of using it. And I just want a riser that I can

374
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,880
Speaker 5:  roll up and, and unroll. Yeah,

375
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,760
Speaker 4:  It's so f well I want that too very badly. I'm very worried

376
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,720
Speaker 4:  that, you know, Lenovo's bar is, I think it will be much better. So

377
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,440
Speaker 4:  they're all concepts we have to see. I'm assuming it will have a

378
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,080
Speaker 4:  mid-range Qualcomm trip, a medium good screen and a bad camera.

379
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,000
Speaker 4:  This is the default for a mid-range generate phone. Now

380
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,960
Speaker 1:  They notably wouldn't let John like play with

381
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,680
Speaker 1:  No he the riser, right?

382
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think he could see it but he could not touch it himself.

383
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,560
Speaker 1:  Yeah, they wouldn't let him play with it and then he could still see like

384
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,200
Speaker 1:  the crease in the screen even from afar. So, Ooh,

385
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,160
Speaker 4:  That's so good.

386
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,200
Speaker 1:  We got some time.

387
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,080
Speaker 5:  There was the one accessory that we also saw more brand engineering

388
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,880
Speaker 5:  called Motorola, but made by this British company Bullet a Bluetooth

389
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,560
Speaker 5:  fob that you can use with your iPhone or your Android phone and you can get

390
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,240
Speaker 5:  something sort of like iPhone sos. Okay, with all, but

391
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,840
Speaker 5:  it's even better because you can also send messages, it connects to satellites.

392
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,920
Speaker 5:  You, you suddenly get that feature without having to buy a new phone.

393
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,960
Speaker 4:  It's only a hundred bucks,

394
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,360
Speaker 5:  Only a hundred bucks. The service isn't too expensive like 4 99 a month.

395
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,840
Speaker 5:  Whoever you're messaging does need to have this bullet company's app. But

396
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,000
Speaker 5:  it, it just kind of comes in and goes out as a regular SMS from you.

397
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,040
Speaker 4:  Wait, you need the other person needs the bullet app.

398
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,800
Speaker 5:  You can send them an SMS and they'll get it, but they'll get it and a link

399
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,680
Speaker 5:  to the app so that they can reply to you so they can, they can get your messages

400
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,280
Speaker 5:  but they can't send back without the app.

401
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,960
Speaker 4:  That is just something brutal growth hacking right there. It's like I'm trapped

402
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,280
Speaker 4:  on a mountain, I need you to download an app called Bullet.

403
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,200
Speaker 1:  Can you imagine sending that to like your partner who's not very

404
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,800
Speaker 1:  tech savvy and be like, help me save my life. And they're like, ah, I have

405
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
Speaker 1:  to log into the app store.

406
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Speaker 4:  Never. I don't know my iCloud password.

407
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,040
Speaker 1:  You just die like you're up on that mountain forever.

408
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,280
Speaker 4:  That's brutal. This should, it should come with a sticker on the box. It's

409
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,240
Speaker 4:  like you need a friend who knows their app store password. Make sure they

410
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,840
Speaker 4:  have face Eddie set up. All right, lastly on the M W C tip, Alex this is

411
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,560
Speaker 4:  your favorite. It's the other Lenovo thing. Yeah, it's the

412
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,000
Speaker 4:  laptop that goes into silly mode.

413
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,720
Speaker 1:  It's, he just goes whoop. He just goes straight up it looks like a normal

414
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,320
Speaker 1:  laptop and you're like, oh look at this little, this little 12 inch laptop.

415
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,280
Speaker 1:  What adorable thing. And then the screen slowly rises

416
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,760
Speaker 1:  from beneath from like the beneath the deck of the keyboard

417
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,440
Speaker 1:  and just gets taller and taller and then you got like two

418
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,560
Speaker 1:  screens stacked on top of each other.

419
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,520
Speaker 4:  It looks so silly. Go watch the video on the website. John did a great job

420
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,320
Speaker 4:  with this video, but you end up with two 16 by nine screens, right? Yeah.

421
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,560
Speaker 4:  Like stacked or at least that aspect ratio.

422
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,480
Speaker 1:  I just, I like Neil, I wanna have this like

423
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,280
Speaker 1:  in when next time we're doing the Verge cast and, and I have this, I wanna

424
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,520
Speaker 1:  be sitting across from you making eye contact and then you'll just watch

425
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Speaker 1:  me disappear as the screen slowly rises

426
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,280
Speaker 4:  So rude. Like the worst meeting etiquette is like boop

427
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,240
Speaker 4:  and the screen slowly rises up and covers your eye.

428
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,640
Speaker 5:  So it's two 16 by nine screens. So it would be perfectly sized for you to

429
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,120
Speaker 5:  be on a Zoom call while also watching Netflix if you wanted to do that.

430
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,720
Speaker 4:  Yes. And no one would know because you've raised the screen

431
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,720
Speaker 4:  so it looks like your eyes are still tracking where they were at the start

432
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,160
Speaker 4:  of the call.

433
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,080
Speaker 1:  Exactly.

434
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,960
Speaker 4:  You see what I'm saying? But you've, you've just gone,

435
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,560
Speaker 1:  I like, I think this is, this is brilliant. I want one tomorrow everybody.

436
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,440
Speaker 1:  I don't know what needs to happen to make this an actual viable product

437
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,320
Speaker 1:  that people buy, but the last few times Lenovo has

438
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,800
Speaker 1:  done something like this where they're like, look at this stupid thing and

439
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,240
Speaker 1:  you're like, that's stupid. Nobody will buy that. I want it. Then they go

440
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,800
Speaker 1:  and they make it.

441
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,240
Speaker 4:  Yes, that's what I'm saying Lenovo, this is Lenovo's thing now they're just

442
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,880
Speaker 4:  like, here it is.

443
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,920
Speaker 5:  And the last dual screen laptop was pretty good, wasn't it? I, I feel like

444
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,680
Speaker 5:  Monica said in the review, am I going too far?

445
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,040
Speaker 1:  That's generous. It wasn't horrible.

446
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,320
Speaker 5:  There we go.

447
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,440
Speaker 4:  Yes, Monica said it was actually good and quote shockingly

448
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,880
Speaker 4:  useful and then she said, as long as you're willing to pay $2,000 for it,

449
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,400
Speaker 4:  which I'm just gonna point out that in laptop world

450
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,600
Speaker 4:  is not a lot of money. She's like, it's shockingly useful for this

451
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,480
Speaker 4:  amount of money. Which again for high end laptop

452
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,080
Speaker 4:  is like the normal amount of money. So I think, I think there's a little

453
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,880
Speaker 4:  qualifier in there.

454
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,920
Speaker 1:  I wouldn't buy it but like I would respect other people who did. I don't

455
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,160
Speaker 1:  know if I'd respect them, but like I'd appreciate hanging out with them.

456
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I just love that Lenova does the stuff like they're the one company

457
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,400
Speaker 4:  now that I think reliably ships the wacky concepts,

458
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,280
Speaker 4:  the dual screen laptop with keyboard in the front. Come on. Who else is doing

459
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,960
Speaker 4:  that? You think Tim Cook is doing that? No. Samsung used to do that

460
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,080
Speaker 4:  now they're like, whatever, it's orange. That's as far as they go. Now I

461
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,680
Speaker 4:  appreciate that about Lenovo. That's what that's and that's what a trade

462
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,480
Speaker 4:  show is for. That's why we go to M W C. So like look at wild

463
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,560
Speaker 4:  stuff and think, okay, like five years from now, this might be the mainstream

464
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,550
Speaker 4:  thing. It's not because we think any of this will actually happen.

465
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,470
Speaker 4:  And I say this because I'm still scarred from when

466
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:57,190
Speaker 4:  Steve Bomber introduced Windows Mobile 6.5 with a honeycomb

467
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,510
Speaker 4:  app launcher and we were like, this is never gonna happen. And we were

468
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,390
Speaker 4:  inundated to the in Gadget comments four months saying that we were biased

469
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,110
Speaker 4:  in favor of Apple. Sorry, that was like 2007 and I'm still,

470
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,750
Speaker 4:  I told you so fully and I told you so

471
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,030
Speaker 4:  and now Noki is dead. That's what happened. There's a direct line from that

472
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,990
Speaker 4:  moment to whatever the Nokia logo is now.

473
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,790
Speaker 5:  That's your NFT moment. I I get it

474
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,990
Speaker 4:  Exactly Richard. I'm holding onto it forever. Alright, we gotta take a break

475
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,190
Speaker 4:  and come back. Alex Heath scooped the entire meta ar VR

476
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,270
Speaker 4:  hardware roadmap. We gotta talk about it. And then of course Elon

477
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,110
Speaker 4:  more stuff happened. We'll be right back.

502
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,030
Speaker 4:  We're back. Big scoop this week.

503
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:15,990
Speaker 1:  Big scoop.

504
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,750
Speaker 4:  Alex Heath Scoop machine Scooped met us so hard

505
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,750
Speaker 4:  that they talked about him in all hands meetings after the scoop. Yes. Which

506
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,110
Speaker 4:  is the funniest part of the whole puzzle. That's

507
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,990
Speaker 1:  When you know it's a good

508
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,230
Speaker 4:  Scoop. I can't tell you what I know, I just know that in many meetings at

509
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,070
Speaker 4:  meta after Alex scooped the roadmap, they talked

510
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,310
Speaker 4:  about Alex, which is very good, subscribe to Command line. I think he's gonna

511
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,430
Speaker 4:  have some of that gossip in command line this week. I was like, this is what

512
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,790
Speaker 4:  the people pay for. It's not the scoop, it's the gossip.

513
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,150
Speaker 1:  A hundred percent.

514
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,110
Speaker 4:  That's what I, that's what I pay for anyway. So Heath gets

515
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,830
Speaker 4:  the entire ar vr roadmap outta meta for the next four

516
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,150
Speaker 4:  years.

517
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,030
Speaker 1:  Along with like their insight, right? Like their insight into

518
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,710
Speaker 1:  why they're doing this and how they're gonna do

519
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,590
Speaker 4:  It. Yeah. And Meta has been through like I would say a weird period. They

520
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,790
Speaker 4:  laid a bunch of people off Mark Zuckerberg's under fire for focusing on the

521
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,950
Speaker 4:  Metaverse. The Quest Pro is behind me over there.

522
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,030
Speaker 4:  Haven't put that thing, has not been charged in in weeks and weeks. Now

523
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,870
Speaker 4:  Quest Pro came out, you know, lots of hype. Zuckerberg is like

524
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,750
Speaker 4:  doing virtual kickboxing with Joe Rogan trying to tell people the Metaverse

525
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,670
Speaker 4:  is here, the product is not good. The Quest two in my

526
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,350
Speaker 4:  opinion is a superior product. The Quest Pro a hundred percent because it's

527
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,350
Speaker 4:  more accessible, it's cheaper, it's just value for dollar, right? You get

528
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,870
Speaker 4:  more value for dollar in the Quest two than the Quest Pro

529
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,750
Speaker 4:  and then Horizon is just a mess, just a full

530
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,320
Speaker 4:  mess. And then Meta has layoffs in the advertising market. Sound apple's

531
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,200
Speaker 4:  like done the ad tracking transparency thing. Tough times from it all around.

532
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,120
Speaker 4:  So I think they were having this moment where the idea was we

533
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,840
Speaker 4:  have to re-really the troops around our ar vr

534
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,600
Speaker 4:  plans around reality labs, around the metaverse. So they have this like

535
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,080
Speaker 4:  roadmap presentation of AR and VR and what they're gonna do. And

536
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,120
Speaker 4:  importantly Alex, why they're doing it and where they think the money is

537
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,600
Speaker 4:  gonna come from.

538
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:08,680
Speaker 1:  It's fascinating. I, because I think we so often just get these

539
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,400
Speaker 1:  roadmaps, a lot of times when these kind of leaks happen, usually it's just

540
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,680
Speaker 1:  like, here's some documents showing the roadmap. And in this case we get

541
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,400
Speaker 1:  so much insight into what they're doing and their plans that I think

542
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,280
Speaker 1:  was really, really helpful. Even if it does showcase like an

543
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,840
Speaker 1:  optimism that I think is extraordinarily foolish.

544
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,680
Speaker 4:  Well, so let's start with the one piece of the puzzle that I think all of

545
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,440
Speaker 4:  us have been curious about. They said they have sold nearly

546
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,360
Speaker 4:  20 million Quest headsets to date. That's Quest one and Quest two, although

547
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,240
Speaker 4:  I think Quest two is the vast majority of that, that's not bad

548
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,280
Speaker 4:  for a games console.

549
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,440
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's like pretty solid.

550
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,440
Speaker 4:  Like the Nintendo Switch is the most popular console of all and I think it's

551
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,040
Speaker 4:  over a hundred million and that's where it is. Like we're so used to phone

552
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,680
Speaker 4:  numbers like apple's, like 95 billion iPhones

553
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,640
Speaker 4:  we're like that's the, but like the number for the Nintendo Switch, which

554
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,240
Speaker 4:  is now officially the third bestselling console of all time is

555
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,000
Speaker 4:  122.5 million. That's a lot. Obviously

556
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,800
Speaker 4:  far more than 20 million. But in context, I think we all thought that Quest

557
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,280
Speaker 4:  two or the Quest was smaller.

558
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,480
Speaker 5:  Well I think my question is kind of how does that break down among, among

559
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,280
Speaker 5:  the generations? But the Quest two unquestionably sold pretty well. The,

560
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,600
Speaker 5:  I know, I know a lot of people, we all kind of know people have seen them

561
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,560
Speaker 5:  around this past Christmas who got Quest two s, the 20 million

562
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,000
Speaker 5:  number. There are estimates that say the Xbox Series families around

563
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,320
Speaker 5:  20 million, that's a Fiji charts number if you know, you know, not exact,

564
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,800
Speaker 5:  not totally reliable but probably not that far off. So it, it's a decent

565
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,400
Speaker 5:  number for the hardware. But the thing that was in the article that

566
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,800
Speaker 5:  I kind of didn't understand is they're saying that the Quest three is going

567
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,760
Speaker 5:  to be at least a little bit more expensive. So how do you get people

568
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,600
Speaker 5:  to pay more? What exactly are they gonna put in it that people are going

569
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,240
Speaker 5:  to pay more for?

570
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,880
Speaker 4:  Right? Or are they gonna try to continue to grow the market, right? And say

571
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,800
Speaker 5:  They already raised the price of the quest too,

572
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,240
Speaker 4:  Right? The mean, this is like the classic problem. Like are you trying to

573
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,480
Speaker 4:  get everyone upgraded? You're trying to get 20 million people upgraded and

574
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,360
Speaker 4:  you think that your whole market is 20 million people or do you think the

575
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,960
Speaker 4:  market is a hundred million devices, you're gonna keep

576
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,840
Speaker 4:  supporting the Quest two and you're gonna go try to get the next 80 million

577
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,640
Speaker 4:  people with the Quest three i, I don't know, I I I think they don't know.

578
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,120
Speaker 1:  I don't know that you can get 20 million people or you know, another 20

579
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,800
Speaker 1:  80 million people whatever with the Crest three because it's more expensive.

580
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,760
Speaker 1:  The the, the get for the Quest two was its affordability.

581
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,360
Speaker 1:  It was that perfect blend, which is why I think they were talking in the

582
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,280
Speaker 1:  roadmap. There's plans for another device that's gonna be

583
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,480
Speaker 1:  cheaper, that's gonna hit that sweet spot while also kind of like

584
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,120
Speaker 1:  maximizing the VR capabilities.

585
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,120
Speaker 5:  I've heard this before, it was called the Sega Saturn in 32 x. I don't think

586
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,960
Speaker 5:  that worked out very well.

587
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,080
Speaker 4:  So here's a quote Meta says around the third year of Quest two and the

588
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,880
Speaker 4:  newer people that are coming in, the people who bought it this last Christmas,

589
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,560
Speaker 4:  they're not as into it as the ones who bought it early. Which kinda makes

590
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,960
Speaker 4:  sense, right? The early adopters are into it. The early adopters are gonna

591
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,080
Speaker 4:  use a lot. People get it as a Christmas gift. They're kind of going into

592
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,480
Speaker 4:  an ecosystem that is mature. Horizon is not the thing,

593
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,800
Speaker 4:  it's games like the thing is a games console that need great games every

594
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,240
Speaker 4:  season. I don't think the Quest had great games. So the Quest this year,

595
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,320
Speaker 4:  so the Quest three is gonna hit with 41 new apps and

596
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,280
Speaker 4:  games including some new mixed reality stuff. There's gonna be pass through

597
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,920
Speaker 4:  that works really well. This is the mainstream headset that's coming.

598
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,400
Speaker 4:  What I would put around the, the context I would put around that 20 million

599
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,120
Speaker 4:  number is Microsoft sells 20 million of the Xbox

600
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,520
Speaker 4:  Series consoles and they're like, this is a great

601
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,560
Speaker 4:  business. We sell a ton of games, people love this thing. We should buy Activision

602
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,480
Speaker 4:  because people are buying games and subscribing to Xbox Live. And

603
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,440
Speaker 4:  they're right. They, they monetize that so well Meta is like the new people

604
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,520
Speaker 4:  who buy this aren't even like using it as much. So that entire

605
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,640
Speaker 4:  secondary ecosystem that you need to make money off of this device does not

606
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,400
Speaker 4:  yet exist for meta.

607
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,160
Speaker 5:  One thing that we've seen that they maybe are trying to expand that the Battle

608
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,440
Speaker 5:  royal game, what is that population one or, or maybe I I'm maybe in a different

609
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,320
Speaker 5:  way. Yeah they're making that free to play like games on other consoles are,

610
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,280
Speaker 5:  which is one approach we saw. Obviously Fortnite is the biggest example,

611
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,120
Speaker 5:  but that's one way that you can kind of onboard people onto it. You can say

612
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,960
Speaker 5:  okay look, you get the headset, you can just play it with your friends who

613
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,720
Speaker 5:  are playing it. You don't have to buy another thing. And then of course you

614
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,880
Speaker 5:  start spending money on the in-game cosmetics and

615
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,760
Speaker 1:  Whatnot. I think we're seeing like Meta's misunderstanding of

616
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,440
Speaker 1:  what their audience is. Cuz Meta's so focused on building the metaverse

617
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,440
Speaker 1:  and getting every single person you knows into the metaverse, they

618
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,160
Speaker 1:  forgot that they've just really built a really good game console and they're

619
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,760
Speaker 1:  in the video game business and they need to be doing what

620
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,400
Speaker 1:  Sony and Microsoft and Nintendo do, which is focused on making really good

621
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,520
Speaker 1:  games. And instead they're like, no, no, no, we're gonna go and we're gonna

622
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,240
Speaker 1:  do the Quest three. And yeah it'll be a little more more expensive but it's

623
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,120
Speaker 1:  gonna blow your socks off. And as we saw saw happen with Sega as we saw happen

624
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,000
Speaker 1:  with the PS three, those tend to be kind of like, if

625
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,880
Speaker 1:  not Boondoggles, certainly not successes. Wait

626
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,600
Speaker 4:  To PS three was a huge success.

627
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,280
Speaker 5:  Was it? They lost a lot of ground to Xbox that generation. That was the one

628
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,960
Speaker 5:  generation, the Xbox won, it

629
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,680
Speaker 4:  Still grew the market for games. Like

630
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,160
Speaker 1:  It grew the market F for games, but it didn't grow like

631
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,240
Speaker 1:  the people going and buying the PS three already owned a PS

632
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,160
Speaker 1:  two. It wasn't, it wasn't like a whole new audience. And Meta's right

633
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,640
Speaker 1:  now needs to be building a whole new audience and instead they're like, no,

634
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,520
Speaker 1:  no, no, we want to just go build cool hardware, which I as a hardware

635
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,680
Speaker 1:  lover I respect, but

636
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,440
Speaker 4:  Like I'm gonna make a different comparison for you. I don't think the PS

637
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,640
Speaker 4:  two is right comparison. And it

638
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,280
Speaker 5:  Got better once they revised it and made it not look like a foreman grill.

639
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,200
Speaker 5:  And then they started selling more when they made a slim and they made it

640
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,520
Speaker 5:  cheaper.

641
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,680
Speaker 4:  I have, I have the one that you can run Lennox on and I same, you know,

642
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,480
Speaker 1:  Oh man, you can kill someone with that thing. It's huge.

643
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,520
Speaker 4:  It's huge. It was heavy, it was hot, it was ridiculous. The whole thing.

644
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,360
Speaker 4:  I fine and people can argue about with me about whether PS three was a huge

645
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,240
Speaker 4:  success or not. Whatever. I'll make the same comparison,

646
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,400
Speaker 4:  the same point you're making Alex, I agree with you. The better one

647
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,560
Speaker 4:  is the Xbox One where Microsoft was like, here's what we did.

648
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,480
Speaker 4:  We made a Windows PC for your living room that you can play games on

649
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,480
Speaker 4:  and now we're gonna talk about how much of a Windows PC it is. By the way,

650
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:20,440
Speaker 4:  it also has an IR plaster to control your cable box. And everyone's like,

651
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,760
Speaker 4:  where's the games? And they're like, no, no, don't you wanna run windows

652
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,160
Speaker 4:  in your living room? And that was a disaster.

653
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,120
Speaker 1:  That's a good

654
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,160
Speaker 4:  Point, right? Like that's where Microsoft lost all the ground where they

655
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,440
Speaker 4:  had the, remember that E three where they talked about everything, the video

656
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:31,760
Speaker 4:  games,

657
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,120
Speaker 1:  Everybody was so mad.

658
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,520
Speaker 4:  People were mad except, and the people who were mad at where the people who

659
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,520
Speaker 4:  are mad at me, this is just show me airing old grievances. This is the best

660
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,920
Speaker 4:  episode for her chest ever made. I was like nothing with an i blaster ever

661
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,080
Speaker 4:  works and never got mad at me. You know, whatever. But that was right.

662
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,960
Speaker 1:  The Nvidia Shield, that first one had an IR blaster and now we're on

663
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
Speaker 1:  what? Fifth gen

664
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,640
Speaker 4:  Boom. And boy has the Nvidia Shield taken the world by storm. There

665
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,120
Speaker 5:  Will be 17 revisions of De Quest three before they kind of get it right.

666
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:58,880
Speaker 5:  Probably.

667
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying is the, the exact point Alex is making, she

668
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,240
Speaker 4:  you're correct is when you make it a game console and you make it

669
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,480
Speaker 4:  great, people buy it, they love it, they're gonna play it more. When you

670
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,240
Speaker 4:  start to be like, it's also a general purpose computer.

671
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,280
Speaker 4:  And this is true the Quest two, right now, if you open it up, it wants you

672
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,440
Speaker 4:  to do things other than play games. It's like, sign into your Facebook account,

673
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,400
Speaker 4:  here's this new thing. We've, we've added multi window support.

674
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,400
Speaker 4:  I don't wanna do any of this stuff man. I'm just, I'm gonna play NFL

675
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,240
Speaker 4:  Pro era. I'm gonna be bad at being quarterback for a while and then I'm gonna

676
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,160
Speaker 4:  put this down and like that's all you want out of it. My PS five is not like,

677
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,680
Speaker 4:  oh you're interested in grand. Have you thought about opening web browser?

678
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,400
Speaker 4:  It's like, no, like stop. And I think this is the

679
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,080
Speaker 4:  challenge that Meta has with the Quest two, which they're trying to

680
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,920
Speaker 4:  expand, but going Quest two to Quest, read a Quest Pro, it's a

681
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,760
Speaker 4:  replacement for your laptop. This is the next generation of computing devices.

682
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,520
Speaker 4:  I I think it's a bigger gap because people like, they

683
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,040
Speaker 4:  think that games machines are an appliance. Yeah. Right? They're

684
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,080
Speaker 4:  even if the chips and some of the software is all the same as a general

685
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,000
Speaker 4:  purpose computer, they're still like appliances and that they are supposed

686
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,360
Speaker 4:  to do a job and then you're supposed to go away. Now I know there's people

687
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,160
Speaker 4:  right there right now talking, they're like already they're in

688
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,480
Speaker 4:  chat Chief PT being like, write an angry email about my Windows PC that I

689
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,880
Speaker 4:  play games on. I understand. I'm just saying that these devices,

690
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,000
Speaker 1:  It's Tom Warren. Tom Warren is doing that at Sweet Speed,

691
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,440
Speaker 5:  But what, what do they have lined up after that? So, so where do we go from

692
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,920
Speaker 5:  there? I guess we, we've got years of, of data of what, what meta is going

693
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Speaker 5:  to do. What, what do they do next after the de quests

694
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Speaker 4:  Three. So that's the Quest line, that's the VR side of this, right? They're

695
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,680
Speaker 4:  gonna Quest three and then at some point there's a new Quest

696
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,120
Speaker 4:  Pro they talked about they that's a, that that's like a weird product. I

697
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,880
Speaker 4:  think they gotta figure that out. They didn't talk about that very much.

698
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,240
Speaker 4:  The real stuff and this is like the battle with Apple that's

699
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,120
Speaker 4:  coming is the AR glasses. So we are expecting

700
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,920
Speaker 4:  some sort of mixed reality headset from Apple this year

701
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,760
Speaker 4:  and we're expecting a virtual reality headset with cameras. It does pass

702
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,000
Speaker 4:  through. That's mixed reality. Very expensive.

703
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,760
Speaker 4:  $3,000 an app from Apple Developer tool. I think we're expecting it around

704
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,600
Speaker 4:  wwc, this is the rumor, I don't know anything about this. This is what the

705
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,120
Speaker 4:  people say Meta is doing something very different. So in

706
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,880
Speaker 4:  2025 they're gonna release a new set of smart glasses. Like the, like the

707
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,560
Speaker 4:  ones they've already released with Ray bands that just sort of like have

708
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,240
Speaker 4:  a screen in them. You know, like you can get notifications.

709
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,880
Speaker 1:  So like what North was doing there for a while before they got sucked up

710
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,360
Speaker 1:  by the Google machine.

711
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:39,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think the current ones, they just like take photos, they

712
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,880
Speaker 4:  don't like do anything. You know it's like it's got a camera in it.

713
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,520
Speaker 1:  Yeah all the all the, the Ray bands just take pictures and gras you took

714
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,400
Speaker 1:  some pictures with your,

715
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,880
Speaker 4:  When I think of things I trust Mark Zuckerberg with, it's putting a camera

716
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,960
Speaker 4:  on my face that other people can't see a hundred percent. See so the, the

717
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,760
Speaker 4:  next generation in 2025, we'll just have a screen in the

718
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,280
Speaker 4:  lens and you'll be able to get notifications like

719
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,000
Speaker 4:  the, they called it a view finder. You like incoming text messages, scan

720
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,440
Speaker 4:  QR codes, translate text from one thing to another. This is like everyone's

721
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:07,800
Speaker 4:  favorite demo.

722
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,160
Speaker 1:  And what's the other thing they're gonna have?

723
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,060
Speaker 4:  They're gonna have a smartwatch that controls it

724
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,900
Speaker 4:  using a neural interface, which is tech that meta has had

725
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,500
Speaker 4:  and that they have demoed before Addie has seen this technology. She loves

726
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,340
Speaker 4:  it. She thinks it's so cool. She was very worried when Meta's gonna last.

727
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,260
Speaker 4:  They're gonna get rid of this. But they're betting on it that instead of

728
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,700
Speaker 4:  this thing right now where there's a bunch of cameras on a headset and you

729
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,780
Speaker 4:  like wave your hands around and do pinching motions, they're gonna be able

730
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,140
Speaker 4:  to put a a like a smart watch on your wrist that will detect what your hand

731
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,620
Speaker 4:  is doing. Which is, it's just cool. Like they have the technology, they've

732
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,380
Speaker 4:  demoed it well

733
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,620
Speaker 1:  They were gonna do the watch for a while and then the watch got killed. Cuz

734
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,420
Speaker 1:  everybody was like, nobody wants a Facebook branded smartwatch

735
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,060
Speaker 1:  on their wrist. Even if it does do the neural stuff.

736
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,020
Speaker 4:  The entire underlying thing here, not to make this whole thing about Apple,

737
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,620
Speaker 4:  but the entire underlying thing here is Mark Zuckerberg knows

738
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:02,820
Speaker 4:  that his company is at Apple's Mercy. And we've seen

739
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,580
Speaker 4:  it now several times. Like Apple pulls a security certificate, all of Facebook's

740
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,660
Speaker 4:  internal systems stop working. Apple decides it wants ad tracking transparency

741
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,500
Speaker 4:  puts up the prompt. People say no, Facebook's business goes away.

742
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,180
Speaker 4:  Mark Zuckerberg knows he's at the mercy of apples. So if you wanna make a

743
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,980
Speaker 4:  smartwatch and you're like, you cannot reply any texts on it on your

744
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,460
Speaker 4:  phone like you're done for, there's a reason there are no competitive

745
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,980
Speaker 4:  smartwatches on iOS because Apple restricts all the good

746
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,940
Speaker 4:  capabilities to its own platform. Fine. We argue about

747
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,800
Speaker 4:  that, that whether or not that's right Elizabeth Warren is gonna like jump

748
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,320
Speaker 4:  through a wall like the Kool-Aid man screaming about interrupt whatever.

749
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,120
Speaker 4:  Mark Zuckerberg knows that this is the current state of things. So he's gotta

750
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,640
Speaker 4:  build a new platform. Yeah. And so building a wa a smartwatch that's like

751
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,800
Speaker 4:  still dependent Apple. I don't think he's interested in that. So he is like,

752
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,160
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna build a headset. The headset, you're gonna live in the headset,

753
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,960
Speaker 4:  you're gonna brain in a vat, you're gonna post Instagram all day. I'm gonna

754
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,800
Speaker 4:  read your thoughts and we're going to move your laptop into this headset

755
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,200
Speaker 4:  and now I've got this smartwatch that is the control surface for the headset

756
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,880
Speaker 4:  instead of doing camera-based keyboard stuff or

757
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,120
Speaker 4:  controller based stuff. I think this is the coolest idea they have because

758
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,640
Speaker 4:  everything we know about Apple is that Apple is gonna do the camera-based,

759
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,880
Speaker 4:  you know, pinch in the air situation. Now it's Apple.

760
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,400
Speaker 4:  They'll probably do a better job than what we've seen in the past, but that's

761
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,680
Speaker 4:  what we know so far. So that is the coolest part is like they're gonna do

762
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,440
Speaker 4:  these smart glasses, they're not AR glasses, just sunglasses or the screen

763
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,160
Speaker 4:  that do notifications and then this control system, well

764
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,600
Speaker 1:  They'll have a view finder, they'll, they'll have like that, that limited

765
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,640
Speaker 1:  range that is already capable of in other

766
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Speaker 1:  glasses. Because I think that's the thing that I keep getting focused on

767
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,120
Speaker 1:  in with ar, we all have our little bits where we're like, AR can't happen

768
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,880
Speaker 1:  until this happens because there's so much stuff that has to happen first.

769
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,720
Speaker 1:  And for me, I always get hung up on the like, how are you gonna use these?

770
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,360
Speaker 1:  What's, what's the, what's the technology behind the sway? And

771
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,080
Speaker 1:  in this case it sounds like they're gonna be using kind of robust

772
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,240
Speaker 1:  technology that already exists, which is those little like tiny

773
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,160
Speaker 1:  lasers in reflective, the whole reflective apparatus

774
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,800
Speaker 1:  that North does.

775
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:09,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah, we'll see, just to like define the terms here again, when we talk about

776
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,200
Speaker 4:  ar, it's, I think what you and I are talking about is

777
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,880
Speaker 4:  you look through a pair of glasses, you have like perfect field of view.

778
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,160
Speaker 4:  The glasses, see that you're looking at a tree and you get like the little

779
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,840
Speaker 4:  label that's like pine tree, right? Yeah. By the way, huge problems with

780
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,480
Speaker 4:  this. Especially if you live in the world of Facebook content moderation.

781
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,760
Speaker 4:  Imagine that you're standing Washington DC and you're looking at the capitol

782
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,960
Speaker 4:  building who gets to label the capitol building what happened at the

783
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,520
Speaker 4:  capitol building, any notable events that your uncle on

784
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,080
Speaker 4:  Facebook might like to notate around that building

785
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,120
Speaker 4:  the content moderation nightmare to end all content moderation.

786
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,720
Speaker 4:  Nightmares.

787
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,960
Speaker 1:  I just got like tired thinking about it.

788
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,000
Speaker 4:  It's exhausting and no one's ready for it. Who will, who will augment reality?

789
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,160
Speaker 4:  A real question that's a real headline we should put on the site, but that's

790
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,640
Speaker 4:  like the holy grail, like Mark Zuckerberg is called this holy grail I, I've

791
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,560
Speaker 4:  said this a a million times in the show. If I could just remember people's

792
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,520
Speaker 4:  names, I'd be the King of America that you couldn't stop me. Unstoppable,

793
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,720
Speaker 4:  charming, a charm. The dedication, the memory that I, I remember your

794
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,560
Speaker 4:  kid's names. I'd be like an unstoppable politician as it

795
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,640
Speaker 4:  stands. I can't remember, I can't remember anyone's names. So all of you

796
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,520
Speaker 4:  are safe for my reign of tear. But these glasses, the problem is you

797
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,960
Speaker 4:  have to build a worldwide facial recognition database to enable that feature.

798
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,680
Speaker 4:  Again, not something I'm sure we want Mark Zuckerberg to

799
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,280
Speaker 1:  Do. I think he's already done it, but yeah.

800
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,800
Speaker 4:  Well I'll be unstoppable. Yeah, you, you can't touch me.

801
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,080
Speaker 1:  Who cares about privacy? I know who all of you are, I know

802
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,720
Speaker 1:  your names

803
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,160
Speaker 4:  But Patel, this is like an interim step. Like that's the dream

804
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,960
Speaker 4:  and that's what we think Apple is building towards. This is like, it's a

805
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,240
Speaker 4:  pair of sunglasses and it's got a little display in it.

806
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,400
Speaker 1:  It's like Google Glass display.

807
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's a little monitor in your glasses and it, it can do things like

808
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,160
Speaker 4:  show you a notification and it sounds like it'll have a camera still.

809
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,160
Speaker 4:  So it can do things like take a picture of a sign in a foreign

810
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,080
Speaker 4:  language and then like show you what that text means. It does not appear

811
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,000
Speaker 4:  that they're talking about you can overlay or augment reality

812
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,800
Speaker 4:  with that screen. Right? We don't quite know. But it doesn't seem like

813
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,280
Speaker 4:  that's the case. Which is interesting because Apple's product is that thing.

814
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,880
Speaker 4:  They're gonna jump right there this year and this Facebook smart glasses

815
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,600
Speaker 4:  is 2025 now Facebook is then gonna do its first true pair of

816
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,400
Speaker 4:  AR glasses code named Orion internal launch in

817
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,960
Speaker 4:  2024. So next year and then a public version in 2027.

818
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,080
Speaker 4:  So we'll see. That's a long way out from Apple.

819
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,320
Speaker 5:  And this is what we're talking about, like it overlays holograms onto the

820
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,120
Speaker 5:  real world, like the demos that that Mark showed off.

821
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,040
Speaker 1:  No, cuz cuz Apple's thing, Apple's still doing pass through. The problem

822
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,800
Speaker 1:  is nobody's figured out the display technology to actually do ar.

823
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,920
Speaker 1:  So the hack right now is to be like, look like a

824
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,760
Speaker 1:  wiener, wear a giant headset on your face and the cameras will pass it through

825
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,080
Speaker 1:  and process the information. So like that's Apple's plan

826
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:04,360
Speaker 1:  for the foreseeable future. And no, you're not seeing, the thing is there's

827
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,760
Speaker 1:  not a lot of movement in the display technology space to suggest that something

828
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,560
Speaker 1:  cooler is on their horizon, right? Like you would normally hear little

829
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,680
Speaker 1:  trick, you'd hear little bits of that at like C graph and other places

830
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,000
Speaker 1:  and we're not hearing that yet. So it's just like, okay, this

831
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,720
Speaker 1:  big breakthrough that we need to happen for true AR hasn't happened and

832
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,480
Speaker 1:  everybody's like finding hacky ways into it.

833
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,800
Speaker 4:  Somewhere there's like a wave guide engineer listening to Alex right now,

834
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,040
Speaker 4:  like shaking his fist, being like, I'll show you. But

835
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,320
Speaker 5:  That's what they're promising with this Orion thing is that they're gonna

836
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,840
Speaker 5:  do these high quality holograms

837
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,080
Speaker 4:  In 2027. Orion will do the high quality ar

838
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,880
Speaker 4:  that's, that's Meta's roadmap, that's their projection for when

839
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,680
Speaker 4:  they'll do it, allegedly. We'll see. And they'll have an internal prototype

840
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,360
Speaker 4:  in 24. So next year. So between their internal prototype

841
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,400
Speaker 4:  and actually consumer launches on this roadmap, three years,

842
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,480
Speaker 5:  I'll just write a stub for the internal tests have been delayed until

843
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,600
Speaker 5:  2025 right now and just get that ready.

844
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,240
Speaker 4:  But Alex, you're right that that stack of problems is really hard, right?

845
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,160
Speaker 4:  If you, and, and we've gone through it many times on the show, but I'll do

846
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,040
Speaker 4:  it one more time. It's you need glasses on your face. The

847
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,960
Speaker 4:  glasses have to contain a camera, enough cameras to see the world around

848
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,840
Speaker 4:  you. You have to pass all the information from the camera onto a

849
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,840
Speaker 4:  computer that can recognize what you're looking at. Go out to the internet,

850
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,920
Speaker 4:  figure out what it's, what it is you're seeing, figure out what to

851
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,680
Speaker 4:  augment reality with, send it back to you and it will like

852
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,480
Speaker 4:  zero latency or process all that locally. You

853
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,360
Speaker 4:  need a battery that can run all this all day

854
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,440
Speaker 4:  and you need a display that's thin and optically transparent

855
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,760
Speaker 4:  enough so that they're just glasses and you're not like,

856
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,800
Speaker 1:  Yeah, with a large enough field of view that it feels like

857
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,360
Speaker 1:  reality's being augmented and a post stamp isn't.

858
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah, this is not a solved problem. Like every part of

859
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,280
Speaker 4:  that is 0% solved, well maybe not zero.

860
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,800
Speaker 4:  Every part of that is way less than 50% solved. Like even the part where

861
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,720
Speaker 4:  it's like you want to go out to the cloud computing center and

862
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,240
Speaker 4:  like identify the tree and send it back to you at zero latency. That was

863
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,360
Speaker 4:  the whole point of 5g. And like, does

864
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,520
Speaker 4:  anyone wanna trust that to the current state of 5G networks?

865
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:20,040
Speaker 4:  I was in New York City last week. I pulled 35 down on at and t 5G plus.

866
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,840
Speaker 4:  Ooh, you were not allowed to augment reality. Like that is just, it's already

867
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Speaker 4:  a horrible experience.

868
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,800
Speaker 5:  There's something coming for that. Stay tuned. We, we will have, we will

869
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,120
Speaker 5:  have a report. There's something coming that, that may be like 40% solved.

870
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,160
Speaker 4:  The 5G

871
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,920
Speaker 5:  Part? No, the the latency part. It's, it, it's not 5g unfortunately, which

872
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,680
Speaker 5:  did not do what we promised.

873
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,520
Speaker 4:  Is it Comcast 10 G?

874
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,160
Speaker 5:  Maybe

875
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,640
Speaker 5:  it's not, not Comcast 10 G

876
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:51,840
Speaker 4:  Disclosure, NBC Universalist and Investor in VMedia. Our

877
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,360
Speaker 4:  parent company Comcast owns nbc. They don't love me.

878
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,280
Speaker 4:  Comcast been super thirsty with the 10 G marketing lately. Have

879
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,760
Speaker 4:  you noticed this?

880
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,360
Speaker 5:  Yes. It's And 10 G if you were wondering what it stands for, it is more than

881
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:03,760
Speaker 5:  5g.

882
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:06,440
Speaker 1:  Skip for

883
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,640
Speaker 4:  It ahead. You know you love the convenience of the mobile internet.

884
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,800
Speaker 4:  Have you thought about faster internet with wires? It's good. I'll

885
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,600
Speaker 4:  take it. I'll take it Liam, I think Are you upgrading to, to two gig

886
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,360
Speaker 4:  internet home? I know you're talking about it.

887
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,400
Speaker 8:  Still thinking

888
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,120
Speaker 4:  About it the second I can, I'm doing it. I don't care what you say.

889
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:26,680
Speaker 8:  I can't even use all of what I have now, but I kind of wanna be a monster

890
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,080
Speaker 8:  and just say I have a two gigabit internet connection.

891
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,040
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Do you know how many horsepower your car actually needs? It's like

892
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,120
Speaker 4:  50. Has that stopped anyone in America?

893
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,520
Speaker 5:  When you look at the horsepower of cars from the nineties, like what a probe

894
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,400
Speaker 5:  turbo came with compared to what everything has now.

895
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,640
Speaker 5:  It's like a joke. But I, I recently cut the cord. I, I got in touch with

896
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,600
Speaker 5:  Comcast and they had to kick TiVo one more time on the way out. I asked them

897
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,480
Speaker 5:  what I needed to do with my cable card and they said, oh, we don't, we don't

898
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,600
Speaker 5:  get a lot of questions about those.

899
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:57,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Wow. You saw the cable card. What was your cable

900
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,520
Speaker 4:  card plugged into

901
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,240
Speaker 5:  A TiVo.

902
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:03,800
Speaker 4:  Oh man. This is is like the greatest hits vergecast right now. We've

903
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,080
Speaker 4:  dunked on Windows Mobile,

904
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,800
Speaker 4:  got TiVo on the show. Richard's debugging and a cable card

905
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:13,360
Speaker 4:  that was super right about when mobile. I just wanna put that out. I are

906
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:13,800
Speaker 4:  blasters.

907
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,320
Speaker 1:  We're gonna talk about boxing next. Let's go.

908
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,320
Speaker 4:  We gotta take a break. We're gonna come back. We gotta talk about Elon. We

909
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,240
Speaker 4:  gotta talk about ai. There's, there's still much to discuss and we're gonna

910
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,000
Speaker 4:  do it all by controlling the British cast with our, our neural smart bands.

911
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,860
Speaker 9:  It's late. You're almost home after catching that concert you and your friend

912
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,780
Speaker 9:  snag tickets to with MX months ago. You're all speechless from the last

913
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,940
Speaker 9:  hour spent singing your hearts out. And the only thing playing in the car

914
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,940
Speaker 9:  is the last song of the night on a full blast in your head.

915
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:53,700
Speaker 9:  Admit it. You want it stuck there. The live version you can't get

916
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,540
Speaker 9:  anywhere else. Looks like you're getting goosebumps all over again.

917
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:01,500
Speaker 9:  When the Knight's a hit, that's when you're with amex. American Express.

918
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,860
Speaker 9:  Don't live life without it.

919
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,940
Speaker 10:  The world looks different behind the handlebars of a rat Electric lake.

920
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:11,300
Speaker 10:  Grabbing takeout looks less like greasy styrofoam boxes and more like

921
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,260
Speaker 10:  a cross town adventure ride shares look less like piling into the back

922
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,980
Speaker 10:  of a car and more like grabbing fresh air with your friends and

923
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,820
Speaker 10:  commuting can even start to look like the best part of your day.

924
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,330
Speaker 10:  That's because with Rad the world is what you make of it. Not what it makes

Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. We've promised Liam and ourselves that we

928
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,660
Speaker 4:  will get through this week in Elon quickly so we can talk about

929
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,020
Speaker 4:  ai.

930
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,020
Speaker 1:  This is self-care.

931
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,860
Speaker 4:  This is self-care. There's a lot of Elon news but kind of like

932
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,260
Speaker 4:  none of it matters. Like I don't know how else to describe that

933
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,980
Speaker 1:  Alex. I think on, on the clock of Alex winning her bet

934
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,820
Speaker 1:  against Monica and Liz, I think I'm, I'm

935
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,580
Speaker 1:  much closer to winning the bad now cuz he, he was doing

936
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,260
Speaker 1:  some like a plus shit posting this week.

937
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:10,580
Speaker 4:  He was tweeting, replies to people arguing about the war in Ukraine

938
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,780
Speaker 4:  during Tesla Investor Day. He was backstage

939
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,460
Speaker 4:  at his own investor day replying to randos on Twitter.

940
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,380
Speaker 1:  I'm just saying, I'm so sorry it's gonna happen. I'm gonna get a coffee

941
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,380
Speaker 1:  and a bottle of champagne and the rest of you are just gonna have some nightmares

942
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,980
Speaker 1:  in your head forever.

943
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:31,460
Speaker 4:  I very much like not acknowledging what the be is. People can just guess

944
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,740
Speaker 4:  what it is. You can guess it's fine. All right, let's go through the Elon

945
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,940
Speaker 4:  headlines. He laid off more people over the weekend, including Esther

946
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,140
Speaker 4:  Crawford, who is a woman who very famously was sleeping on the ground and

947
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,700
Speaker 4:  was gonna be like the head of Twitter blues product. She got laid off along

948
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,460
Speaker 4:  with a bunch of other founders from companies Twitter had acquired who had

949
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,660
Speaker 4:  accelerating vesting schedules, bigger payouts because of their stock and

950
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,140
Speaker 4:  so on. More cleaning house. He apologized, he said it was

951
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,060
Speaker 4:  necessary Twitter financially quite dicey. Like we don't know

952
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,620
Speaker 4:  what's going on there. There's a lot of rumors that he's picked a new ceo,

953
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,140
Speaker 4:  the ceo Esther Crawford slept on the floor by herself in Sleeping Bag.

954
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,020
Speaker 4:  The guy, they think it'll be the new CEO Twitter, he just moved in with his

955
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,940
Speaker 4:  wife and newborn baby and is sleeping there. Oof. So that's

956
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,540
Speaker 4:  the level of commitment that Elon's looking for is does your family sleep

957
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,500
Speaker 4:  here as well? We'll see. Twitter has gone down a lot recently.

958
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,320
Speaker 4:  It's been very slow. Errors are spiking. The main timeline just like

959
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,040
Speaker 4:  didn't work this week. Twitter also shut off its internal slack and

960
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,040
Speaker 4:  employees went over a day without working. Just all fully

961
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,840
Speaker 4:  ridiculous. Then all the things that we thought would happen

962
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,760
Speaker 4:  when Elon bought Twitter have like started to happen. And I don't

963
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,320
Speaker 4:  mean the, he fired everybody and the site's not reliable. We didn't actually

964
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,280
Speaker 4:  predict that part of it. We predicted a bunch of moderation, crises and that

965
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,040
Speaker 4:  is beginning to happen as well. So there was a report under the Department

966
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,440
Speaker 4:  of Energy that the Department of Energy with low confidence has Deduced

967
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,520
Speaker 4:  has decided that Covid leaked out of a lab in Wuhan

968
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,680
Speaker 4:  China. That's obviously, there's discrepancy with what the Department of

969
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,160
Speaker 4:  Energy thinks compared other parts of the government. This is an ongoing

970
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,760
Speaker 4:  debate in a scientific community. Elon tweets about it

971
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:14,040
Speaker 4:  gets reprimanded in Chinese state media that says don't bite the hands

972
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,840
Speaker 4:  that Fiji in using a Chinese idiom. There's a huge problem. Freelan

973
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,680
Speaker 4:  China is a huge market for Tesla. Like he's gotta keep that in

974
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,600
Speaker 4:  check or leave China, right? Like the same way that, I dunno, the

975
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,240
Speaker 4:  NBA gets in trouble for Cow Island in China. Like Elon's got the same problem

976
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:33,520
Speaker 4:  only now he owns Twitter and he's addicted to it and he loves owning the

977
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,280
Speaker 4:  lips. This is the problem.

978
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:39,200
Speaker 1:  He has no one to just say no before that it was the moderators

979
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,520
Speaker 1:  at Twitter and he fired them

980
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,840
Speaker 5:  All. Well he had a response to the s e c. He, he like, he wanted to try and

981
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,400
Speaker 5:  make up a little acronym for them and he's, he's complained and complained

982
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,800
Speaker 5:  and complained about their restrictions on his tweeting. I feel like that's

983
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,280
Speaker 5:  not gonna go over well with the Chinese government.

984
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,080
Speaker 4:  Feel like it's not gonna go over well with the Chinese government. So that's

985
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,040
Speaker 4:  Twitter. So just escalating chaos at Twitter, including now some of the problems

986
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,560
Speaker 4:  that we thought we would see. And then there's investor day

987
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,600
Speaker 4:  which was, we are recording this on Thursday. You're listening to it on Friday.

988
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:11,000
Speaker 4:  We all watched investor day on Wednesday night. It was very long. It was

989
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,160
Speaker 4:  four hours long. I will say Elon's deputies at Tesla

990
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,400
Speaker 4:  by and large, all very polished, all very put together, very committed, very

991
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,920
Speaker 4:  passionate Elon looking like he just showed up off the street like

992
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:25,400
Speaker 4:  just ram like rambling. Like they kept dragging him out there to be like,

993
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,080
Speaker 4:  not Elon's gonna talk about robots. And he'd be like, here's a render of

994
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,920
Speaker 4:  optimist. And he'd say something like, yeah I think it's pretty important

995
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:33,800
Speaker 4:  this could change the economy. And then he would look off into the distance

996
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,480
Speaker 4:  and say, what does economy even mean? And then everyone would politely clap

997
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,760
Speaker 4:  and then they would like bring out the head of supply chain to be like, here's

998
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,080
Speaker 4:  how we're gonna make more cars. But overall it was four hours they announced

999
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,760
Speaker 4:  nothing new. Right. And there's no, they hinted at the new

1000
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,920
Speaker 4:  platform. I never thought we were gonna see it. They hinted at cheaper cars.

1001
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,480
Speaker 4:  I never thought we were gonna see it, but we didn't see it. And the stock

1002
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,720
Speaker 4:  price collapsed.

1003
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,640
Speaker 5:  It sounded to me like a long presentation of Elon's people

1004
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,320
Speaker 5:  telling investors why they're going to need a lot more money for the next

1005
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,280
Speaker 5:  period. Yeah,

1006
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,560
Speaker 4:  I got some of that vibe. You know, there was something really interesting.

1007
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,920
Speaker 4:  So Tesla is very innovative as a company and like the way they

1008
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:12,320
Speaker 4:  design package and build cars is new and

1009
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,320
Speaker 4:  novel, right? This core argument they're making, which is that a big car

1010
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,120
Speaker 4:  company like a GM or Ford or whoever is, or VW is like

1011
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,920
Speaker 4:  their job is to go buy parts from lots of suppliers and they integrate all

1012
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,200
Speaker 4:  the the parts and there's like so many parts in the car and that's why they're

1013
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,760
Speaker 4:  hard to upgrade over the air and all this stuff. Like all that is a hundred

1014
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,080
Speaker 4:  percent true. It's just that was the argument at the beginning of Tesla.

1015
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:34,960
Speaker 4:  That was the argument when the model three was coming out, right? We're we're

1016
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,240
Speaker 4:  now making a mass market car. We've designed and built it from the ground

1017
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,840
Speaker 4:  up. We are using less computers, less supplier

1018
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,880
Speaker 4:  computers in the in the car. We are designing the manufacturing in the same

1019
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,400
Speaker 4:  time as like this is all to me, this is all very familiar

1020
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:53,880
Speaker 4:  to the Tesla story we've heard for years. It's also really familiar to the

1021
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,480
Speaker 4:  story of every other kind of high-end ev startup

1022
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:01,360
Speaker 4:  that we are now familiar with. Like when you go hang out with Rivian,

1023
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:05,560
Speaker 4:  they tell you a story about how traditional car makers are lazy and they

1024
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,400
Speaker 4:  don't realize the cars are computers. None. Like there was just a weirdness

1025
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:13,320
Speaker 4:  to Tesla restating their core value proposition

1026
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:17,080
Speaker 4:  in that way because it's the mar for the larger part of the market.

1027
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,240
Speaker 4:  This is always what they've been investing in, right? It's Tesla makes better

1028
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,080
Speaker 4:  cars cuz it designs them differently and it's more, much

1029
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:28,040
Speaker 4:  more of a computer company than a car company. But we are now at the

1030
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,560
Speaker 4:  point where Ford is like, we've done it like we split ourselves into two

1031
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,160
Speaker 4:  divisions and we're gonna act this way too. Like there was just something

1032
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,560
Speaker 4:  weird there. I was like, it's weird to see Tesla repeating itself.

1033
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,040
Speaker 1:  Well and I think this was, this kind of reinforced a lot of investors

1034
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:43,880
Speaker 1:  fear that he was spending too much time with Twitter and not enough time.

1035
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,560
Speaker 4:  Cause he was tweeting during the investor day.

1036
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,440
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And so he, and then he was like, he, like I think Elon has definitely

1037
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,880
Speaker 1:  gotten to a point where he has forgotten that actually he does owe people

1038
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,840
Speaker 1:  things he does just because he is the richest man in the world on paper.

1039
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,160
Speaker 1:  Well, not anymore. Oh,

1040
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:57,320
Speaker 4:  He

1041
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,440
Speaker 1:  Is again, is he again, he's back. He's got a lot of other people that he

1042
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,080
Speaker 1:  has obligations to. And I think he keeps forgetting that because he's like,

1043
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,880
Speaker 1:  oh, I got a tweet and it's real important. Yeah. And, and the investors kind

1044
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,520
Speaker 1:  of reminded him.

1045
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I think there's a real world in which any one of the

1046
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,240
Speaker 4:  deputies we saw at Tesla yesterday, he could say, you're the CEO now.

1047
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,640
Speaker 4:  And that might be a good thing. The same way like when Shotwell is a, the

1048
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:23,600
Speaker 4:  C SpaceX but very much in charge of SpaceX. He doesn't have that person

1049
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,280
Speaker 4:  at Tesla. He does not have that person at Twitter delegating hot

1050
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,840
Speaker 4:  management tip fresh from decoder. You should sometimes delegate some things.

1051
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:34,920
Speaker 4:  He didn't roll out the new master plan. It is about renewable

1052
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,680
Speaker 4:  energy. It's not really about building cars. He wants to increase the world's

1053
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:42,480
Speaker 4:  energy storage capacity. They have some new ideas about battery

1054
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,360
Speaker 4:  technology. Elon, he's like, this will need substantially less than

1055
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,800
Speaker 4:  30% of all nickel on earth. Which is an incredible thing to say.

1056
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:54,000
Speaker 4:  It's just good. It's like, yeah, you know, I have a plan, don't worry.

1057
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,680
Speaker 4:  It'll be less than 30% of all nickel on the planet. It's like,

1058
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,840
Speaker 4:  yeah, you should, you should set your goals high. And then they talked a

1059
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,280
Speaker 4:  lot about just in general manufacturing more efficiently. And then they did

1060
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,840
Speaker 4:  spend some time talking about full self-driving and how they think

1061
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:11,240
Speaker 4:  they get full self-driving out the door. The cars will be taxis, the cars

1062
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,240
Speaker 4:  will be in service more often. They'll be driving themselves around making

1063
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,640
Speaker 4:  money for you while you're sleeping. And that will go a long way to sustainability.

1064
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,760
Speaker 4:  That was the part of the whole presentation where I was like, what are the

1065
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,480
Speaker 4:  car? No, like, we're a long way from there,

1066
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,720
Speaker 4:  like as far away from that as we are from optimists.

1067
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,440
Speaker 5:  And you've already promised it and didn't deliver it for several years. Right?

1068
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,240
Speaker 5:  We, we've heard it.

1069
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,120
Speaker 1:  I'm just thinking of the day where like, you forget you left something in

1070
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,600
Speaker 1:  your car and you send your car out to be an Uber and like

1071
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,240
Speaker 1:  your, your laptop's in there, your child something, your

1072
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:43,360
Speaker 4:  Your

1073
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,840
Speaker 1:  Child. I don't know. I don't have a kid. I assume people sometimes forget

1074
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,000
Speaker 1:  them in their cars. Look,

1075
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,320
Speaker 4:  If you get my car and Max is in it, it's actually the rates goes up.

1076
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,560
Speaker 4:  She's very entertaining. She happily sing you any song

1077
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,480
Speaker 4:  from Encanto you want while you're on your way to your destination.

1078
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,360
Speaker 1:  She's the mc for the ride. She's got a little

1079
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,080
Speaker 1:  like bowler hat on. She's like, welcome.

1080
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:08,160
Speaker 4:  She'll tell you any number of jokes about butts. She's very funny, very into

1081
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,120
Speaker 4:  them. She's four. And yeah, I just, the the whole thing I think kind of

1082
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:15,200
Speaker 4:  landed with a thought. It landed with a thought with the, the Tesla fanboys

1083
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,400
Speaker 4:  who were expecting the c u car and, and said, got very long

1084
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,880
Speaker 4:  explanations of like assembly efficiency in

1085
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,400
Speaker 4:  factories.

1086
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,680
Speaker 5:  And some of 'em couldn't get into the event with the whole Mars blog guy.

1087
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,880
Speaker 5:  Like there were people who were supposed to be able to be there who suddenly

1088
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,200
Speaker 5:  couldn't.

1089
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But then they tweeted Elon, they got in

1090
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,960
Speaker 5:  Of course, because customer service is what he does now.

1091
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,480
Speaker 4:  That's his whole job. So that's Tesla. There's some other AI news

1092
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,080
Speaker 4:  this week that I wanna talk briefly. There's this new filter on TikTok that

1093
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,600
Speaker 4:  Jess weathered and me, as Satya wrote about, it's called Bold Glamor. So

1094
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,680
Speaker 4:  normally a new filter on TikTok, not a huge news mode. These are really interesting

1095
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,160
Speaker 4:  for two reasons. One, TikTok rolled out a new set of tools for filter

1096
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,960
Speaker 4:  creators that use AI tools that in

1097
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,760
Speaker 4:  particular gns, generative adversarial networks. We've covered these a

1098
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,440
Speaker 4:  lot on the site. Basically point to networks as each other and make them

1099
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,360
Speaker 4:  fight. So what this thing is doing is, is actually

1100
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,240
Speaker 4:  replacing faces. So before TikTok

1101
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,200
Speaker 4:  would like make a 3D model of your face, layer the fake eyebrows on

1102
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,680
Speaker 4:  it, and then layer that over your face so you could break it really easily.

1103
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,600
Speaker 4:  It was very obvious that this is a filter. This is actually replacing

1104
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,000
Speaker 4:  your face.

1105
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,920
Speaker 1:  So it's like deep faking you with hotter

1106
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,800
Speaker 4:  You. And it, it's, it's like smart in like uncanny ways. So

1107
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,760
Speaker 4:  it knows a more feminine face from a more masculine face on more

1108
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,840
Speaker 4:  feminine faces. It puts like loads of eye makeup and contouring on my

1109
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,080
Speaker 4:  face. It just like smooths my skin. It makes my jawline straighter.

1110
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,680
Speaker 4:  Which is really annoying because I look amazing in eye makeup. Just give

1111
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,800
Speaker 4:  it to me just like, let me have it

1112
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:49,120
Speaker 1:  Like eyeliner improves all faces.

1113
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:53,040
Speaker 4:  I look fucking amazing an eyeliner and TikTok won't let me have it. It's

1114
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,680
Speaker 4:  very annoying. So Jess and Mia wrote about it. They talked to some

1115
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,440
Speaker 4:  experts in the field. It's obviously gn. And we assumed

1116
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:04,560
Speaker 4:  that TikTok were just like happily confirmed this information. They

1117
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:08,040
Speaker 4:  rolled out the filter tools, they rolled out the first party filters. People

1118
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,920
Speaker 4:  are going crazy for 'em. It's fairly obvious what's happening here. It

1119
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,640
Speaker 4:  is very impressive. I encourage you to go try it. And TikTok is silent for

1120
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,400
Speaker 4:  a full week. Just like, won't even respond to the emails why, like,

1121
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:23,480
Speaker 4:  why It's, it's utterly bizarre. And then when you started

1122
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,080
Speaker 4:  looking around at the other media coverage and Fox News is out there being

1123
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,880
Speaker 4:  like, this is psychological warfare on young women. NBC News

1124
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,680
Speaker 4:  called it terrifying. And it's like, oh they TikTok just doesn't

1125
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,480
Speaker 4:  want anyone. Like they're already in so much trouble and people wanna ban

1126
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,400
Speaker 4:  TikTok so bad that they're out there being like we've created deep fake filters

1127
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,520
Speaker 4:  that put makeup on young women. Like they're gonna get kicked outta the country

1128
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,880
Speaker 4:  even faster. It's like totally weird corner of the culture war.

1129
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:52,880
Speaker 1:  It's super, because these filters have been pretty common for a while

1130
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,720
Speaker 1:  now, right? Like the, the filters that make people slightly more pretty.

1131
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,080
Speaker 1:  Chi China's doing doing that for years. Your phone, if you bought a ch phone

1132
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,040
Speaker 1:  in China and you took a photo of yourself with it, a lot of times you'd be

1133
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,320
Speaker 1:  like, oh, I didn't remember I put on an eyeliner today cuz the pH the phone

1134
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,280
Speaker 1:  would just add it for you. So this is like very, very common

1135
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,520
Speaker 1:  in other cultures, in other places and in America

1136
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,320
Speaker 1:  where suddenly everybody, everybody is now thinking about this in a way that

1137
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,200
Speaker 1:  a lot of places, particularly Fox News wouldn't normally think.

1138
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,560
Speaker 1:  Fox News is not really the place I go for really

1139
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,720
Speaker 1:  insightful commentary on representation of gender.

1140
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:30,840
Speaker 4:  No,

1141
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:34,600
Speaker 1:  Just not, not my, not my first stop. And now they're like, yeah, it's a culture.

1142
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,320
Speaker 1:  They're we're being destroyed from the inside. I was like, well welcome to

1143
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,320
Speaker 1:  the struggle. Have you looked at your own desks yet?

1144
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,240
Speaker 4:  There has been a lot of coverage on on the right and I'm trying my best

1145
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,880
Speaker 4:  to ex it's, I'm trying, there has been a lot of

1146
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,880
Speaker 4:  coverage on both sides about social media and young women in

1147
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,160
Speaker 4:  particular. A hundred percent like recent coverage about the depression and

1148
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:59,080
Speaker 4:  like this is part of it, right? Yeah. Is people see the filters. I

1149
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,640
Speaker 4:  think the filters are reality or they wanna look more like the filter. There's

1150
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,840
Speaker 4:  been a wave of plastic surgeries to look more against. Random filters are

1151
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,120
Speaker 4:  all real and now you've got a filter that doesn't even look fake. Right?

1152
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,200
Speaker 4:  It looks super real.

1153
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:14,280
Speaker 5:  That that's the difference here, I think. And why it has struck people here

1154
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,400
Speaker 5:  is that it actually works really well.

1155
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,360
Speaker 4:  You have to decide what working means.

1156
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:20,680
Speaker 5:  I I didn't say it's good. It just works.

1157
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,480
Speaker 4:  Right? It works well and that the thing it's doing to replace your face

1158
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:28,320
Speaker 4:  is impressive. The actual like makeup

1159
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:32,240
Speaker 4:  look on some people is great. On some people is fine and some

1160
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,000
Speaker 4:  people looks bonkers. Yeah. And so Jess, you know, like it's her photo at

1161
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,600
Speaker 4:  the top of our story. She's like, this makes me look like a troll. Like I

1162
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,440
Speaker 4:  hate the way this looks on me. The thing is that it just looks very real.

1163
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:45,320
Speaker 4:  And I that's, I think there's a, there's an entire tech

1164
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:49,200
Speaker 4:  culture verge story in there that has been distorted into

1165
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,880
Speaker 4:  the, this is Alex's point that has been distorted into the Fox News headline

1166
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,360
Speaker 4:  of this is Psychological Warfare.

1167
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:58,280
Speaker 5:  And it does, it does look like a person who's had contoured and heavy makeup

1168
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,800
Speaker 5:  on, but it looks like an actual person's face even though it really doesn't

1169
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,760
Speaker 5:  look very much like your real face is looking at all.

1170
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:07,480
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like if I could contour as well as this thing does,

1171
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,040
Speaker 1:  I would be a makeup artist.

1172
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. But I can't, I see it won't even, it won't even let me see what

1173
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,160
Speaker 4:  would I look like?

1174
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:16,600
Speaker 1:  It's always creepy when you, when you do get that that contouring the really

1175
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,520
Speaker 1:  heavy stuff that like Kim Kardashian is super known for, like

1176
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,240
Speaker 1:  she was kind of popularized that type of contouring. You're like,

1177
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,680
Speaker 1:  am I a witch? What's happened here?

1178
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:28,520
Speaker 4:  What's my

1179
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,280
Speaker 1:  Face is different. People go oh, and you're like, is it a good o

1180
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,240
Speaker 1:  is it a bad O And this just lets you do it without having to

1181
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,840
Speaker 1:  like spend hundreds of dollars at Sephora.

1182
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:41,960
Speaker 4:  It doesn't let me do it. You keep talking about it. Like I can, it

1183
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,600
Speaker 5:  Won't even run on my phone. It won't run on the pixel.

1184
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It only runs on iPhones. Right? It's, there's a lot going on here.

1185
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,120
Speaker 4:  Like I said, it's a very vergie story and the amazing thing about it right,

1186
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,000
Speaker 4:  is we're talking about something that it's base level is just a really cool

1187
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,520
Speaker 4:  piece of tech, right? Whether or not it's the technology is being pointed

1188
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,400
Speaker 4:  at do contouring or whatever else. It might be the

1189
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:05,040
Speaker 4:  underlying in real time we're doing generative

1190
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,480
Speaker 4:  adversarial networks to remap your face

1191
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:12,840
Speaker 4:  at a frame rate that is close enough for video. That's cool. And then

1192
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,200
Speaker 4:  it's the culture war is just come for it to the point where TikTok won't

1193
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,560
Speaker 4:  even talk about the technology because the, the culture wars I gotta control.

1194
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:23,640
Speaker 4:  So that one is the one we're, we're tracking. Speaking of Mia, right as

1195
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,480
Speaker 4:  we came on air, we have talked a lot about CNET and the use

1196
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,520
Speaker 4:  of AI to write SEO spam. Basically

1197
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:34,520
Speaker 4:  we, I feel like I can just condense that story into what's happening. It's

1198
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,360
Speaker 4:  a very complicated story but Right. They're using AI tools to write

1199
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,280
Speaker 4:  SEO spam articles to get you to sign for credit cards. Natural results of

1200
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,720
Speaker 4:  that CNET today laid off 10% of its ma,

1201
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:49,080
Speaker 4:  which is really bad. I mean we, these are people we know, these are, these

1202
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,960
Speaker 4:  are our competitors. I don't like it. But you can see this thing is

1203
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,800
Speaker 4:  happening where we've talked a lot about AI in the context of Google. It's

1204
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,200
Speaker 4:  like CNET turning into the AI content form. Yeah. First they're just gonna,

1205
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,520
Speaker 4:  the private equity company, right? Ventures, they're gonna gut cnet, right?

1206
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:07,400
Speaker 4:  But they're gonna point the automated tools at winning Google

1207
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,760
Speaker 4:  search terms until Google is forced to contend with it. Cuz that's, that's

1208
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,920
Speaker 4:  the money. And then right as we're coming on air here,

1209
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:18,560
Speaker 4:  Mia broke the story that the editor-in-chief of CNET

1210
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:22,400
Speaker 4:  is stepping down and becoming the AI content

1211
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,400
Speaker 4:  head of the,

1212
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,000
Speaker 1:  Hmm. That's brutal.

1213
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:29,800
Speaker 4:  It's sad folks. I don't, I don't love it. I don't like it.

1214
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:34,000
Speaker 4:  This is the future. I hope you enjoy the vergecast because

1215
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,880
Speaker 4:  soon it will just be chatbots or doing with each other about our hair

1216
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,320
Speaker 4:  blasters

1217
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:42,480
Speaker 1:  That happened to someone on our staff this week. They didn't realize

1218
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:46,560
Speaker 1:  that they had, I believe it was Otter AI activated

1219
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:50,600
Speaker 1:  and it joined a meeting for them that they couldn't attend and just started

1220
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,560
Speaker 1:  like chatting at everybody in the meeting. And everybody's like, why are

1221
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,960
Speaker 1:  they ignoring us? And, and not not talking to us. And they just accidentally

1222
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,760
Speaker 1:  activated some sort of AI chatbot to show up to a work

1223
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,040
Speaker 1:  meeting.

1224
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:04,760
Speaker 4:  This is my dream is it. Soon all of our meetings will just be our chatbots

1225
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,280
Speaker 4:  talking to each other

1226
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,040
Speaker 1:  And they come back to us with, with like, here's what everybody discussed.

1227
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:12,920
Speaker 1:  Nothing actually happened. You still have to go slack with each other.

1228
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:14,920
Speaker 4:  So like most meetings,

1229
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:20,720
Speaker 4:  just to be clear, most meetings in corporate America are exactly

1230
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,600
Speaker 4:  that thing. Bing on the other side, Microsoft's

1231
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,520
Speaker 4:  added some personality tools to bing. I think there's been a real, I

1232
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,000
Speaker 4:  dunno how you two feel about this. So I'm curious. There has been a real

1233
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,840
Speaker 4:  reckoning of whether Bing is actually a replacement for search

1234
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:39,160
Speaker 4:  or it's just a thing that various very smart tech writers wanna

1235
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:39,480
Speaker 4:  smooch.

1236
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:43,640
Speaker 5:  I finally got access to it unfortunately after they, they nuked

1237
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,560
Speaker 5:  the personality a bit and I used it. I, there was something I was looking

1238
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,920
Speaker 5:  up and I knew that I wasn't gonna be able to Google it very well. I, I've

1239
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,000
Speaker 5:  used Google a lot, I can tell when it's gonna give me an answer or not. And

1240
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,520
Speaker 5:  I decided to search in Google and also in Bing. And

1241
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,040
Speaker 5:  neither one gave me the answer that I wanted. The answer, the summary response

1242
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,880
Speaker 5:  that Bing eventually gave me was decent. It was decently written, it was

1243
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,760
Speaker 5:  easy to read, but it didn't have the information I was looking for. And it

1244
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:09,280
Speaker 5:  was slow. By the time it actually popped up, I had done three Google searches

1245
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,720
Speaker 5:  and you know, it was kind of closer to getting the kind of question that

1246
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,680
Speaker 5:  I wanted. So no, it, I don't think it's there yet as a search

1247
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,200
Speaker 5:  replacement.

1248
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:21,160
Speaker 1:  It's improved versus chat. G P T cuz in both of 'em, I just asked

1249
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,040
Speaker 1:  who I was and chat. G P T was like, she works at Laptop Magazine

1250
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,640
Speaker 1:  and I was like, oh, that's a while back folks. That's a while back. And,

1251
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,040
Speaker 1:  and like the Bing one gave me a much, it was like, oh, it made me sound fancy.

1252
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:35,760
Speaker 1:  I felt very great for a day. But, but it still struggles with like

1253
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,760
Speaker 1:  the searches I do want. Like if I'm thinking about oh I want like what's

1254
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,400
Speaker 1:  the best kind of pants or whatever, I don't, I don't wanna go and search

1255
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,120
Speaker 1:  that on Google cause it's all SEO spam and Bing's not helping

1256
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:49,720
Speaker 1:  because it's still seems to be based on Bing search results.

1257
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:53,480
Speaker 1:  And I've been trying to use Bing just to like experience

1258
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,440
Speaker 1:  the magic boy. It's not magical. Like just

1259
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,720
Speaker 1:  the straight ahead Bing search engines real

1260
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:04,480
Speaker 5:  Bad. So they integrated Bing with Windows 11 now and it's really just a button

1261
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,480
Speaker 5:  on your search bar that when you click it, it shows you the news widget that

1262
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,080
Speaker 5:  you were already ignoring. And then you click Bing again and it opens up

1263
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,480
Speaker 5:  edge to the same Bing chat app that everyone else has. It, it's just a button

1264
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,520
Speaker 5:  that that's what they did.

1265
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:18,520
Speaker 4:  Here's my idea for Bing. They should stop pretending that it's

1266
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,280
Speaker 4:  a search engine and just let it be a dating sim. Just let

1267
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,080
Speaker 4:  people date Bing. People pay for Tinder Gold. Be like it's eight bucks

1268
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,560
Speaker 4:  a month and you're dating it now.

1269
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,000
Speaker 1:  It will not go with you to the wedding this weekend.

1270
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,000
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's your girlfriend from Niagara Falls. Just like, it's fine.

1271
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,800
Speaker 1:  But it will find someone on Craigslist to go to the wedding

1272
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,760
Speaker 1:  with you this weekend.

1273
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:41,160
Speaker 5:  Just to complete the Windows Mobile Nokia

1274
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,640
Speaker 5:  Triangle. I agree with Steven Kovski. That's basically what he said.

1275
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:47,440
Speaker 4:  Wait, Steven OVS said people should be allowed to date Bing.

1276
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,640
Speaker 5:  Not in so many words. He, he said that they should consider these things,

1277
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,360
Speaker 5:  features not bugs and just let it go do that and stop trying to challenge

1278
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,840
Speaker 5:  Google as a search engine. Yeah.

1279
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,280
Speaker 4:  But that the money is in search that this is the problem. Like the business

1280
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,640
Speaker 4:  model that Nadela is excited about is taking any dollars away from Google

1281
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,520
Speaker 4:  search and everyone else is like, what if you could kiss it and like,

1282
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,080
Speaker 4:  there's not as much money there,

1283
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,160
Speaker 1:  But you can make that money you

1284
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:14,000
Speaker 4:  Charge. It's not the same amount of money. Like one is the, the most lucrative

1285
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,800
Speaker 4:  business model in the history of the internet. And the other one,

1286
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:19,880
Speaker 1:  The other one's a very lucrative business model for

1287
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,400
Speaker 4:  Millennia in the history of the world in a different

1288
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,280
Speaker 5:  Way, but not on the same scale. And, and it's one of those things that comes

1289
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,920
Speaker 5:  up I think every time people ask about like, why is this company blocking

1290
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:32,360
Speaker 5:  at olden porn content from their thing? Because it doesn't make as much money

1291
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,040
Speaker 5:  as Google does.

1292
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:37,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's very good. Last little bits here. Sony

1293
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,680
Speaker 4:  announced it's 2023 TV lineup. Finally. They didn't do it at ces.

1294
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,680
Speaker 4:  Looks pretty good. New gaming menu, Alex.

1295
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,000
Speaker 1:  Some nice TVs.

1296
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,680
Speaker 5:  There's an anime button on the remote.

1297
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,320
Speaker 1:  Yes. It's got the, it's got the crunchy roll, like the, the trajectory of

1298
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,080
Speaker 1:  crunchy roll, which was originally where you would watch fan

1299
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,800
Speaker 1:  subs of anime. It was all pirated. And then the guy went, the guy like

1300
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,640
Speaker 1:  made some deals with anime companies in Japan so

1301
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,520
Speaker 1:  he could have the anime air at the same time on his pirate channel.

1302
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:09,520
Speaker 1:  And now it's a button on a, like the trajectory from that to

1303
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,480
Speaker 1:  owned by Sony to now being on the Sony remote just

1304
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,600
Speaker 1:  delights me to no end.

1305
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:16,560
Speaker 4:  Yeah, good for them.

1306
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:20,720
Speaker 8:  I just have to get in here and say, as the representative of two

1307
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:24,560
Speaker 8:  gigabit internet speeds that they're top of the line.

1308
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:28,920
Speaker 8:  Sony a 95 j I think is the letter this year.

1309
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:33,200
Speaker 8:  4K one 20 capability, but it

1310
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:37,080
Speaker 8:  still has a 100 megabit per second ethernet board on it. I just,

1311
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:42,360
Speaker 4:  What do you need more than a hundred megabits per second to your tv?

1312
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:46,600
Speaker 8:  Well, how about for the Sony streaming service that supposedly

1313
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,560
Speaker 8:  delivers you Blu-ray quality 4K content or

1314
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,320
Speaker 5:  Streaming definitely legitimate rips from your plex server that are completely

1315
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:54,840
Speaker 5:  uncompressed.

1316
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,560
Speaker 8:  I I don't know what you're talking about. I I I have to go now.

1317
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:01,840
Speaker 4:  All right. Alu ray. Okay. 4K Blu-ray is a hundred megabits. I got you

1318
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,000
Speaker 8:  Saying that's crazy.

1319
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:08,080
Speaker 4:  But that's a un that's like an uncompressed Blu-ray. There's not a streaming

1320
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,120
Speaker 4:  service in the world that delivers a hundred

1321
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,920
Speaker 8:  Megabits. According to them, they need at least 80 megabits

1322
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,080
Speaker 8:  per second for their streaming service.

1323
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:17,200
Speaker 5:  This only service that no one uses.

1324
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,520
Speaker 4:  This is like, just to go back to ver hits from the eighties.

1325
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,000
Speaker 4:  Remember when Sony like no one remembers this only, I remember this one year

1326
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,520
Speaker 4:  at ces, Sony was like, we have a new 4K streaming device.

1327
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:32,640
Speaker 4:  Yes. And it will download 4K movies in the background. It was a silver

1328
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,120
Speaker 4:  circle with a light. It was a huge, it was like a,

1329
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:40,280
Speaker 4:  an oval and it had a a light. Like that's, this was the pro. And I was like,

1330
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:43,880
Speaker 4:  can I see it? And they took me to the booth and they showed me

1331
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,760
Speaker 4:  very proudly this device that they were gonna release to consumers along

1332
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:50,200
Speaker 4:  with their first wave of 4K TVs that would download 4K movies in the background

1333
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,240
Speaker 4:  and you'd be able to buy them. And it was a whole thing. And I was like,

1334
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:56,040
Speaker 4:  is this actually it? And they were like, no, that's just a

1335
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,720
Speaker 4:  box with a light in it. And they like pulled back a curtain and they're like,

1336
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,880
Speaker 4:  this PC is where it runs right now.

1337
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,840
Speaker 4:  And I was like, only at Cs do you get to fully announce just a box with a

1338
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,840
Speaker 4:  light and be like, we're gonna figure this out.

1339
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,760
Speaker 1:  Don't worry about it. We got this. It's coming.

1340
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,880
Speaker 4:  Needless to say the Sony box with the light did not upend the streaming

1341
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,360
Speaker 4:  landscape,

1342
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:19,360
Speaker 1:  But they do have a very expensive service where you can

1343
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,240
Speaker 1:  like, and it it's, it's me. It's kind of like a better version

1344
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:27,040
Speaker 1:  of what Apple does. When you buy or rent a movie from Apple, they actually,

1345
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,720
Speaker 1:  those movies are higher bandwidth than what you would watch on

1346
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:34,360
Speaker 1:  Netflix or something if same movie because it downloads the whole thing

1347
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:38,920
Speaker 1:  to the Apple TV device. And so Sony has like tech that does

1348
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,680
Speaker 1:  kind of similar. So for nerds like Liam and I who really want like

1349
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:46,980
Speaker 1:  to see every little piece of film grain, it's nice.

1350
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:47,340
Speaker 1:  But

1351
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,260
Speaker 4:  Aren't you downloading that anyway? No,

1352
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:49,940
Speaker 1:  I just aren't

1353
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,780
Speaker 4:  Prefetching that content. You're not streaming it over ethernet to your tv.

1354
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,660
Speaker 5:  We, we all need the extra headroom.

1355
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:59,740
Speaker 4:  We all need. Fine. Can I just say, I just got, I recently received the new

1356
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,100
Speaker 4:  PDF of stir file I on Apple News.

1357
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,940
Speaker 1:  You ready? You're gonna tuck in.

1358
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:09,220
Speaker 4:  It's very good. In the entire editor's letter was written about chat, G B

1359
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:13,180
Speaker 4:  T and he asked it if cables made a difference and chat G PT

1360
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:16,620
Speaker 4:  was like, I know what you want. And it was many paragraphs

1361
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,340
Speaker 4:  about why some cables are better than others.

1362
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,580
Speaker 1:  Chat G PPG gets it.

1363
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:28,100
Speaker 4:  I was like, no, this is wrong. This is pure

1364
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,500
Speaker 4:  misinformation. This is the most dangerous misinformation that's ever been

1365
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,260
Speaker 4:  printed. They're just H G M I cables, man. It's ones and

1366
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:35,780
Speaker 4:  zeroes.

1367
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:38,060
Speaker 1:  Some htm I cables are better than

1368
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:39,420
Speaker 4:  Others. So, no, that's it.

1369
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,420
Speaker 5:  Monster Cable is back. It's just, here we go.

1370
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:45,460
Speaker 1:  It's happened. You gotta get the gold plated man. That's how you know

1371
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:49,020
Speaker 4:  There's nothing that brings me greater pleasure than tucking in with my iPad

1372
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,980
Speaker 4:  in the latest PDF of staring Filing scene. I love it so

1373
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:55,700
Speaker 4:  much. I can't believe I haven't been doing this for years since Apple News

1374
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:59,340
Speaker 4:  Plus came out. But it's true. This is a true story. I'm telling that he was

1375
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,220
Speaker 4:  just like, let's see if Chad g d can write the editor's letter. And it was

1376
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,900
Speaker 4:  like, cables are great. It's a lot. Okay, lastly

1377
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:08,380
Speaker 4:  this Microsoft phone link iMessage thing.

1378
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,460
Speaker 1:  Richard's pumped

1379
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:13,380
Speaker 4:  A lot of controversy this week. So Microsoft releases a tool. They have phone

1380
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:17,300
Speaker 4:  link on Windows, which I dunno if you have it, but they're like, you can

1381
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,500
Speaker 4:  now use iMessage trainer PC with it and what they're doing.

1382
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:24,580
Speaker 4:  Microsoft, the company that is at once the forefront of the state of the

1383
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,060
Speaker 4:  art, whether it's emotional chatbot that will just lie to you about whatever

1384
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:28,700
Speaker 4:  you want it to.

1385
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,940
Speaker 1:  And then you wanna kiss it.

1386
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:34,540
Speaker 4:  They're like, here's what we're doing. We're bluetoothing into your phone.

1387
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:37,540
Speaker 4:  We're reading the notifications that come in and passing them

1388
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:41,420
Speaker 4:  to your computer as though it's a message.

1389
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,860
Speaker 4:  The hackiest of all hacks. So

1390
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,020
Speaker 5:  It's like your car when you get a text message.

1391
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,980
Speaker 4:  Yep. They're using the exact same pass through, right? There's a little

1392
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:53,180
Speaker 4:  notification standard and you can send 'em back. Right? You can, you can,

1393
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:56,220
Speaker 4:  you're, if you have voice integration in your car, you can usually send a

1394
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:59,700
Speaker 4:  text back out and then iMessage will decide if it's an iMessage or a text.

1395
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:03,300
Speaker 4:  Microsoft using the same tool. But is that not the happiest hack that has

1396
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:03,820
Speaker 4:  ever existed?

1397
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:07,620
Speaker 1:  I love it though. Like they were like, no, we're gonna do it. Apple won't

1398
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:11,600
Speaker 1:  give us the tools, so we're gonna gonna just ha one of the largest companies

1399
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,960
Speaker 1:  in the world is just gonna hack it.

1400
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,040
Speaker 5:  But Apple is letting them and they're, they're friends now. You can get your

1401
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,080
Speaker 5:  Apple TV app on Windows. It's all cool. Every everybody, everybody's cool.

1402
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,480
Speaker 5:  You just can't get real iMessage on Windows. That's

1403
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,640
Speaker 4:  All everything but iMessage the thing that keeps you on the iPhone forever.

1404
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:28,000
Speaker 4:  It's true. Elizabeth Warren, well again, about to jump through the wall.

1405
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,800
Speaker 4:  Kool eight man interoperability, she screamed. That's the ver everybody

1406
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,640
Speaker 4:  we've gone over time.

1407
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,400
Speaker 1:  Liz is coming for us.

1408
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,920
Speaker 4:  If anyone wants to draw me a cartoon of Elizabeth Warren jumping through

1409
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,880
Speaker 4:  a window screaming at interoperability, we'll run it. I'll put it on the

1410
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,640
Speaker 4:  website tomorrow. Just keep that in mind. You can send 'em to Alex. She's

1411
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,320
Speaker 4:  at Alex h grandson Twitter. Richard is at RJ c

1412
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:51,320
Speaker 4:  I remain at Reckless. I check it once a day and retweet funny jokes.

1413
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:54,880
Speaker 4:  So that's what, that's how I'm using Twitter. You can also call us for eight sixty six

1414
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,480
Speaker 4:  Verge 11. Alex, what happened on the Wednesday show?

1415
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:00,480
Speaker 1:  Okay, so the Wednesday episode, I actually can't tell you it's gonna be something

1416
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,680
Speaker 1:  really special. People are really gonna be excited when they get it in their

1417
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,440
Speaker 1:  feed. The Monday episode, we've been doing this really great series called

1418
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,360
Speaker 1:  Solo Acts with Ashley Escada. She's a absolute delight

1419
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,960
Speaker 1:  every single week. She and I run over our allotted time just chatting.

1420
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,600
Speaker 1:  She's great. But she's talking to Madison Carr, who is a game

1421
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,440
Speaker 1:  designer who designs her games all by herself even though

1422
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:26,240
Speaker 1:  it is potentially more lucrative to go and and join a big studio.

1423
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:30,600
Speaker 1:  And she's going to explain exactly why that is. And it's a really great answer.

1424
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,040
Speaker 1:  I loved it.

1425
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:34,280
Speaker 4:  Well, those are great. I really like having Ashley on the show. I know a

1426
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,760
Speaker 4:  lot of you have tweeted at us about how great she is. Keep listening to her.

1427
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,000
Speaker 4:  It's been fun to have her on. And then next week we're at South by Southwest.

1428
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:45,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And we're doing a special episode live at South by Southwest

1429
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,000
Speaker 4:  with some special guests, including a returning special guest. We're very

1430
